Though we all crave novelty from time to time , having a library of old favorites practially guarantees that you 'll be making the clothes that you really want to wear . Your tried and true pattern library might include quick projects like knit t-shirts and tank tops , staples like pencil skirts , or even coats and jackets . <p> Learning seasonal fabric swaps let 's you make the same styles you love season after season . <p> You might notice that ready-to-wear designers do this all the time . At least a few of the same styles appear season after season in their collections , but in completely different fabrications . The benefits are clear : the designer does n't  have to invest in creating and testing as many new patterns , she knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consistent look . When you think about it , you can gain those same benefits . <p> But choosing the right fabric for these designs is where many sewists get stuck , especially when making them at a completely different time of year . A lovely sheath that worked well in linen last summer might have you stumped as the weather gets cooler . And a skirt that seemed perfectly cozy in winter is hard to imagine when its broiling hot outside . <p> Try our interactive fabric selector at the bottom of this article ! <p> The trick is to understand the properties of fabric and what makes them suitable for a particular style , as well as what makes them work for a given season . Once you have those concepts clear , it becomes much easier to open up the possibilities of fabric choice . If you know why that linen worked so well with that particular dress , you can research other fabrics that have those same qualities . Soon , you 'll be on your way to finding fabrics that suit your designs in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four properties of fabric and how you can use them to map out new fabric choices for each season . The first two properties have to do with the seasonality of the fabric : the fiber its made from , and its color/print . These two factors largely determine whether a fabric will work in the fall , winter , spring , summer , or all year round . <p> The second two properties are what determine if a fabric is suitable for a particular style of garment : its weight and drape . These are the two characteristics that are the most helpful to you as you evaluate fabrics to go with a specific pattern . If you understand the weight and drape you need for a style , you can vary the fiber and color to choose seasonally appropriate fabrics that still match the lines of the garment . <p> 01 Section <h> Seasonal Properties : Fiber and Color <p> The fiber a fabric is made from and the color its dyed or printed largely determines its suitability for any given season . <p> Color is the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit the season . <h> Color <p> The single easiest and most obvious way to adapt a pattern for a different season is to change the color of the fabric that you use . Making the same dress in a deep indigo blue or forest green in winter can give it a completely different feel from the same dress in white or rose pink in the summer . <p> Of course , you do n't  need to feel obligated to wear frothy pastels in spring or jewel tones in fall if either palette does n't  quite suit your style . Clothing is a language , and its first job is to say something about you as the wearer . Clothing tells your story ; if part of that story is your relationship to the current season , you can use color to express that . Even if you prefer a limited color palette , the tones of those colors can express something about the time of year and environment you 're living in . <p> Prints can also say something about the season . Menswear-inspired patterns ( such as pinstripes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stripes , gingham checks , or pretty florals definitely convey more of a springtime mood . Once again , you do n't  need to stick to these to be " in season , " but they make it easy to change up the same pattern for a completely different look . These colors and prints can be interpreted and tweaked to suit you . <p> Wool and silk fabrics are perfect for cool months , and cotton , rayon , silk , or linen all work well when its warm . <h> Fiber <p> The next property that can be changed to make a garment more seasonal is the fiber its made from . Every fabric is made up of yarns that come from one or more fiber sources , and choosing a fabric made with particular fibers can make it fit the time of year and give you more wardrobe variety . Some fibers are simply more comfortable to wear in either hot or cold weather , while others trandscend season . Well take a look at a few common fiber types you may want to consider as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant-derived fiber that works well for the warmer months , due to its high absorbency and breathability . This makes it especially useful in humid conditions . Cotton fabrics are also easy to wash and care for , soft , and not prone to irritating the skin . <p> Silk : A strong natural fiber that can be spun quite fine , silk is known for its luxurious look and feel . Silk does not conduct heat , which makes it a good choice for keeping you warm in the winter . Its also quite absorbent , making it suitable for warmer months as well . And becuase silk is such a strong fiber and can be spun so fine , silk fabric can be made in a wide variety of textures and weights . It is a wonderful all-year fiber . <p> Rayon : Originally manufactured as a silk substitute , rayon is a semi-synthetic fiber that maintains many of the characteristics of natural fibers . Rayon is well known for keeping the skin cool , and you 'll notice that mens hawaiian shirts are often made of rayon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especailly in hot weather . <p> Linen : Another plant-derived fiber , linen is a strong fiber that is highly breathable and absorbent . Its exceptionally low heat conductivity makes it even cooler than other natural fibers such as silk or cotton . For hot and humid weather , nothing can beat the coolness of linen . <p> Wool : This animal fiber is well known for keeping you warm in winter , since it is highly insulating while still maintaining its breathability . It is also moisture wicking and highly absorbent . It is a little more difficult to care for than other fibers , since it is not a very strong fiber and is prone to shrinkage and pilling . <p> These are just a few common fiber types that you can vary for the season . Sometimes , it really is as simple as swapping out a fiber to find a similar fabric that will work for a different season . For example , you could make the same dress in a pale blue rayon crepe in the summer or in a navy blue wool crepe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so simple . For example , how do you know what a good winter substitute might be for cotton voile ? What if you wanted to make a summer version of your favorite flannel dress ? <p> In cases like these , its helpful to understand why a particular fabric works with the design you 've chosen , so you can find something with those same properties in a more seasonally appropriate fiber , or just a different texture so you can vary the style . <p> 02 Section <h> Textural properties : Weight and Drape <p> To make sure your fabric will work with the pattern you 've chosen , look at the properties of weight and drape . <p> There are two main fabric properties that determine whether a fabric is appropriate for a style of garment : weight and drape . Both of these properties have to do with how a fabric feels more than how it looks , which is what makes buying fabric online a little tricky at times . Its hard to tell if a fabric will work with your pattern if you cant feel its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you understand these two properties , devising your own fabric swaps to suit the season becomes much easier . Simply knowing that you 're looking for a fabric with a particular sort of weight and drape , and then finding seasonal fabrics that fit that profile , makes choosing the right fabric much easier . <p> You can see thickness clearly when your fabric is on the bolt or folded . <h> Weight <p> The weight refers to the actual thickness of a fabric . Some fabrics are extremely thin , and the lightest of these are often so thin that they 're sheer . Other fabrics are thick and bulky , like the fabrics youd use to make a heavy coat . You can feel the difference when you handle the fabric . Imagine picking up a 20 yard bolt of chiffon , and then imagine lifting a 20 yard bolt of thick upholstery wool . The chiffon is n't likely to throw out your back . <p> The weight of a fabric is often determined by the thickness of the yarns used to create the fabric , with light and sheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is n't always the case , though . Sometimes , the particular way a fabric is woven or knitted can make the fabric thicker . For example , the pile of velvet makes it quite heavy , and double knits like Ponte di Roma are thick due to the special way they 're knit . <p> The important thing is to recognize what sort of a weight you need for your style of garment . If your pattern needs a light fabric , a heavy one will add unecessary bulk and thick , bulging seams . If the pattern requires a heavy fabric , a light one might look strange , appear wrinkled , or show more of your body than you intended . <p> Draping fabric around a form , bolts , or any other object allows you to see how crisp or drapey it is . <h> Drape <p> Drape is the way the fabric responds to gravity . Some fabrics collapse toward the floor , while others seem to stand up on their own . Fabrics that collapse are said to have a lot of drape , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a lot of body . <p> Drape is sometimes confused with weight , because the two properties often interact . Lightweight fabrics are assumed to be drapey and flowing , and heavier fabrics are assumed to be more crisp . This is often the case , but not always . The two properties should be considered independently of each other . There are light fabrics that are very stiff , and there are heavy fabrics that are relatively soft and drapey . <p> Like weight , drape has to do with the texture of a fabric . This means that the best way to assess the drape is to actually feel the fabric . To test the drape of a fabric , you can wrap it around your body and see how it behaves . If all you have is a swatch , hold it up on the bias by grabbing a corner and see if it falls straight down . Choosing a fabric with the appropriate amount of drape will help you maintain the intended look and design lines of your pattern style . <h> How to plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric : light , medium , or heavy <p> Determine the amount of drape of the original fabric : from very soft and drapey to very crisp . <p> Choose a fiber for the season you are sewing for ( perhaps cotton for summer or wool for winter ) . <p> Find a fabric type in your chosen fiber , drape , and weight . <p> Find the right color and print for the season and the look you want . <p> Once you have a handle on the textural properties of weight and drape , you can experiment with swapping the seasonal properties of color and fiber . Start with your pattern and determine the type of weight and drape that it requires . Do you need crispness to achieve a sharp , tailored look ? Does the garment need to flow around the body ? Should the fabric be heavy or light ? If you 're using a pattern the suggestions on the envelope will help give you clues about the sort of drape and weight needed . <p> Once you 've figured these out , think beyond the envelope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season you 're sewing for . If you need ideas , see our chart below to help you decide what kinds of fabric might work for your needs . <p> 03 Section <h> Fabric swap ideas <p> Follow the interactive diagram below to find fabrics ideas that might work with your pattern , no matter what the style or season . Of course , some fabrics come in various weights and drapes , so this is a rough approximation . It should give you some good ideas about what to seek out the next time you 're in project planning mode . <p> Start by clicking the fabric weight you need , then explore the options from there : <p> You may want to start your own swatch book , with fabrics organized both by drape and by weight . This can help you brainstorm new ideas . It can be especially helpful when you 're shopping online , and need to use specific search terms to find the perfect fabric for your project . 
@@36822472 @5822472/ <h> How to sew an overlay <p> At my local fabric store , they often display their most eye-catching fabrics by draping and pinning them on dress forms , creating glamorous looks reminiscent of evening gowns . Recently , I was standing at the cutting table with my fabric when I noticed two gorgeous floral examples from across the room , one in soft green and one in pale yellow . They looked so ethereal that I had to walk across the store to take a closer look . <p> When I approached , what I found was that these two looks were actually created from a single floral fabric , but each was overlaid in a different shade of pastel chiffon . The resulting look was multi-dimensional , taking on different shades when viewed from various angles . The colors were also beautifully subdued , with the overlay lending a single tone to all the vibrant floral underneath . <p> This 1950s vintage dress is a beautiful example of an overlaid floral look . Courtesy of Dear Golden Vintage . <p> You can sometimes find similar looks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when sheer overlays on cocktail dresses were extremely popular . Though overlays are mostly used over solid fabrics , when placed over bold floral prints , the result is floaty , dreamy , and feminine . They look particularly stunning with designs that incorporate folds and gathers , such as full skirts or draped cowl necks . <p> Both the overlay and main fabrics are printed on this vintage dress . Courtesy of Dear Golden Vintage . <h> Choosing your fabric <p> To add an overlay to a floral print , choose , colors , prints , and textures that work well together . To try out combinations , its easiest to either do this in person at a fabric store , or use swatches . A colored overlay can transform the look of the print underneath in unexpected ways , muting certain colors and brightening or deepening others . You may find your print looks nothing like you first imagined once you try it out . <p> Audition prints and overlay fabrics together with swatches before you begin to cut . <p> For the floral print beneath , use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the layering . Muted or small prints can appear muddy when layered . Bright colors will inevitably be tamed by an overlay , so do n't  be afraid to go a little bolder than you 're used to . Prints with a great deal of negative space between motifs also translate well for this look . <p> The high contrast black and white print works well beneath the black layer on this vintage dress . Courtesy of Dear Golden Vintage . <p> Even with sheer fabrics , a dark color will block more detail than a light color . <p> For the overlay , look for very sheer fabrics that will not block your print . Chiffon , lighter voiles , and organza are all suitable choices . Light colors will allow the print to show through more , while dark colors will give it a shadowed look . If you are working with a knit , try a light mesh fabric from the fabric store 's lingerie section . These fabrics are quite sheer but will still give you the stretch you need to work with a knit fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in creating this look is undoubtedly sewing the sheer top layer . Sheer fabrics are notoriously tricky due to their lightness and tendency to float on the cutting table and shift in the sewing machine . They can also be subject to pulled threads and puckering if you are n't  careful . <p> Spray stabilizer will give more crispness to sheer fabrics . The chiffon on the right has been treated with stabilizer . <p> Stabilize the fabric before cutting to make this process easier . Pre-wash all fabric and then apply a spray stabilizer such as Sullivans to the sheer layer . Once the stabilizer dries , the fabric will feel crisp and papery and will be less prone to shifting during both the cutting and sewing process . Stabilizer washes out after sewing , returning your fabric to its original pre-washed condition . <p> Use a sharp needle when sewing sheer fabrics , in size 60/8 , 65/9 , or 70/10 . Sheer fabrics can be sewn with either high-quality all-purpose polyester thread or a lightweight silk thread . Avoid heavier silk thread or low quality polyester thread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Narrow Seams <p> For seams , the goal is to make them as invisible as possible . Large , bulky seams with obvious stitching should be avoided . The best choice for sheer fabrics is a narrow French seam . These are very small , enclosed seams within the garment , which work best on lightweight fabrics . <p> A narrow French seam blends into sheer fabric . <h> Narrow French seam <h> Step 01 <p> With wrong sides together , stitch the seam using a 1/2 inch seam allowance . <h> Step 02 <p> Trim the seam to a scant 1/8 inch . <h> Step 03 <p> Press the seam allowance to the side . Turn the fabric with right sides together and press to form a crisp edge along the seam . <h> Step 04 <p> Stitch with right sides together , using a 1/8 inch seam allowance . <h> Inconspicuous hems <p> Hems are another important consideration when sewing sheer fabrics . Wide hems can detract from the look of a sheer garment , but they are particularly noticeable when used on an overlay because they block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the narrow hem techniques shown here . The rolled hem requires a specialty rolled hem foot , while the baby hem has a similar look without the need for the foot . <h> Rolled hem <p> The rolled hem is a classic choice for sheer fabrics but requires a specialty foot . <h> Step 01 <p> Attach a rolled hem presser foot to your sewing machine . Align the raw edge of the hem with the outer edge of the foot . <h> Step 02 <p> Sew 4 " 5 stitches , then lift the presser foot and pull the garment away from the machine . <h> Step 03 <p> Pull the threads to the back and place the hem beneath the foot again . Hold the threads at back and use them to guide the edge into the rolled section of the foot . Stitch the remainder of the hem , allowing the foot to guide the fabric into the crevice and roll it as you sew . <h> Baby Hem <p> A baby hem looks similar to a finished rolled hem but can be created without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line around your hem , 1/2 inch from the raw edge . <h> Step 02 <p> Fold the raw edge under along the stitching line and press . <h> Step 03 <p> Stitch a scant 1/8 inch from the fold . Trim the fabric right up to the stitching line . <h> Step 04 <p> Fold again to form a tiny hem and press . Stitch through the center of this fold to complete your narrow hem . <p> If you have a serger , use the rolled hem feature to create an easy narrow hem that works well for all lightweight fabrics . Remove the left needle on your serger and the stitch finger , and stitch using a short and narrow stitch setting . Try it first on scrap fabric , then raise the upper looper tension and decrease the lower looper tension until you see the fabric rolling to the back when stitched . <h> Create an overlay <p> To create an overlay for a skirt or any other garment , follow these easy steps . Shown here is the Bristol skirt from this months issue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from both the overlay fabric as well as the main fabric . Use only the main fabric to cut interior pieces such as pockets and facings from the main fabric . For a skirt such as the Bristol shown here , cut the waistband , front , and back pieces . <h> Floating or fitted ? <p> Before deciding how youd like to construct your garment , consider the overall design lines . Do you intend for your garment to be fitted with an overlay that just lends texture or tone to the fabric ? Or do you want an overlay that floats away from the body , such as on a full skirt ? <p> This will determine the order of sewing . If your intent is to have the overlay float atop the main fabric , its important that the overlay and main fabric are sewn together in as few places as possible . On the other hand , if your garment is worn close to the body , this is not a concern , and you can place the overlay on top of the main fabric before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use different methods for various parts of the same garment . For example , if you are making a dress with a fitted top and full skirt , you may want to use one overlay technique for the bodice and a different one for the bottom . <h> Fitted garments <p> For fitted garments with darts , place the sheer fabric on top , then baste and treat the two pieces as one . Note that the dart overlap is not visible in the finished dress . <p> Fitted garments often have multiple seams and darts . When adding a sheer top layer to such a garment , hide these seams and darts as much as possible . To do this , place an individual overlay piece on top of each individual main fabric piece . Place with the wrong side of the overlay fabric facing the right side of the main fabric . Baste them together along the edges . <p> Once they are basted together , stitch any darts . Continue constructing the garment as if each piece is one . This is a very simple way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once the pieces are basted together . However , it is most suitable for fitted garments such as pencil skirts or sheath dresses . <h> Floating garments <p> For floaty garments , keep the background fabric and overlay fabric as separate as possible . Note that the skirt and overlay are not sewn together at the side seams . <p> If you want your overlay to float , sew the pieces for each main section of the garment separately from each fabric . For example , if you are making a simple skirt , sew the skirt side seams together in the main fabric and then sew the skirt side seams in the overlay fabric . Construct the waistband from the main fabric and a separate waistband from the overlay fabric . <p> If your garment has details such as in-seam pockets , the easiest solution is to omit them . This type of pocket can interfere with the look of an overlay , because the overlay will need to be sewn to the main fabric along the seams that contain the pockets , preventing the floaty look you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the layers together only along the pocket openings . <p> If you 'd like to keep the pockets , cut the pocket bags from the main fabric only . With the overlay and main fabric together , sew the pockets to the edge of the garment . Stitch the pocket bags together along the curved edge . Sew the seams above and below the pocket , stitching each layer separately . If you are using a French seam , clip the seam allowance carefully at the edge of the pocket to allow the seam to be turned . <h> Adding Zippers <p> If you are sewing a fitted garment with a zipper , install the zipper with the main fabric and overlay fabric as one . Do not sew the layers together below the zipper . Complete each of the seams below the zipper separately , keeping the overlay and main fabric detached below the closure . <p> Note that the zipper is sewn with both layers together at the top , but the layers are separate below the zipper opening . Courtesy of Dear Golden Vintage . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave an opening for the zipper on the main pieces , as you usually would . On the overlay , do not sew the seam that holds the zipper . Instead , finish each side of the seam separately with a rolled hem or a baby hem . For example , if you are making a skirt with a left side seam zipper , finish each raw edge of the left side seam separately with a tiny hem . <p> Install the zipper in the opening you left in the main fabric . Sew the overlay seam closed below the zipper opening . This leaves a gap in the overlay , allowing the zipper to be opened and closed , but allows the overlay to hang loose from the zipper . <h> Baste layers together <p> Place the overlay over the main fabric units . The wrong side of the overlay should face the right side of the main skirt . Baste the overlay to the main fabric along the remaining seams . For example , for a skirt , baste the pieces along the waistline . At this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other details that add fullness . Finish sewing the garment together . <p> Hem the overlay and main skirt separately . Choose an appropriate hem for the main skirt . For the overlay , use a rolled hem or a baby hem ( see above ) . <h> Resources <p> How to sew a rolled hem : This complete tutorial with step-by-step photos shows you how to create a rolled hem using the specially designed presser foot .

Courtesy of Adored Vintage . <p> Years ago , lingerie was made almost entirely from natural woven fabrics such as linen , silk , and cotton . Everything from nightgowns to corset covers to early brassieres used these simple fabrics , and the garments ranged from extraordinarily luxurious to plain and functional . <p> This began to change around World War II , when the DuPont company introduced nylon . American women became familiar with nylon as it came to replace silk in stockings during the war , when purchasing silk from Asia became impossible . Though there were soon shortages of nylon stockings as well , women had become accustomed to the many benefits of nylon : its stretch , comfort , durability , easy care , and stain resistance were all seen as great benefits . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of undergarments along with other new manmade fibers and elastics . It was used in everything from everyday slips to sexy peignoirs . Although some higher end lingerie was still made in delicate silk , a great many of the mass produced garments were nylon . <p> Today , things are different . While nylon is still used in lingerie and is a fine choice for many applications , both ready to wear and home sewn lingerie garments are made in a much wider range of fabrics , including both natural and synthetic fibers . You have an array of fabrics to choose from when making your own lingerie and loungewear , some of which you may not have considered before . Your choice in fabric will largely determine the final look and feel of any lingerie garment you make , so picking the fabric and fiber that 's right for you is one of the most important creative decisions you can make . <p> Nylon slips and other lingerie became extremely popular after World War II.This lace garter belt from the 1950s is constructed with a base of nylon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Fabric <p> When you begin planning your fabric purchases , be aware of the qualities you must look out for , and go to the fabric shop armed with research . <h> Factors to consider <p> Once you 've chosen a style of lingerie garment , whether its a full coverage bra , a lightweight sleep bralette , or a comfy nightgown , there are several important considerations that can help guide you . <p> Stretch : Look over your chosen pattern and determine if you require stretch , and if so , how much . If your pattern requires any stretch , it will usually give you a stretch guide or an indication of the percentage of stretch necessary . They will also tell you whether you need one-way stretch , which usually runs crosswise from selvage to selvage , or two-way stretch , which runs both lengthwise and crosswise . Confusingly , the term " two-way stretch " can also be used by some shops to refer to fabrics that only stretch crosswise . They will refer to fabrics that stretch in both directions as four-way stretch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be less ambiguous , but be aware of the labeling difference when shopping both in person and online . <p> Weight : The next major consideration is the weight of the fabric . Lingerie is usually meant to be close to the body , and often is worn beneath everyday clothing . If this is the case , consider the thickness and weight of the fabric , and whether it will add bulk to your body . For example , if you 're sewing a pair of panties , the last thing you want is the appearance of bulky seams around your tummy or waistline , so its best to stick with thinner fabrics that still meet your other requirements . <p> Feel : A final major consideration is the feel of the fabric . Lingerie is often worn close to the skin , and irritating fabrics will prove themselves a much bigger nuisance when rubbing against you all day . Try testing the feel of any lingerie fabric against a sensitive area of the skin , such as your neck or cheek .

Your pattern may call for a basic lingerie fabric such as nylon tricot , but if this is not a fabric you want to wear , you should feel free to open up your options a bit . After all , the main benefit of sewing your own clothing is to make something that fits you in the most personal way . <p> Carefully examine both the lingerie you own and what you see in stores to become familiar with designers choices . <p> Start by examining similar pieces of lingerie that you already own and love . Think about what makes them wearable or special to you . Do you wish you had more fine silk to wear every day under your dresses ? Do you love the comfort of a cotton jersey nightie ? Your choices may not be as limited as you thought , and exploring your own closet is often a good first place to look for alternate options . <p> Another way to open your mind to new possibilities is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine lingerie store in your area , take a visit to see how garments there are constructed .

Even if your local store is small or part of a large chain that caters mainly to crafters or quilters , it can be instructive to take a look at what they offer and get a feel for what you want ( and what you do n't  ) . <p> Online apparel fabric shops : There are many fabric stores online today that sell fabrics appropriate for lingerie , along with other apparel , craft , and home decor fabrics . Once you have an idea of the type of fabric you 're looking for , searching through their inventory becomes much easier . In particular , I have found online shops a great resource for jersey knits of all kinds , lightweight woven fabrics , and luxurious stretch wovens such as silk/spandex blends .

In this list , include the amount of stretch ( if any ) , the direction of stretch and the weight . It might also be helpful to jot down a few initial ideas on fabric types with the appropriate look and feel , which you can search out and adjust depending on what you come across . Start with a few ideas and stay flexible . <p> Also bring a small ruler or measuring tape when you shop . When you 've found a fabric you like , test the stretch percentage by stretching a small 5 inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below to determine the stretch percentage . If you are shopping online , use fabric swatches to determine the stretch if this information is not available . In some cases , you may be able to contact the shop owner if you can not find the information online . <p> Be sure to play around in the store , testing out stretch and recovery in all directions . <h> Stretch percentages <p> A 5 inch swatch stretches to : <p> 6 inches <p> 20% <p> 6.5 inches <p> 30% <p> 7 inches <p> 40% <p> 7.5 inches <p> 50% <p> 8 inches <p> 60% <p> 8.5 inches <p> 70% <p> 9 inches <p> 80% <p> 9.5 inches <p> 90% <p> 10 inches <p> 100% <p> After stretching your swatch , notice whether the fabric returns to its original shape .

This can indicate a fabric with poor recovery , which means it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will stretch out over time . <p> Finally , place the fabric near your skin to test the feel . Remember to try placing the fabric near a sensitive area , such as your neck . This will give you a better idea of what to expect with long term wear near the body . Everyone has a different tolerance when it comes to feel , so this is especially important if you have allergies or your skin is sensitive . <p> If you cant find a fabric that meets all of your needs at once , do n't  worry . You can combine fabrics in order to create exactly what you need . For example , let 's say you love the look of a rayon jersey and want to use it as cups on a bralette , but find that it has far too much stretch . The high stretch would lend almost no support and would make the final garment uncomfortable to wear . You could line the cups with a firm tricot , giving them more rigidity and support while maintaining the look of the fabric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two layers of fabric in the cups to create additional support . The matching Geneva panties require only one layer for more stretch . <p> 02 Section <h> Types of Fabric <p> There is a dizzying array of choices for making lingerie , far beyond what you might imagine . Well first take a look at fibers you may want to use , then discuss fabrics in both knit and woven varieties . <h> Fibers <p> Fibers are the building blocks of your fabric . Some fibers are manmade , while those known as natural fibers are derived from plant and animal sources . Well go over some common preferred options for lingerie . <p> These knits are made in a variety of fibers , which impart varying amounts of luster to the fabric . Clockwise from bottom left : cotton , silk , nylon , rayon . <p> Spandex : Also known by the DuPont brand name Lycra , spandex is a fiber with both high stretch and high recovery . It is used in everything from high performance activewear to dance costumes to ready to wear pants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly blended in small amounts with other fibers to increase stretch and recovery , and can be found in both knit and woven fabrics . <p> Nylon : Nylon is an extremely strong , elastic fiber that has been popular in womens lingerie for decades . It is easy to care for and wash , resists stains , and lasts a long time . It is not very absorbent , and the look can be somewhat dowdy depending on how its used . <p> Cotton : Cotton is a strong fiber with a soft hand and high absorbency . It is often printed , and can be found in a large array of prints in both knit and woven categories . Cotton fabrics often have a simple , casual look to them that works well for everyday lingerie garments . <p> Linen : While linen is not quite as commonly used in lingerie , it can be a great choice in warm weather due to its breathability . Linen is available both in knit and woven forms . Be aware that most linen fabrics are very prone to wrinkling unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the advantage of getting softer with use and washing . <p> Silk : A luxurious fiber made from the cocoons of insects , usually mulberry silkworms . Silk is most known for its lustrous finish , rich colors due to high dye absorption , and incredibly soft feel . Despite its delicacy , silk is a very strong fiber . <p> Bamboo : Bamboo has gained popularity in recent years due to its soft hand , antibacterial properties , and high absorbency . Most bamboo fabrics display great stretch capabilities , but always check the recovery of the fabric after stretching , as some forms of bamboo tend to stretch out over time . While some consider bamboo a highly sustainable choice , this has been up for debate due to processing and transportation ( see our article in this issue on sustainable fabric choices ) . <p> Rayon : A semi-synthetic fiber made from cellulose , rayon originally came into fashion as a replacement for silk . Its a highly versatile fiber that can appear similar to silk , wool , cotton , and other fibers . Rayon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it a great choice for summer garments . There are many types of rayon available with different properties , including lyocell ( also known by the brand name Tencel ) , modal , and viscose . <p> Technical fabrics : There are many technical fabrics on the market today primarily designed for activewear . These same fabrics can work quite well in undergarment applications , since they are designed to be worn close to the skin , are highly breathable and often moisture wicking , and have great stretch and recovery . See Melissa Fehrs guide to activewear fabrics in Seamwork Issue 02 to learn more . <h> Knit fabrics <p> Lingerie can be made from either knit or woven fabrics depending on the type of garment , the amount of ease and support , and the preferences of the wearer . Well first take a look at knit fabrics that are commonly used in producing lingerie . <p> Knit fabrics are created with a knitting machine , which produces interlocking loops of thread that allow the final fabric to stretch . Although you may think immediately of jersey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when making lingerie , from the tissue thin to the strong and sturdy . Knits come in a range of weights , finishes , stretch capabilities , and drapes . <p> The weight of a knit is measured in denier. 15 denier knit fabric is very lightweight and sheer . 30 is a medium weight knit , and 45 is a highly stable knit that you might see in supportive bra cups . <p> The most important consideration in sewing knits is to make sure that any seams you sew stretch along with the fabric , to prevent thread breakage . Sometimes a serger is ideal for sewing knits , since the overlock stitches produced by the serger are quite elastic . You can also use a narrow ( 0.5mm to 1mm ) zigzag stitch on your sewing machine to give seams more stretch . In some cases , such as sewing with a 45 denier tricot with very little stretch , a straight stitch will work just fine . Always test sew two small swatches together and stretch the seam to check for broken thread before you begin construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabrics used in lingerie sewing . You 'll note that some of these fabrics use a specific type of fiber ( described above ) , while others can be made from a variety of different fibers or from blends . <p> Tricot has a distinctive knit structure that 's easy to recognize when inspected closely . <p> Nylon tricot : Tricot is a warp knit fabric , with a structure that will appear different from typical weft knits such as jersey . If you look closely at the surface of tricot , the structure looks a bit like zigzags . This fabric is very common in lingerie , and can be used as either the outer fabric or as a lining . It is durable and usually thin and inexpensive . Nylon tricot comes in a range of opacities and surface textures , from sheer chiffon-like fabric to satin-finished . <p> Single jersey : When you think knits , you might think of jersey . Jersey comes in a wide array of fiber types , including rayon , bamboo , cotton , polyester , and more . It works beautifully for comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It also drapes well , making it perfect for nightgowns , flowing robes , and gathered babydolls . Jersey fabrics with spandex included have superior stretch and recovery , which is essential for some types of lingerie such as panties . Although it can be a bit lightweight for supportive garments such as bras , jersey can be combined with other lining fabrics to create a sturdier , more supportive option . <p> Light double knit : Double knit fabrics are created with multiple sets of needles to produce two layers of fabric that are knitted together . They tend to be thicker and sturdier than single knits , and are less prone to rolling or fraying . While thick double knits such as ponte are not ideal for lingerie , lightweight cousins such as cotton interlock can work quite well and give more strength and stability than a single knit . <p> Simplex : A double faced knit fabric used primarily for bra cups . It has four-way stretch , but very little of it . The lack of stretch gives excellent firm support . <p> The Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and part of the cups . <p> Stretch Lace : Stretch lace is available both as fabric in typical widths of 45 to 60 inches or more , or it can be purchased as a trim . Wide trims are ideal for creating insets , bands , or bra cups . Stretch lace has a high spandex content and good recovery , but the amount of stretch varies . If you find a stretch lace that is too stretchy , it can be lined with other fabrics for more support . <p> Mesh : Lingerie mesh is commonly used in panties , creating breathable , light and sheer panels . It is a light and delicate fabric that does not add much bulk , and can be used to provide light linings in bralettes , nighties , or panties . It can also be used to back lace , to maintain a sheer look while giving more strength and stability . <p> Power Net : Also known as power mesh , you will commonly see this fabric used in foundation garments such as girdles . It is a firm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also commonly used for the bands of bras . <p> Nylon/spandex satin knit : Satin knits are lightweight and commonly used to make panties . You may also find them in the costume or special occasion section of your local fabric store . <p> Stretch velvet : More of a novelty than most other lingerie fabrics listed , stretch velvet can be a fun addition to your lingerie wardrobe . The plush nap is soft and fun to wear , making great robes , leggings , or slinky slips . Be aware that stretch velvet does add bulk due to the pile , so opt to use it on garments that are not meant to be hidden beneath fitted clothing and that have minimal seams . <h> Woven fabrics <p> You do n't  always want or need stretch when sewing lingerie . Woven fabrics can give you both options . Woven fabrics are created on a loom , with yarns going both lengthwise and crosswise . Unless the yarns themselves have stretch , the fabric will not stretch in either of these directions . However , it will stretch along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bias is an option for adding stretch ( see our article on bias sewing in Seamwork issue 02 ) . <p> If the yarns of woven fabric are created with spandex , the fabric will have stretch . Though stretch wovens do n't  typically have the same high stretch capabilities of the stretchiest knits , they can often be substituted for firmer knit fabrics . For example , try swapping a stretch silk/spandex blend for a firm interlock knit . Test the stretch before you sew to determine if the swap will work . <p> Almost any lightweight woven fabric can be used to create gorgeous lingerie and loungewear . Here are a few options and possible applications to get you thinking . <p> Chiffon and georgette : These sheer fabrics are incredibly light , flowing , and delicate . Chiffon is the lighter of the two , and has an ethereal quality . Layers of chiffon can be used to build up different colors and tones within a garment . Georgette is similar , but has more texture and opacity . These fabrics are commonly made from silk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make lovely kimonos , or can form a sheer skirt on a nightie . <p> Organza : Organza is a magical silk fabric that is both light and sheer , yet stiff and strong . It tends to stand away from the body and creates volume . While this stiffness is not ideal for most comfortable lingerie , organza makes a perfect interfacing when you do n't  want to add a lot of bulk and do n't  want any stretch . <p> Charmeuse : Silk charmeuse is one of the most luxurious fabrics to wear near the skin . It has a satin weave that gives it a high shine and almost liquid appearance . Its been popular in lingerie since the early 20th century , and is still used consistently in high end lingerie . Many special occasion designer bras are created using a silk/spandex blend , also known as stretch silk charmeuse . <p> China silk : More commonly used as a lining fabric , china silk ( otherwise known as habotai ) can be a relatively inexpensive choice for undergarments such as slips . Its smooth next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not add bulk . <p> Crepe de Chine : Crepe has the flow of other silk fabrics such as charmeuse , but without the high shine . Crepe is dull and textured , so it does not show every lump and bump on the body the way a satin finish does . Silk crepe makes luxurious loungewear , pajamas , robes , slips , and nighties . <p> Vintage bras were sometimes made from a firm , rigid satin . To see more details on this bra , see our Behind the Seams column this month . <p> Satin : Satin refers to a specific weave that results in high surface shine . In addition to charmeuse , there are many other types of satin which have a heavier weight and stiffer body . Structured bras and support garments commonly used satin to give a smooth line under clothing while also providing rigid support . <p> Challis : This drapey , plain woven fabric was originally made from a blend of silk and wool , but is now most commonly found in fabric stores in the form of rayon challis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loungewear in hot weather . <p> These beautiful petticoats from the early twentieth century feature cotton batiste and lace . Courtesy of Adored Vintage . <p> Batiste : A fine fabric with a plain weave , batiste is usually made from cotton but can also be found in linen . Batiste is commonly used in heirloom sewing , so it makes the perfect background for slips with intricate lace , embroidery , and needlework designs . It is lightweight , but not entirely sheer . <p> Voile and lawn : These are plain woven fabrics commonly made from 100% cotton . Voile is the lighter of the two and is more transparent . Voile and lawn can be used to make lightweight summer lingerie , such as nighties , lightweight bralettes that do n't  require stretch , or boxer shorts . Printed lawns can make beautiful panel insertions when combined with stretch fabrics in bras and panties . <p> This 1920s camisole is constructed almost entirely of bands of lace pieced together . Courtesy of Adored Vintage . <p> Handkerchief linen : Linen is wonderfully luxurious in summer due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and washing . Linen sheets are highly valued , so why not bring this fiber even closer to your skin by making linen sleepwear ? Handkerchief linen is a lightweight linen with good drape , which makes it a fine choice for lingerie . It also looks beautiful with lace , embroidery , and subtle details such as hemstitching . <p> Lace : Lace comes in a broad range of styles , weights , and textures . Some laces are fine and soft , while others can feel scratchy near the skin , so always be sure to test a lace fabric before purchasing . You may find stretch lace a better option for constructing large parts of a garment , whereas non-stretch lace trims can add intricate detail without covering the whole body . <p> When planning your next lingerie or loungewear project , do n't  feel limited by the pattern envelope . While suggestions from the patternmaker are a perfect starting point , nearly any type of fabric can be used to create lingerie .

I had learned the hard way to design for the amount of time you have for execution . My plan for this project was to keep it simple . A trip to the fabric store soon squashed my modest plan , a luscious gold lame fabric caught my eye . <p> I knew I did n't  have the time to execute what I wanted so I foolishly went with a safe pink color that would be well suited to a simple shape . I finished my swimsuit with plenty of time , but I was completely unhappy with the results . Why did n't  I just go with my gut ?

This means that the finished garment measurements are actually smaller than the body measurements . Choosing a fabric with ample stretch ensures that you will be able to put the swimsuit on and actually move in it . <p> Two-way stretch fabric will accommodate stretch from selvedge to selvedge but does not offer much stretch in the length of grain .

Does the fabric become transparent when stretched ? If it has a print , does the print become distorted ? These are all important things to check for when working with fabric that has a high percentage of stretch . <h> Lining <p> Choosing the correct lining is also crucial when making your own swimwear . Halenka lining is ideal for swimwear projects . It offers a soft hand and four-way stretch making it an excellent choice .

Traditional polyester elastic will deteriorate quickly under these circumstances . <p> Cotton swimwear elastic is easy to work with and stands up well to chlorinated and salt water . Cotton swimwear elastic is woven with rubber to give it stretch and strength . Just like other elastic , it comes in a variety of widths and is quite inexpensive . <p> Rubber elastic can also be used when making swimwear .

After all , it is the means that literally holds your garment together . With swimwear , the stakes are a bit higher , as you do n't  have anything underneath so save you from a nip slip or worse . <p> Avoid cotton thread that will become weakened by chlorine and salt water . Instead , opt for a polyester thread . If you are using a serger to assemble your swimsuit , wooly nylon thread is strong and resilient making it perfect for swim and athletic-wear . Wooly nylon thread can also be used in your home sewing machine . <h> Basic Construction <h> Cutting <p> Cutting can be quiet daunting when making swimwear .

This will help to prevent any runs in your fabric . <p> The combination of a rotary cutter and pattern weights can help you to have more control as you cut . <p> Grain line matters ! Take extra care to make sure your pattern pieces are on grain before cutting . <h> Seaming <p> A serger or a domestic sewing machine can be used for the construction of your sewing machine . The following are my favorite techniques , using both types of machine . <p> Use a serger to sew swimwear fabric right sides together . Standard seam allowance for most swimwear projects is 3/8 " . Make sure your blade is engaged , as you will be cutting off approximately 1/8 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic sewing machine , a wide and short zigzag can be used in place or a serged stitch . A mock overlock stitch can also be a great option . Sew fabric right sides together and trim excess seam allowance . <h> Sewing elastic <p> In most cases , elastic is the means by which you finish the edges of your swimwear project . Proper application is key to getting a high quality finish . The most common technique used to apply elastic is the sewn and turned method . This technique offers clean and professional quality results that anyone can achieve at home in just five steps . <h> Step 01 <p> Elastic should be cut to be 25% smaller than the opening that it is finishing . To determine this , measure the edge where elastic is to be applied and multiply this measurement by 0.75 .

Not all swimsuits are designed to be compatible with underwire . If you know that this is a feature you must have in a swimsuit , look for a pattern that features cups that are attached to a full band , like Reno . Purchase underwire that corresponds to your bust size and the size swimsuit you are making . <h> Step 01 <h> Step 02 <p> Assemble the bra cups and attach cups to band using 5/8 " seam allowance and a straight stitch . <h> Step 03 <p> Finish the raw edge with a serger , or an overcast stitch . <h> Step 04 <p> Use a straight stitch to top stitch seam allowance up and toward the bra cup , sewing 1/2 away from the seam . <h> Step 05 <p> Insert underwire into the channel . <h> Step 06 <p> Sew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel to keep the underwire in place during the rest of construction . <h> Stays <p> Though stays do not actually support the bust in the case of swimwear , they do support the swimsuit by making sure it does n't  end up around your waist . Stays are applied in a very similar fashion to underwire . <p> A channel is created by top stitching approximately 3/8 " away from a seam . A stay is then inserted into this channel . <p> When choosing stays for swimwear , look for plastic options , as metal stays used for dress making will rust when exposed to water . Plastic stays can also be easily cut to size . <p> Always cut your stays to be 1/4 ? smaller than the finished measurement of your channel . This prevents the stays from stretching fabric unattractively . A nail file can be used to round the edges of plastic stays to prevent your stays from injuring you or your swimsuit . <p> Creating your own swimwear is a gratifying process .

This was before a time when there was ample sewing information on the Internet to support new and growing sewers . So instead of going to the library and checking out a book , or browsing old issues of Threads , I just jumped right in . Such a rookie mistake . You know how this story ends , because you probably have a similar tale of your own . <p> Years later , when the siren call of velvet beckoned me once more , I attacked the project armed with knowledge and a plan . I want to share all the tricks and tips I have learned from my own research and firsthand experience so you can have a tear-free velvet experience . <h> The Basics <p> Getting to know a fabric is essential to understanding its individual quirks and special requirements . A successful sewing project starts with selecting the correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Velvet is a type of pile fabric . Pile fabrics have a fuzzy , hair-like surface ; they include velvet , velveteen , corduroy , and terry cloth , just to name a few . There are two categories of pile fabrics that are manufactured in two different ways . <p> An up-close look at a rayon synthetic blend velvet . <p> An up-close look at a stretch velvet . <p> Warp refers to the threads that run along the length of a fabric , while the filling ( also know as weft ) are the horizontal threads that are woven through the warp . Warp-pile fabrics have an additional set of warp yarns , while filling-pile fabrics have an additional set of filling yarns . Both types of pile fabric have the same woven base , but the additional warp and filling pile yarns are what produces the fuzzy texture associated with velvet or corduroy . These pile yarns can either be left as they are ( uncut-pile weave ) , like terry cloth , or the pile yarns can be cut ( cut-pile weave ) , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woven as a double cloth . The warp threads interlace between the two pieces of cloth . Once the fabric is finished , a blade is used to cut the two pieces of fabric apart along the warp . This results in a soft , cut-pile fabric . Stretch velvet utilizes this same double cloth manufacturing process . <p> Pile fabrics come in a variety of fiber contents . Originally velvet was made of silk , but rayon and synthetic options are most common at the average fabric store . Even velvets labeled as silk velvet are often silk pile yarns on a woven rayon base . Try checking the bolt label for fiber content percentages or do a burn test to get a better idea of the fiber content . <h> Choosing a Pattern <p> Velvet is a sumptuous fabric that adds luxury to any project , but like any fabric , it is of the utmost importance to choose your project wisely in order to get the best results . Here are some things to look for when pattern shopping . <p> Idas simple silhouette and pullover design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fit and Silhouette : Velvet comes in a variety of weights depending on the fiber content and weight of the backing fabric . Consider this when choosing your pattern . Silk or rayon velvets tend to to be lighter weight with more drape , perfect for semi-fitted or loosely-fitted garments like Kenedy or Catarina . If you are working with a heavier velvet and are up for a challenge , tailored jackets and dresses are timeless classics that you will wear season after season . To add strength and durability to tailored velvet garments , consider adding an underlining to create additional structure . <p> Shaping : Generally , when working with velvet , less is more . Darts and contoured seams require lots of pressing , and velvet 's worst enemy is a heavy-handed iron . Look for patterns with gathers , pleats , or tucks instead . <p> Closures : Take the time to add couture-quality closures to velvet garments . If the pattern features buttons , consider bound buttonholes . For garments that require zippers , avoid invisible zippers ; often the pile can get caught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opt for hand-picked zippers for a high-end finish you wo n't regret investing your time in . <p> Stretch velvet offers an excellent opportunity to give pile fabrics a try with less hassle . Since stretch fabrics require less in the way of closures and shaping , you can try the cutting and sewing techniques outlined below without fussing over finer details . This is perfect for first-time velvet sewers ! <h> Prep <p> Every expert seamstress will tell you that if you want high-quality results it is essential to put in the necessary preparation . Taking the time to cut and mark accurately will help ensure precise sewing . <h> Cutting <p> The process for cutting velvet is very similar to that of cutting silk or other fine fabrics . The first and most important thing to know is you must cut velvet single layer . This will require you to make a few accommodations . For one , any pattern pieces that would have been cut on the fold should be traced so that the pattern is open . " <p> Though cutting fabric on the fold is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvet . Instead , cut velvet single layer . <p> Secondly , it is important to keep in mind that you will most likely not be able to cut your fabric according to the pattern layout . This is due to the fact that you are cutting single layer , but also because velvet has a directional nap . The best way to acquaint yourself with nap is to get your hands on some velvet . When you run your hand along the right side of the fabric , the pile will feel smooth when you move in the direction of the nap , and rough when you move against the nap . <p> On the left swatch the pile is facing down resulting in a duller color . On the right swatch the pile is facing up creating a more vibrant color . <p> It is key to cut all pattern pieces in the same direction . Traditionally , The pile runs down the garment , meaning that when you run your hand from the top of the garment to the bottom , the velvet will feel smooth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rich color , your fabric will appear more saturated if you choose to cut the garment with the nap running up the length of the garment . Regardless of which option you choose , just be consistent . <p> Carefully lay out all of your pattern pieces , making sure you have enough room . I like to use my phone to take a picture once I have tetris-ed everything together . <p> Now that you have prepped your pattern pieces and planned the cutting layout , you can finally cut into your fabric . Cover your cutting surface with tissue paper ; this is going to help you shift your fabric without compromising the grainline . If you are using a rotary cutter " which I highly recommend " place the cutting mat beneath the tissue . <p> Lay your velvet on top of your tissue and arrange your pattern pieces . Lightweight pattern weights are helpful for keeping your pattern in place . Use a rotary cutter or scissors to carefully cut out your velvet . <h> Marking and Stabilizing <p> Tailors tacks are easy to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will want to take your time . Tailors tacks are the way to go when marking velvet . I like to use tailors tacks to mark everything from darts to notches . Alternately , use a disappearing ink marker on the wrong side of your fabric . <p> Do n't  use iron-on interfacing when working with velvet . Instead , opt for sew-in interfacing . Silk organza is ideal for backing waistbands and collars . <h> Sewing <h> Always Test <p> For a professional finish , always test your stitches to ensure a smooth and consistent look . <p> You know those teeny tiny scraps that you either a ) hoard for no reason or b ) toss into the waste bin ? Those scraps are your most valuable tool for a smooth sewing experience . Before I even touch my cut fabric I always test sew some swatches . <p> If you are using traditional velvet , I recommend starting with a size 70/11 microtex needle . If you are using heavier velvet , a larger needle may be required . For stretch velvet , try a 75/11 stretch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of velvet 's pile , your average tension setting might be a bit too tight to accommodate the extra bulk . You may also want to also use a longer stitch length to help reduce tension issues . <p> If you are sewing stretch velvet using your serger , adjust your differential feed to ensure your stitch stretches adequately . Your stitching should allow for the same amount of stretch as the fabric itself . <p> Once you have made these adjustments , test on a swatch of fabric and make additional adjustments as necessary . Every sewing machine and fabric is different , so do n't skimp on testing . <h> Avoid Creeping <p> When hand basting a seam , try using a diagonal stitch pattern . This will help ensure that your fabric stays secure as you sew . <p> Anyone who has ever attempted to sew velvet before knows that what makes it tricky to work with is its tendency to creep . Creeping is the term used to describe two layers of fabric that shift independently as they are being stitched . The reason velvet creeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , the pile of the fabric slips against itself . This becomes especially apparent once your fabric is under your presser foot and you start stitching . <p> The most effective way to avoid creeping is to hand baste your seams prior to machine sewing . I promise you that hand basting is more time efficient than seam ripping inaccurate seams ! <h> Seam finishes and hemming <h> Pressing Velvet <p> With most sewing projects , your iron is your best friend , but that is not true for velvet . Irons can crush the pile of velvet , resulting in an uneven fabric surface . But do n't  worry ! Here are some ironing solutions . <p> Steam is your best friend ! Gently finger press seams , then apply lots and lots of steam on the wrong side of the fabric . <p> To protect the right side of your fabric while you steam the wrong side , try placing a scrap of your velvet with the pile facing up to help prevent your fabric from getting crushed . <p> Alternately , try using a towel or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it comes to finishing velvet there are three things you will want to avoid : topstitching , bulk , and " as mentioned before " intense pressing . Keep this in mind as you finish your velvet projects and you will be one step closer to having the gorgeous velvet dress of your dreams . <p> Velvet is a special fabric that deserves a special finish . For that reason , I like to line velvet garments whenever possible . In cases where a lining is not possible , keep seam finishes lightweight and simple , avoiding bound seams and French seams . Instead , opt for a serged edge or use an open zigzag stitch for a finish that wont add bulk to your seams . <p> Hems should take the same rules into consideration . Avoid bulk and topstitching by creating a single-fold , blind-stitched hem . Once your hem is securely stitched use ample steam to smooth your hemline . <p> Working with velvet and other luxury fabrics has taught me to slow down and enjoy the process . Rushing toward the finish line will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a gorgeous garment that will hang in your closet for years to come , take the time to cut with care , test your stitches , and hand baste your seams .

@@36822481 @5822481/ <h> Sewing Knits Without a Serger <p> As a sewing teacher , I have become acutely aware of a paradox that exists in the sewing community . Though the average persons wardrobe consists mostly of knitwear , the majority of seamstresses sew almost exclusively with woven fabric . This could be attributed to the misguided notion that sewing knits requires a serger . This is absolutely false ! Though a serger makes the assembly of knit garments much faster , they are a costly addition to your sewing arsenal and are not imperative . The following is a guide to sewing knits on your home sewing machine . <h> Handling <p> The stretch and resilience of knit fabric makes them such a joy to wear . Knits move with our bodies and active lifestyles , giving us room to grow and move . These qualities are what make knits unique , but also require us to handle them in a different manner . <p> Always reserve a few scraps to test your needle and machine settings . Test stitches with the stretch of the fabric and against it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require slightly different settings . Take note of these variations and store with your project as you work . <p> Do not stretch as you sew or resist the feed of your machine by pulling the fabric toward or away from you . <p> Support the weight of your project while you sew . Do not let it fall to the ground as it passes through your sewing machine . This will stretch your fabric and put unnecessary stress on your sewing machine . Instead , position your sewing machine so there is plenty of space for your fabric to be supported behind and to the left of your sewing machine . <p> If some stretch occurs during the sewing process , hover your iron approximately 1 " above the stretched seam and apply steam . The heat and moisture of the steam will help to shrink the seam back to its intended size and shape . <h> Preparing your Sewing Machine <p> Making a few simple adjustments on your machine before sewing will help you get off on the right foot when working with knits . Needles <p> Correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Universal needles have a slightly rounded tip and are intended for switching between wovens and knits . Though a universal needle can sometimes work for knits , it is always best to exchange your needle with a needle that is specifically intended for the task of sewing knit fabrics . <p> A needle with a rounded tip , commonly called a ballpoint needle is optimal . A ballpoint needle gently pushes through fabric , rather than piercing the fibers , helping to avoid runs and tears . A standard ballpoint needle is ideal for most knit projects . Ballpoint needles , also called jersey needles , typically come in sizes 70/10 to 100/16 . Use a smaller needle for finer knits and a larger needle for heavier fabrics . <p> If a knit has a significant amount of spandex or Lycra , consider using a stretch needle instead . Just like a jersey needle , stretch needles have a ballpoint intended for knit fabric , but the eye and scarf of the needle are specially designed to help when sewing elastic and also help avoid the skipped stitches , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically come in two sizes : 75/11 and 90/14 . <h> Presser Foot Pressure and Even Feed Foot <p> The presser foot of a sewing machine holds the fabric against your feed dogs as you sew . This action is what feeds fabric through the sewing machine . The amount of pressure the presser foot delivers to the feed dogs directly affects how your fabric looks when removed from your sewing machine . If the pressure is set too high , the result will be stretched out fabric that is rippled in appearance . To avoid this , adjust your presser foot pressure . Typically a setting of 1 or lower is appropriate for knit fabrics . <p> The location of this dial or lever can vary from machine to machine . Refer to your machine manual to learn more about the presser foot pressure on you sewing machine . <p> On the left , a seam sewn with help of a walking foot ; on the right , a seam sewn without . <p> An even feed foot or walking foot can also be helpful to gently and uniformly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs that help to pull your fabric through your machine at a more even rate . This can be a helpful tool when working with finer , more delicate knits . When shopping for an even feed foot be sure to purchase one that is intended for your sewing machine . Like most machine accessories , walking feet are specific to the brand of sewing machine being used . <h> Seaming <p> When working with wovens , the average seam consists of two parts . The first part is your construction stitch ; this is typically a straight stitch . The second component to a seam is a finishing stitch . These are like a zigzag stitch or other overcast stitches that finish the raw edges of your fabric and keep your project from unraveling . When working with knit fabrics you can use one stitch to do the job of two . This is one of the many perks of working with knits ! Here are some stitches that are ideal for the task of seaming knits . <p> It can be a helpful exercise to look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at the stitches being used to construct the garment . The first thing you might notice is the width of the stitches being used . The typical overlock stitch is 1/4 " in width . This width provides strength as well as stretch and is what we want to mirror when sewing knits on a home sewing machine . <h> Note <p> The seam guides on your sewing machine are only accurate when the needle is in the center position . When using stitches other than a straight stitch for construction , be sure to use a small ruler and painter 's tape to mark a new seam guide suitable for the stitch you are using . <h> Zigzag Stitch <p> A zigzag stitch is a great way to seam knit fabrics . Its inherent stretch allows for the fabric to stretch and move without fear of popping a seam . On light to medium weight knits , try using a stitch length of 1.5 and a width of 5 . This setting closely mimics the look and function of an overlock stitch . When sewing , remember to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure . To finish , trim the seam allowance close to stitching . This will closely emulate an overlock stitch and allow for maximum stretch and strength . <h> Faux Overlock Stitch <p> Most sewing machines will offer a variety of stretch stitches , many of which are intended to mimic the look of a serged edge . These stitches are aptly named overlock stitches . Check your sewing machine manual for the recommended stitch settings , though typically they tend to use a wide width and a short length . Keep in mind that many of these stitches will use a back-and-forth stitch path to create an elastic stitch . To avoid stretching when using this style of stitch merely support and gently guide fabric through the throat of the sewing machine . Resist the urge to stretch and sew ! Backstitch to secure stitching and trim to neaten the seam allowance edges . <h> Reinforced Straight Stitch <p> When working with thicker knits like ponte or heavy double knits , pressing the seam allowance open may be necessary . In these cases , a reinforced straight stitch can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinforced straight stitch is created by the needle moving forward and backward in a straight line , placing three parallel stitches side by side . <p> From left to right : a knit garment with a single fold hem , and a double fold hem on a woven garment . <h> Hemming <p> The biggest difference between hemming wovens versus knits , is that knits should be finished with a single fold hem . A double fold hem can create unnecessary bulk and cause the hem to roll toward the right side . When hemming knits at home , it is important to create a stitch that will stretch with your fabric . With these qualities in mind you have a few different options . In ready-to-wear , most knits are finished with a single fold hem and a machine called a coverstitch . A coverstitch machine produces a couple stitches : a chain stitch and a single or double-sided coverstitch . A chain stitch looks like a standard straight stitch from the right side but has a looped chain look on the wrong side ; this is what gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of parallel stitching on the right side , and on the reverse side it has the appearance of an overlock stitch . A double-sided coverstitch has the look of an overlock stitch on either side of the hem . <p> When planning your hem finish , it is important to consider the fit of your garment . The hem width will determine the amount of stretch the hem will need in order to get the garment on and off . <h> Twin Needle : For Fitted Knits <p> On the left , an example of tunneling created by using a twin needle . On the right , a perfect finish after a small adjustment to the bobbin tension . <p> A twin needle is your best bet if trying to imitate the look of a coverstitch . The stitch created when using a twin needle has the appearance of coverstitch from the right side , but on the wrong side , it looks like a zigzag stitch . This stitch has inherent stretch and is excellent for close-fitting knit garments . It is also highly beneficial to use when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from rolling toward the right side when wearing . <p> A twin needle will fit into any standard sewing machine . It has a single shank that is easily inserted just like a typical needle . Check your sewing machine manual to learn about threading for your make and model of machine . The tension and length settings recommended for twin needle use can also vary depending on your machine . <p> Use a small flat-head screw driver to loosen the tension of your bobbin case . <p> Tunneling is a problem commonly associated with twin needles . This is when the space between the two stitches is raised , creating a tunnel . To avoid tunneling , knit stay tape can be used to stabilize the hem of your knit garments by offering additional support without adding bulk to your hem . <h> Narrow Zigzag : For Garments with Ease <p> This can be an excellent option for wider hems that do not require huge amounts of stretch . At first glance this finish looks just like a straight stitch , but upon closer inspection you can see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch . Set your machine up for a standard zigzag stitch . Adjust your width to be a very narrow 0.5 and your length to be just a bit longer than normal , approximately 3 ( this may vary depending on how heavy or light your fabric is , so always test ) . You can also use a wider zigzag stitch to hem knitwear . The appearance of this can be very subtle if your thread is well-matched . <h> Reinforced Straight Stitch : For Firm Knits <p> A reinforced straight stitch can also be used to create the stretchable hem required for knits . Since this stitch creates a very bold stitching line , only use this technique when your thread matches perfectly or if you are using an intentionally contrasting thread color . The reinforced straight stitch is ideal for hemming stable knits that are firm with a fair amount of structure . This finish is not ideal for spongy knits , as it will produce an inconsistent finish . Avoid this method if you are working with a jersey knit that has a high tendency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to fear knits .

But when that coffee is soaking through the inside of your brand new satchel , things are even worse . <h> Uses for waterproof bags <p> Travel bags <p> Toiletry kits <p> Beach totes <p> Diaper bags <p> Wet bags <p> Camping or picnic bags <p> Bike panniers <p> This was my Monday a few weeks ago as I arrived at work to discover that I 'd failed to properly secure the lid on my brand new travel mug . Coffee soaked through the lining , through the pocket holding my laptop , and even though some of the seams , creating a puddle on the floor . Mopping it up with rags and spot treating with soap and water only went so far . My bag still smells of coffee . <p> If only my bag had been designed to be spill-proof , this mess would have been much easier to deal with . Bags that are designed to waterproof ( or even water-resistant ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide variety of activities and needs . You can take them to the beach or pool and throw damp towels into them . Use them as diaper bags , or make pouches to hold your babys laundry . Throw them on the back of your bike without worrying about rain .

These fabrics lean to the technical side , so some terms may be unfamiliar to you . <h> Types of fabric <p> Choose between water-repellent or waterproof outdoor fabrics , or laminated fabrics in interesting prints . <h> Water-Repellent Fabrics <p> Fabrics that are labeled water-repellent are not quite the same as true waterproof fabrics . These fabrics , often made from nylon , are designed so that water beads slowly rather than immediately penetrates the right side of the fabric . This is due to either the weave or finishing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will eventually be absorbed into the fabric , but it takes quite a bit longer than with regular fabric . This makes them a good choice for linings , if you do n't  anticipate heavy usage and spills . For example , if you want to make a tote bag for transporting damp towels and swimsuits to the pool , water-repellent fabric will likely do the trick . <p> SUPPLEX fabrics come in a wide variety of colors and will protect you from most small spills . <p> The most common brand name to look for is SUPPLEX , which is a treated nylon fabric . Its a breathable fabric , meaning that moisture can pass out of it . It also resists mildew and dries quickly . SUPPLEX even comes as a ripstop , which keeps any tears in the fabric from spreading . Taslan nylon is similar to SUPPLEX , but is engineered to look and feel more like cotton . <h> Waterproof Outdoor Fabrics <p> Waterproof outdoor fabrics are meant to be used in outdoor clothing and gear . These are quite different from water-repellent fabrics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric , waterproof fabrics usually have a coating on the wrong side of the fabric , which creates a strong barrier against moisture entering from the environment . In other words , the outside of the fabric may appear to get wet , but the inside stays completely dry . <p> Coatings on these fabrics are usually a type of vinyl , either a heavier coating of polyvinylchloride ( PVC ) , or a lighter coating of polyurethane ( PU ) . Waterproof fabrics with PU coatings will allow your fabric to move more while still holding its shape . You can identify these coating because they are thin and clear . <p> CORDURA nylon is well known for being virtually indestructible and offering true waterproof protection . <p> CORDURA is a common brand for waterproof fabrics . It is an extremely durable fabric that resists tears and abrasion , making it an ideal choice for heavy-duty bags . It can be used as an outer fabric for a sporty look or as a strong lining . You may also come across fabrics that are labeled waterproof breathable ( WPB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow water to pass out while preventing water to pass in . This makes it a great choice for outdoor clothing , though you may find it a bit expensive for a bag , where breathability is less of a concern . A common brand name for this type of fabric is GORE-TEX . <h> Laminated Fabrics <p> While waterproof outdoor fabrics are coated on the wrong side , laminated fabrics are actually coated on the right side with PU , giving them a slick and shiny appearance . Think of outdoor table cloths , for example . They are designed to be easy to clean up , making them perfect for either the inside or outside of a bag . <p> ; <p> Laminated fabrics such as patterned oilcloth are fun and easy to find . <p> Sometimes these fabrics are referred to as oilcloth . You will find them in bright colors and patterns in most fabric or craft stores . Confusingly , they are not actually coated in oil , but are made up of a layer of printed cotton with a thin PU coating on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( that is , cotton canvas impregnated with wax to increase water resistance ) is also sometimes called oilcloth or oilskin . These fabrics work well for the outside of bags , but not so well for linings due to their slightly tacky coating , which needs maintenance from abrasion . <p> You may also sometimes come across other laminated fabrics , such as laminated denim or laminated linen . These can make stylish bags with more subtlety than the brightly patterned oilcloths . These fabrics are still waterproof , but might rely more on texture than print to add interest . <p> 02 Section <h> Sewing a Waterproof Bag <p> To make a waterproof bag , first decide which layers youd like to make resistant to water . Lining your bag with water-repellent or waterproof fabric will keep it secure from spills from food and drink , and dry and easy to clean if you 're carrying damp objects . Using these specialty fabrics on the outside will keep the contents dry if environmental factors are more of a concern , such as rain and snow . <h> Choosing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . The first thing to think about is drape and body . Let 's say you 've decided to make a spill-proof bag by choosing one these fabrics for the lining . Do you want your fabric to give your bag stiffness and stability ? If so , using a stiff fabric like oilcloth for the lining will allow you to use a flimsier outer fabric and still have a bag with structure . If you 're pairing the lining with an outer fabric that 's already sturdy , you might instead opt for a lightweight water-repellent ripstop . <p> Waterproof or water-repellent fabrics can be used on either the outside layer or the lining . <p> The next question to ask is how much waterproofing you really need . For durable linings that will resist common spills from like food containers , a water-repellent fabric is likely to give all the protection that you need . If you plan to use your bag for hiking through streams and rivers , CORDURA might be up your alley . <p> Another consideration is the look and feel . Many waterproof fabrics have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can hide this fact by using these on the inside of your bag , and choosing a fashionable fabric for the outside . If you want a bright print , oilcloth is a good choice ; if you prefer versatility , you might opt for a simple nylon . Also consider whether you like the texture of fabrics that are laminated on the outside , versus the more traditional feel of fabrics that are coated on the wrong side . <h> Supplies <p> Needles : For waterproof and water-repellent outdoor fabrics , use a microtex/sharp needle in size 14 or 16 . For laminated fabrics , opt for a denim needle instead . <p> Clips : Paper clips or small binder clips can replace pins when holding fabric pieces together for sewing . <p> Tissue paper ( optional ) : A layer of tissue helps prevent laminated fabrics from sticking to your machine as you sew . <p> Walking foot or Teflon-coated foot ( optional ) : These specialty presser feet will also help move laminated fabrics along with less sticking . <p> Seam sealer ( optional ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seams with brush-on seam sealer or tape . <h> Cutting <p> When cutting water-repellent or waterproof fabrics , the most important thing to remember is that holes create leaks . Therefore , you should minimize the use of pins whenever possible . Instead , use pattern weights to keep your pattern on the fabric . Trace your pieces , remove the pattern , and cut ; or , use a rotary cutter . <p> When fabrics are laminated with PU or PVC , there is no longer any need to pay attention to grainline . With these types of fabrics , you can distribute your pattern pieces any way you 'd like . You can often save fabric by turning pieces in different directions . Be careful when doing this with patterned oilcloth fabrics , especially if the print is directional . <h> Stitching and Pressing <p> Again , its important to avoid perforations in your bag as much as possible . Instead of pinning fabric pieces , try holding edges together with small clips such as binder clips or bulldog clips . As a bonus , these clips will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you do want to use pins , be sure to pin only within the seam allowance . Place pins close to the raw edge , so that any holes in the fabric will not affect the overall quality of the bag . <p> Using clips instead of pins to hold the fabric together prevents punctures that cause more leaks . <p> If you are using coated or laminated fabrics , the vinyl surface can often stick to your presser foot or sewing machine , interfering with the ability of the feed dogs to guide your fabric evenly under the needle . To prevent this , place a layer of tissue paper between the vinyl surface and the sewing machine . Sew through the paper , and tear it away when you are through . A Teflon-coated foot or a walking foot can also be helpful when using a sticky fabric . <p> Increase the stitch length . This will create fewer holes in the seamline , so there is less leakage . When the holes are spaced further apart , there is also less risk of tearing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a ticket stub , making it much easier to tear . Try a few different stitch lengths on swatches to see what looks best and feels strongest with your particular fabric . <p> Mark the right side and wrong side of your fabric if it is n't obvious . <p> Remember that laminated fabrics have the coating on the right side of the fabric . In contrast , waterproof outdoor fabrics have coatings on the wrong side . When sewing with these outdoor fabrics , it may help to mark the right side with chalk to keep things clear as you sew . <p> For truly waterproof bags , you must seal your seams . No matter how waterproof the fabric is , seams will never be waterproof without additional treatment . You can purchase seam sealer as either a brush-on liquid or tape . This step may not be necessary unless you want a bag that is completely safe from moisture . Avoid pressing coated fabrics as much as possible , as the coating may melt . Always test with your iron on scraps of fabric before touching your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger press the seams and edges , or use a clapper to apply pressure without heat . After flattening the seams , topstitch to keep them flat and avoid bulk . If your bag calls for interfacing , use sew-in interfacing instead of adhesive or apply the interfacing to a different layer . <p> Coated fabrics wo n't fray , so there 's no need for finishing edges when using these . Uncoated fabrics may fray quite a bit and should be finished to prevent unraveling over time . This will keep your bag sturdy , since bags do undergo quite a bit of stress . Try serging raw edges , or use a zigzag or mock overlock stitch on your sewing machine . <p> Waterproof bags help you do more than prevent unexpected coffee mishaps . You can take them along during inclement weather or on hikes and picnics . You can transport food , pack your toothpaste for a trip , or take your baby gear along . With so many fabric options , there 's little reason not to keep your handmade bags dry and easy to clean .

Make sure that your snaps are compatible with your snap setter of choice . <h> How to Install with Snap-Fastening Pliers <p> After marking your fabric and pressing it to remove any creases or wrinkles , begin by setting the cap/socket side of the snap . <h> Step 01 <p> Place the snap cap right side down on the plastic platform with the metal prongs facing up . Then place the socket into the opposing plastic ring . The raised side of the socket should be facing the snap cap . Press firmly on the socket to firmly secure in pliers . <h> Step 02 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right side of the project facing the snap cap aligning the snap with the markings on project , and squeeze slowly and firmly . <h> Step 03 <p> This same method is employed to set the opposite snap . To set the stud side of your snap , place the stud face down on the plastic platform . Place the open prong opposite of the prongs facing towards the stud . Press firmly in place . <h> Step 04 <p> Place your fabric in the jaws of the pliers with the wrong side of the project facing the open prongs , lining up the snap with the placement markings . Squeeze the pliers slowly and firmly . <h> How to Install with Hammer and Anvil Snap Setter <p> The second option available for setting snaps at home is a hammer and anvil tool . This method requires three tools : a metal cup used to hold the unit in place during installation ; a metal anvil used to drive the two components together ; and a rubber mallet used to deliver the necessary force . The metal cup and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the snap 's size . <h> Step 01 <p> Start by securing the snap cap and socket side . Place the snap cap right side down in the metal cup , and place outer fabric right side down over prongs , taking care that the placement markings are aligning with the snap . Press down to push prongs through the fabric . <h> Step 02 <p> Place the socket over the prongs , with the sunken side facing up . <h> Step 03 <p> Cover the socket with the anvil and use the mallet to pound the snap into place . <h> Step 04 <p> Now secure the stud and ring side of the snap . Place the open-prong ring on the metal cup . Make sure that the prongs are facing up . Using the placement mark to align and place the inner fabric wrong side down over the prongs , pressing to secure . Lay the stud right side up over prongs . Cover with the anvil and use the mallet to hammer the components together . <p> Make sure the force being provided with the mallet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely . When impact is made with the anvil , the flat surface of the mallet should be parallel to your work surface . <h> Customizing Snaps <p> Painted snaps add a custom touch to your project . <p> You can also adorn your snaps with a customized color or design by using enamel paint . Many craft stores carry no-bake enamel paint in the jewelry-making section ; unlike most enamel paints , these do not require baking and will air set in 24 " 36 hours . A more common household item that can be used is nail polish . Here are some tips for creating durable customized snaps . <p> This technique can be used on both metal and plastic inlayed snaps . The inlayed snaps offer a controlled area while applying the paint , and the metal edge helps protect snaps from chipping . <h> Step 01 <p> Roughen the surface of the snaps . You can do this using low grit sandpaper or a nail file . Be thorough so the paint adheres to the snap better . <h> Step 02 <p> Clean the surface with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snap to dry completely . <h> Step 03 <p> Apply thin layers of nail polish , drying between coats . This will prevent the paint from bubbling . <h> Step 04 <p> To prevent smudging , dry for 12 " 24 hours before setting the snap . The hammer and anvil setting tool is gentler on the painted surface of the snap . To further protect the painted surface during setting , place a small scrap of fabric between the metal cup and the snap cap . <h> Snap Embellishment Ideas <p> Use a clear or matte topcoat to add additional interest and texture . <p> Try a glitter topcoat . <p> Use a toothpick to create polka dots , hearts , or other fun shapes . <h> Final Tips <p> Make sure that the snap components are properly centered in the snap-setting device . Otherwise , this may result in crooked setting . This is the case if the prongs of the snap are sticking out instead of nesting with their corresponding piece . <p> The correct pressure is of the utmost importance . If your snap is loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not enough pressure was applied while setting . <p> Try using additional force when setting your next snap . Some signs that you are applying too much pressure include cracked or dented snap cap , and torn fabric . Instead , try delivering less pressure with the hammer or pliers . <p> Always test your snaps on test fabric before applying snaps to your finished product . Different fabrics may require more or less pressure depending on their thickness and the density of the weave . Always purchase a few more snaps than you think you will need . Snaps can be tedious to remove ; practicing before committing to the final product is something you will never regret ! <p> A small flat-head screwdriver used for servicing your machine can be helpful . <p> To remove snaps , a flat-head screwdriver can be used to carefully lift the socket and stud away from the prongs fastening them to the fabric . Gently work your way around the perimeter of the snap , gradually lifting it away from the fabric . If the snap is proving to be very stubborn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side with the flat-head screwdriver . Once released , discard the used snap . 185425 @qwx385425 <p> Haley Glenn is a staff writer for Seamwork . She is a professional sewing writer and teacher based in Portland , Oregon . 
@@36822496 @5822496/ <h> Make It Reversible <p> You can make almost any garment work both ways by making a few smart choices . <p> The Osaka skirt can be made in up to four fabrics for two completely different looks . <p> I 'm always looking for ways to simplify my closet , especially as spring rolls around . It feels so good to fit most of my wardrobe onto a single rack , and it certainly makes getting dressed in the morning a bit easier . Plus , an intentionally small wardrobe makes packing for travel a breeze . <p> The secret to maintaining a small closet without getting bored is to aim for versatility in every piece . And there 's no beating a reversible garment for versatility . Just imagine if all your garments were reversible ; you 'd have double the wardrobe in the same amount of space . <p> Youd be surprised how many garments can be made reversible . While not everything works as a 2-for-1 , there are plenty of skirts , tops , dresses , and jackets that can be made to show off either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or go with monochrome texture like this ivory and grey version . <p> The Osaka skirt from this months issue is a prime example . This modern wrap skirt uses panels of fabric that allow you to create several different combinations of fabric and print in one . It also looks great as a monochrome skirt with textural interest . Imagine brocades , tweeds , or silks mixed with plain woven cottons in a single color , or a mix of florals and on one side for spring and autumnal browns on the other for fall . <p> There are a few things to keep in mind when sewing reversible garments of any kind . Well walk through the most important considerations : style , fabric , seams , and closures . <p> 01 Section <h> Choosing a style <p> Learn how to pick a pattern that can be made reversible . <p> The single most important consideration when making a reversible garment is the style of the pattern that you choose . In general , reversible garments are easiest to execute when the design lines are simple . Avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewing more difficult . <p> Wrap shapes are easy to make reversible , whether its a wrap skirt such as Osaka , a wrap dress , or a a blouse or sweater . Try to avoid patterns that have zippers , unless you can replace the zipper with another type of closure . <p> Also look for styles with minimal seaming . Eliminating seams wherever possible will help you to cut down on bulk between the layers , and you 'll end up with a smoother looking garment . If your pattern has a front or a back seam , see if you can cut these pieces on the fold instead . If a seam is only there for design interest and you feel it can be eliminated without sacrificing the look you want , tape your pattern pieces together at the seam line to create single pieces from multiple ones . <p> You can still sew darts , tucks , pleats , or gathers if you choose to , but the fewer of these bulky details you have , the easier your job will be . Darts are often necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have too many of them . Pleats and gathers can look nice , but be aware of how much extra bulk theyll add when sewing with two layers . <p> A dress with raglan sleeves , like the Colette Patterns Dahlia , will be easier to make reversible than one with set-in sleeves . <p> If you 're sewing a garment with sleeves , such as a jacket , top , or dress , look for alternatives to set-in sleeves , such as raglan , dolman sleeves , or kimono sleeves . These do n't  require the precise easing that set-in sleeves do , and are much simpler to make reversible . If you do choose a set-in sleeve , a low sleeve cap and a slightly dropped shoulder are easier to work with than a very fitted high cap sleeve . <p> You can also choose styles that have pockets . In-seam pockets that are sewn into a side seam can work well if you use the pillowcase method of construction ( see below ) . These pockets look similar for either side of the garment . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides before sewing the two layers together . <p> 02 Section <h> Choosing fabrics <p> Pick the right fabrics to keep your reversible garments smooth and wearable . <p> The next decision you will need to make is about fabric . Choosing the right fabric for a garment can be a challenge as it is . When making a reversible garment , you also must consider whether the fabrics will work together , both aesthetically and structurally . <p> Because reversible garments involve multiple layers of fabric , choosing light-to-medium weight fabrics will help you to avoid excess bulk . At the same time , picking fabrics that have some crispness ( or " body " ) to them will make sewing much easier . For the Osaka skirt , we like crisp cotton poplin , linen , light canvas , sateen , twill , or light wool . Silk twill can also work well . <p> Fabrics that have too much drape can sag over time , resulting in uneven , baggy hems . If you decide to sew a reversible garment in a drapey fabric , minimize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them or place them on a dress form overnight . Trim to even the layers before you hem . <p> Using similar weights and hands will usually yield the most surefire results . You could use the same fabric in different colors or prints , or just find fabrics that feel very similar to one another . The closer the fabrics are in feel , the fewer problems you 'll run into . <p> You can even make reversible knit garments , such as dresses , sweaters , or wraps . With knit fabrics in particular , its very important to choose two fabrics that work well together and are similar . Not only should they be about the same weight , they should also have approximately the same amount of stretch and recovery . Test this by stretching 10 inch swatches of each fabric . See if theyll stretch the same distance , and if they both return to the same size . Because recovery is so important in making reversible knit garments , its usually a good idea to look for knit fabrics that have some spandex content . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored , test it with your other fabrics to see if there will be any show-through . Often fabrics will seem to be opaque , but when a darker fabric is placed behind them , the color is transformed . If your fabric is n't completely opaque , you can underline it with a second layer to help prevent fabric and seams showing on one side . <p> Lay fabrics out next to one another to see how the colors and prints might work together in the final garment . <p> Finally , make sure the colors and prints you choose work together if theyll be seen together . On the Osaka skirt , up to four different fabrics can be used . Although the inner fabric is not as visible , it can still be seen at times peeking out from the edges of the wrap front . You do n't  have to stick to neutral colors or get too matchy-matchy , but consider how the various tones of your fabric look next to one another . <p> 03 Section <h> Seams , edges , and construction details <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garments . You can adapt a wide variety of styles to be reversible , but matching the method to the garment style is crucial . The first method is one I 'll call the layered method , a great method to choose for the most simple styles . The second method is one I call the pillowcase method , and this one can be used on garments that have more complex seams and details . <h> The layered method <p> To make a reversible garment with the layered method , cut two of each pattern piece , with one piece in each fabric . Baste or glue baste the matching pieces to one another , with wrong sides together . Sew the garment , using these two basted pieces as one , just like when you underline . <p> Flat felled seams look finished on both sides of a garment . <p> The trick for this method is that the seams must be sewn in such a way that they look good on both sides . The best option for this is a flat felled seam , which looks great from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they can be a little bulky , and they 're difficult to sew along tight curves . For this reason , its best to use the layered method on garments with minimal seams that are mostly straight or just slightly curved . <p> Other options for seams might be bound seams or French seams . Topstitch these seam edges flat to get a cleaner look . You can even bind seams in a contrasting color to emphasize the lines of the garment . <p> Edgestitch a French seam or bound seam flat to make it work on the reverse side . <p> This method does not work well if your garment has darts . If you have your heart set on a style with darts , try converting the darts into tucks , pleats , or gathers instead . These will provide the fullness of a dart , but will look good from either side . <p> The edges of reversible garments created this way can be finished cleanly with an edge binding . Use one of your fabrics to keep the binding inconspicuous on one side of the garment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse . Or , choose a binding color that blends with both sides . <p> The Osaka skirt is sewn using the pillowcase method , for a clean finish . <h> The pillowcase method <p> The second method is one I call the pillowcase method , because its very similar to sewing a pillow . Again , cut two of each pattern piece from each of your fabrics . Assemble each side of the reversible garment separately . Sew them together along all of the edges , with right sides together , leaving a gap along one edge . Turn the entire garment out through the opening , then close the gap with a hand slipstitch . <p> The advantage of this method is that all seam allowances and darts are neatly hidden between the two layers . This let 's you use patterns that have more details and shaping than the layered method , and it does n't  greatly alter the look of the garment . When using this method , its important to grade all seam allowances , and press the seams from each side in opposite directions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong side and pressed in opposite directions wherever possible . <p> Press all matching seams and darts in opposite directions , so there are fewer layers of bulk inside the garment . <p> 04 Section <h> Closures <p> Many garments need some form of closure to take on and off . Learn which ones work best and how to apply them . <p> Closing up reversible garments can be tricky , as traditional closures such as zippers are usually designed to work only from one side . There are some reversible zippers , but these are usually intended for bulky outerwear . <p> Buttons can also present a problem , since it can be difficult to fasten buttons from the inside , and the threads from attaching buttons can sometimes show . Use flat buttons that wo n't dig into your skin . If you 're sewing a shirt or a jacket , a blind placket can help conceal buttons or thread on either side . The Osaka skirt uses just two buttons , one on each side of the garment , so that only one button shows at a time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as the buttons are flat . <p> Snaps can be hidden easily between the layers of a placket or lap . <p> Snaps are another easy option for reversible garments , since they are normally hidden between layers . Try replacing button plackets with snaps when adapting a pattern . For the Osaka skirt , a single snap is placed along the wrap opening to keep the skirt closed in heavy wind or when sitting or standing . <p> Hooks and eyes are another alternative that can be concealed easily between layers . Or , sew garments such as tops and jackets so that the edges meet rather than overlap , and place hooks between layers . Add thread eyes to the other side along the opening . <h> How to sew reversiblehooks and thread eyes <h> Step 01 <p> Attach hooks to one layer of the opening , on the right side . <h> Step 01 <p> Place the second layer on top , right sides together , and stitch along the opening between the hooks . Turn to the right side . The hooks should protrude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite side . make thread eyes . Create a small loop of thread to correspond with the placement of each hook . Use a buttonhole stitch to reinforce the loop . <p> One final option is to add ties to close a garment . These work beautifully on wrapped garments , but they can also be incorporated into jackets , tops , and many other styles . You can even install small buckles , provided they wo n't feel annoying to wear on the inside . <p> Once you 've made these few decisions on style , fabric , construction , and closures , you 'll be ready to make all your clothing do double duty . Start with our Osaka pattern for an easy start that gives you nearly infinite options . 
@@36822497 @5822497/ <h> A Pressing Matter <p> Get to know your iron , the ultimate fabric shaper , by David Page Coffin <p> I reckon most sewists have heard that ironing is the side to side motion of the iron " and not to be done when sewing " while pressing is an up and down motion , and the only right way to handle the iron when sewing . <p> What 's the practical truth behind this seemingly over-fussy bit of sewing etiquette ? After all , every sewist has , at times , gotten away with ignoring these pronouncements , often with much improved efficiency . <p> At issue is the risk of distorting what 's being ironed . Yet what 's being left out is the irons power to precisely shape bits and pieces , and in ways that only skillful iron movement can provide . For example , a sewist can slightly favor one side of an edge seam over the other to hide the seamline . Or they can just press the seam allowances open in the first place , which requires very precise and minute arrangement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Finger pressing a seam . <p> Of course , this is often managed without an iron , by the so-called finger pressing method . But that only really gets the job done if you wriggle the layers between your fingers to fully separate them exactly at the seamline , and then burnish across them with a fingernail to make the creases so perhaps this should better be called finger-ironing ? And how is this done with an iron , if not with some subtle and precise sideways and forward movement of the tip as you slide it along the seam ? <p> It seems more useful to me to distinguish between ironing " that thing we do with laundry and finished clothing " and what we might reasonably call iron-work , those iron-moving skills we necessarily develop " or wish to develop . Moreover , its important to learn to get ever-better results when were applying an iron to our sewing . <p> This article is about iron-work and the complementary tools essential to getting the most from any iron . Let 's start with the iron itself by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be created when its moved across undefended fabric . <h> Exploration <p> It will serve you well to have a wider range of control over what you and your iron are doing than simply the choice between moving sideways or not . There 's no question you can stretch or distort fabric with an iron while you 're flattening , smoothing , and creasing with it . Occasionally , that 's exactly what you want to do , to one extent or another , when making sewn , or to-be-sewn , fabrics behave . To get the best results , you 'll want to spend some time playing with your iron to gain an understanding of " and control over " how you wield this important tool . <p> An iron sliding over fabric while held in the following positions : parallel to the movement ( top ) , perpendicular to the movement ( center ) , perpendicular to and tilted toward the movement ( bottom ) . Note the differences in distortion . <p> Here you can see the same piece of fabric being slid over with an iron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In each case , the iron and fabric both start from the same position and the full weight of the iron is on the fabric . As you can see , exactly how the iron is held or positioned has a dramatic impact on how much the fabric is both distorted and shifted toward the left . <p> I suggest trying out for yourself exactly what 's illustrated in these photos . You can use a cold iron , some simple fabrics you commonly sew with , and your usual pressing surface . Closely observe these and many other variations in iron position , tilt , and movement . Try changing the amount of weight you let the iron exert on the fabric . Experiment with moving with , across , and diagonal to the fabric grain . Then try the same with the heat turned on . <h> Some Questions to Ask Yourself As You Explore <p> As you get to know your personal range of options for manipulating fabric with your iron , here are some questions to consider : <p> What 's the maximum pressure , direction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create no permanent distortion when the iron is hot , and with each of your fabric types ? <p> Would a few well-placed pins , or just holding down the fabric with your free hand as you move the iron , significantly increase how much movement you can get away with ? <p> Do you notice a difference when you 're really paying attention to how the fabric moves underneath the iron ? Compared , say , to how ironing the laundry feels even if you 're a very careful ironer and have already observed much of this , does careful attention change how the iron affects your fabric ? <h> The Importance of Ironing Board Covers <p> How easily do your fabrics slide across your board ? A well-washed easily removable cotton , linen , or hemp ironing board cover with a slight texture , like drill cloth or canvas , will offer some resistance and is the best overall choice for an ironing board cover . Coated , metallized covers reflect heat back and reduce absorption , which throws off the recommended settings and advice . <h> Prepping Yardage <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you treat washed and dried yardage before cutting . There 's obviously a great temptation to iron these big rectangles as you would laundry , so that you can get the job done with reasonable speed . And so you can , once you 've calibrated your fabric prep touch and awareness , probably in some contrast to your normal laundry iron handling . <p> The impact of ironing on pre-cut fabric is most obvious with plaids . Slight distortions during the ironing process can visibly affect the grain in both directions . <p> A quick , careless sideways ironing can pull both grain directions of an unwashed cotton out of alignment . Imagine how much more likely it is that random , laundry-like ironing of a rumpled , just-dried length would result in plaids that are impossible to match . <p> As with every sort of craft , the path to better results is to become as regular and consistent in your movements as you can , whatever you 're doing . When prepping a fabric like this , carefully arrange each workable section in an exactly similar way on your padded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way and direction , and regularly check the pattern against some reference or ruler , to produce as uniform a result as you can expect . <p> This part of the clothes-making process is actually one of my favorites ; its when I really get to know and fall in love with " all over again and often in a whole new way " whichever of my stash gems I 'm about to sacrifice to the wardrobe . Its a lovely , calming , and centering way to bid bon voyage . <h> Essential Tools <h> A Minimal Toolkit <p> Consider a dry iron . Steam can be supplied with a spray bottle . <p> 1 . Iron with steam source . I have little hope ( or wish ) of encouraging anyone to give up their steam iron , but as dry irons are still available ( and vintage ones often still work perfectly ) , I do think they are worth considering , at least for sewing . For one , dry irons have no holes underneath to imprint or catch on the work . Indeed , moisture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely managed when you add it separately . Also , cleaning is much easier and there 's no maintenance . My Sunbeam works exactly the same now as when I got it 30 years ago , and back then it was already at least 30 years old . Note how the cord in the picture at the beginning of this section goes straight up ? That 's because I hook it through a loop hanging from the ceiling above my workspace and life is so much better . Try it ! <p> The key thing about steam is that it should be gone , the fabric completely dry , before the just-pressed work is moved . So , too much steam over too big an area is simply wasted time , plus it becomes a temptation to move things too soon . <p> 2 . Padded surface . A homemade rectangular flat padded surface , is perfect for almost all flat , right side construction iron work , including prepping short-ish yardage " and its easily portable . I can hardly remember where my ironing board is . <p> A padded surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( right ) . <p> 3 . Clapper . A clapper is perfect for adding pressure against drying fabric that does n't  need more heat . It can also be pressed against details that need a really hard crease . <p> 4 . A multi-shaped edge- and point-presser . This tool is used for opening seams . Note : clear unfinished hardwood ( no firs ) makes the ideal , tried and true hard pressing surface , so both your clapper and your edge- and point-presser should be made from one of these types of wood . <p> A tailor 's ham ( lower ) and pressing aid for long straight seams ( upper ) . <p> 5 . Tailor 's ham . A tailor 's ham is a tightly stuffed pillow that is used when pressing parts of a garment that must curve around body contours . The ham is used for any curved finishing , as at darts and hip-level side seams . <p> 6 . Pressing aid for long straight seams . This tool , a bit like half of a wooden dowel , is a convenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seams , as on pant legs and straight skirt seams . The curve means no imprints when pressed from either side . <p> The examples shown in this section cover just about any need . Keep these basics near your iron , and you will be equipped for most projects . And keep this rule of thumb in mind , one I found in a treasured old sewing book : <p> To avoid imprints of seams and edges , place the garment against a hard surface when pressing from the wrong side and against a thick and softly-padded surface when pressing from the right side . <h> Press Cloths <p> There are endless reasons why you might want to put something between your work and your iron , or underneath the work , or even both . Here are the substances I keep on hand and the main reasons why . <p> 1 . Wool . A thick , felty wool is perfect under any work that needs more padding than normal , such as details made from the same wool . You can consider this example as also representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric ) , which is often just the needed weight and texture . <p> 2 . Cotton drill . This is your default for mid to heavy fabrics . <p> Use heavy paper to create a pressing template for your fabric . To help your fashion fabric conform around a pressing template , a piece of cotton organdy is sometimes used . <p> 3 . Heavy paper . Heavy paper or thin art board is perfect for making pressing templates . You can use a piece of cotton organdy to help pull your fashion fabric around the template for a crisp line . <p> 4 . Regular-weight paper . Regular paper is an excellent , handy default paper to keep on hand . Since it does n't  stretch , it will do a much better job of keeping fabrics underneath from stretching sideways than a fabric press cloth . If it does n't  move , neither will the fabric underneath . <p> 5 . Tissue paper . As an alternative to regular paper , tissue paper is often just as good , somewhat transparent , and comes in bigger sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper is also perfect for keeping fusibles , adhesives , starch , and spray finishes from ever touching your pressing/ironing surfaces . You can also use packing paper to similar results . <p> All these but the Teflon can be completely or selectively pre-moistened for precision steaming . <h> Additional Tools <p> Here are a few other items I find indispensable . <p> 1 . Glue stick . A glue stick is such a great help , especially when pressing details into shape or when positioning such details in place for stitching down . Make sure to use one that is washable and acid-free . A tiny drop on the end of a pin can grab just the right amount and deliver it to the precise location . This is what I always do when forming , say , a placket point , pressed of course on my clapper for the sharpest creases , and when positioning it on the sleeve . I always apply a press to dry the glue , and using a pin allows you to drag under any stray threads at this time . <p> 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tape roller comes in handy when dealing with any materials that really do n't want heat ( leather , poly fleece , etc. ) , because it applies pressure without causing shifting . Pair this roller with a glue stick for handling those materials that do n't like heat . <p> Whenever a bunch of seams or edges are stacking up and just wo n't get flat enough , I always test out the application of a good whack with a serious , but soft-ish , mallet . The work should be well-supported underneath , of course ! Like , on the floor . A cloth on top can sometimes make a difference . <p> Well-pressed seams can elevate any project to a new level . More than that , your iron is one of many tools that can shape , form , and manipulate fabric to help you achieve your desired look .

@@36822500 @5822500/ <p> Many years ago , I was visiting Florence , Italy and stopped into a stationery shop . The tiny store was filled with creamy papers , handmade leather books , and beautiful fountain pens . On a table , I saw a small stack of notebooks with colorful marbled covers . Their swirling patterns were so intricate and dynamic , I could n't help but imagine them on clothing . <p> Marbling is a technique used to create these surface designs that resemble the patterns found in stone . Its been used for many years to create book covers and end papers , but its history and application go far beyond that . <p> The earliest known examples of marbling date back to Japan in the 12th century , where a technique known as suminagashi , meaning " floating ink " was used to create papers . Some scholars believe this artform was practiced even earlier in China , though no known examples exist . Suminagashi is still practiced in Japan today . <p> Similar methods also arose in central Asia in the 15th century . In Turkey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the designs were impossible to replicate exactly . This gave marbled papers a greater significance within the powerful Turkish empire , and the tradition remains strong in countries such as Iran and Turkey . <p> Finally , these methods spread from the middle east to Europe in the 17th century , where various countries each made their own adjustments and created signature patterns . This is the period in which marbled endpapers became popular in bookbinding , and you can still find these in use today . <p> Marbling has been used to create decorative papers and books for centuries . These papers were marbled by textile artist Natalie Stopka . <p> But marbling is no longer limited to these traditional applications . Today , its used to create artwork , fine papers , and fabric designs . Part of the beauty of marbling is that no two finished pieces are exactly alike , as the Turks discovered centuries ago . Textile artist Natalie Stopka , who creates marbled works and teaches workshops on large scale fabric marbling , says , " Marbling is a very expressive art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the artist interacts with a fluid medium , revealing their temperament . Whether you are a fastidious craftsperson or relish experimentation , the marbling process will manifest your hand and aesthetic . " <p> 01 Section <h> Getting Started <p> Marbling at home requires just a few special tools and supplies . Get set up with the basics before beginning to experiment . <p> Despite the intricate results , the practice of marbling is simple at its core . Paints are floated on top of a gelatinous solution thick enough to allow them to remain on the surface . The craftsperson then creates patterns in the paint by raking through with simple utensils . Finally , a pretreated piece of cloth is lowered onto the surface , removed , rinsed , and set . <h> Choosing your project <p> For the beginner , its best to start with small pieces of fabric . As you will see , marbling large pieces requires a great deal of workspace and the construction of large frames , whereas small pieces can be marbled in kitchen tubs or pans . This makes marbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk bras and panties , but you can also use it on pillows , kerchiefs , bias tape trims , or small insets or pieces in larger garments . For example , you could use marbling on the yoke of a shirt , the placket of a blouse , or anywhere else a small pattern piece is used . <p> Try marbling small pieces for projects such as intimates , small bags , handkerchiefs , or napkins . These marbled silk ribbons were created by artist Natalie Stopka . Use any leftover scraps to make your own ribbon or bias tape . <h> The frame <p> You will need a frame to hold the medium ( also known as " size " ) , and it must be large enough to accommodate your fabric piece with at least an inch of room on all sides . For small pieces , you can use an inexpensive cake or lasagna pan from the grocery store , or a larger dish pan . This is what we will cover in this demonstration , since they are easy to find and perfect for beginner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and provide more surface tension , so paints float more easily . <p> Once you 've developed greater skills and want to branch out into larger projects , you can construct your own frame for marbling using 1 inch by 4 inch framing wood of any length you 'd like . Create a large rectangle and use metal angle brackets at the corners to secure the shape . Finally , line the bottom and sides with clear plastic to hold the medium and paint . The plastic keeps the paint and medium from seeping out , without requiring you to build a bottom for your frame , which makes it heavier and harder to store . <h> Marbling pattern tools <p> Collect wide toothed combs , chopsticks , whisks , and old forks . Or make your own marbling comb from skewers taped to apiece of cardboard . <p> In addition to the frame , you 'll need tools to create the designs on the surface . The most common readymade implements are wide-tooth combs , forks , or chopsticks . These are all easy to find and make sense to start with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marbling , and these extend almost to the edges of the frame , allowing you to create even designs . You can easily create your own marbling comb using toothpicks or skewers pushed through a piece of sturdy foam , or taped securely to a piece of cardboard . You could also force heavy pins through a piece of cardboard . Just make sure the tines of your comb are evenly spaced , and that the total length is at least 1 to 2 inches shorter than the frame . <h> Paint mixing and dropping tools <p> You will also need a few simple tools for mixing up the paint , thinning it as needed , and dropping it onto the surface of the medium . Small plastic paint mixing cups with lids work fine and allow you to see the colors easily . You can also use disposable cups if you like , or other small cups dedicated to paint . <p> For dropping the paint , I prefer an eyedropper . Eyedroppers allow you to release small quantites of paint at a time into the medium , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much paint at once , or from too great a height , will keep it from floating on the surface where it comes into contact with the fabric . <h> Medium <p> Many sorts of medium ( also known as " size " ) are available for home marbling . The job of this substance is to provide a thick , gelatinous , but still aqueous surface for the paint to sit on . Some home marblers have even used watered down wallpaper paste ! The amount of medium you need will depend on the size of your frame . You want enough medium to fill the frame 1 to 2 inches deep . You can easily determine how much you need by pouring water into the frame until it reaches this depth , then measuring the water as you pour it out . <p> The most popular option for medium is carrageen , a non-toxic thickener made from seaweed . There are two types of carrageen : blender carrageen and heated carrageen . Both should be prepared 12-24 hours before use , to allow time to thicken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whereas heated carrageen is useful for large quantities . <p> Blender carrageen is easy to make and non-toxic . <p> To prepare blender carrageen , place water in your blender and begin blending . With the blender running , add 1 teaspoon or carrageen for every 2 cups of water . Make the medium in batches if necessary . Blend for about 30 seconds . You should have a thick , uniform consistency . Place the substance in the refrigerator overnight , and remove and allow to come to room termperature before using . <p> For heated carrageen , use a gallon of water . Pour 4 cups of this into a pot and heat to a simmer . Pour into a bucket and add 5 tablespoons of the carrageen powder along with a little more water to cool the mixture enough to immerse your hands . Mix thoroughly with a stick , or use your hands to break up any clumps . Stir in the rest of the water , and refrigerate overnight . Again , allow the mixture to come to room temperature before using . <p> Methocel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that it can be mixed just 30 minutes before you begin , so there is no need to let it sit overnight . To create this medium , place a gallon of warm water in a bucket , then add 1 Tablespoon of ammonia . Finally , stir in 1/4 cup of methocel , a little at a time , stirring constantly with a large stick or a whisk . Once dissolved , let the medium sit for 30 minutes . <h> Fabric <p> Many types of fabric can be used for marbling , but for best results , use a fabric with a smooth texture and fine weave . Heavily textured fabrics will not show the patterns quite as well . <p> Experiment with different fibers to see what works best with your paints . Silk is always a great choice because it absorbs color well and often has a luxuriously smooth , fine texture . For the Florence bralette and Geneva panties , we used a silk/spandex charmeuse , also known as stretch silk . Linen , cotton , and other fibers can also be used , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use up the scraps you 've been saving . <h> Alum <p> Alum will help the color from the paint set on the fabric , preventing them from bleeding out later . Begin by pre-washing the fabric with detergent , preferably an industrial textile detergent such as synthrapol . This will remove any manufacturing chemicals , dirt , or oil before you begin . Its best to do this 12-24 hours before you marble , so do it at the same time that you create the medium . <p> Dissolve alum in hot water , at a ratio of 3 tablespoons per quart . Allow the mixture to come back to room temperature . Swirl the fabric in the mixture , allowing it to become saturated , and then remove it quickly . Squeeze to remove excess water and hang dry . Do n't  apply heat after treating with alum until you rinse it out later , as this can damage the fabric . Line drying helps prevent wrinkles from forming . <h> Paint <p> You can mix a variety of colors from red , yellow , blue , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most common choices for fabric marbling . Acrylic paints can be purchased from any art supply or craft store , but its best to be consistent with the brand so that they mix well and have similar viscosity . <p> Airbrush inks create gorgeous colors that work well on many fabrics , though they sometimes must be mail ordered . For this demonstration , I used Jacquard airbrush inks . <p> You do not need many colors to begin , since the paints can be mixed . Red , yellow , and blue will allow you to create a large range of colors from these primary hues . You may also wish to purchase black and white . These few colors should get you started . <p> Depending on the type of paint you use , you may need to dilute them a bit to allow them to float on the surface . Test a bit first on your medium before you begin , gently placing one drop of paint on the surface . If it seems to sink to the bottom , start thinning the paint . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dispersant to the paint and mix . Try adding it to the medium again . Repeat until the paint floats easily on the surface , but still remains in a roughly circular shape . <p> 02 Section <h> How to marble silk <p> Now that you have all the supplies and basics down , let 's walk through a single marbling project together . Well dye a piece of silk charmeuse that can be used for creating the Florence bralette cups and Geneva panties. 185427 @qwx385427 <p> One piece of silk <p> Alum <p> One plastic bucket for pre-treating fabric <p> One large rectangular dishpan to use as a frame <p> Carrageen ( blender type ) <p> Jacquard airbrush inks <p> Eyedroppers <p> Small paint mixing cups <p> A large comb , chopsticks , and/or homemade marbling comb ( see above ) <p> Experiment with colors and patterns on small pieces of fabric , then pick your favorites to make into projects . <p> Want to keep it simple ?

All you need to add are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eyedroppers . <h> Step 01 <p> 12 to 24 hours before marbling , prepare the medium using the blender method ( see instructions above , under " Medium " ) . The mixture will be foamy at first . Rest in the refrigerator overnight to allow air to come to the surface . <h> Step 02 <p> At the same time , pre-wash and pre-treat your fabric using alum ( see instructions above , under " Alum " ) . Allow to dry while your medium rests . <h> Step 03 <p> About one hour before marbling , remove the medium from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature . <h> Step 04 <p> Mix your paint colors . Add a few drops to the medium and check to see if they float , yet remain consistent in the medium . If not , adjust the paint by thinning it with water or dispersant . Continue adding paint , drop by drop . <h> Step 05 <p> Using tools such as a wide comb , fork , or chopsticks , drag lightly through the surface to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other pattern you 'd like . <h> Step 06 <p> Lay your piece of fabric on the surface , allowing the middle of the fabric to contact the solution first , then lower the edges . It can be helpful to have a friend help , to keep the fabric from falling , but this is n't strictly necessary for small pieces . <h> Step 07 <p> Lift the fabric out of the water , gently peeling it away from the surface . The remaining paint can be scooped from the surface of the medium with strips of newspaper , allowing you to marble the next piece . <h> Step 08 <p> Rinse the fabric in cool water , being careful not to wring or twist the fabric . Line dry , or lay flat . Once dry , iron the fabric to heat set the design and prevent future bleeding . <p> Your fabric can now be used to create beautiful garments , crafts , or home decor .

@@36822504 @5822504/ <h> Strong and Pretty Pockets <p> It seems everyone loves a couple pockets in their clothing , whether it 's deep patch pockets on a coat capable of holding your keys and wallet or small in-seam pockets on a skirt that give you a place to put your hands . <p> But the edges of pockets are stress points . The joining of seams coupled with all that movement of your hands moving in and out can lead to excessive tugging , fraying , and stitch breakage . Without reinforcement , you may find that the edges of pockets are the first part of a piece of clothing to look worn out . <p> To see how this issue is prevented in manufactured clothing , look at your favorite pair of jeans . In addition to rivets that help hold things together , you 'll notice pocket edges are reinforced with a row of strong stitches known as a bar tack . This small area of stitching keeps pockets from separating or tearing as they 're used over time . Though this is usually accomplished in factories with a specialized attachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a zigzag stitch ( see below ) . <p> Jeans and other workwear are generously reinforced with bar tacks . <p> But the traditional bar tack is only one method of holding your pocket in place . Though it works extremely well and certainly suits hardwearing workwear like jeans , there are also fun , decorative alternatives . Some of these can be created quickly and easily on a sewing machine , while others are embroidered by hand . Choose the method that works with the style of garment you 're making . <p> These reinforcing stitches can also be used in other high-stress areas that are prone to coming apart over time . They are particularly suitable for areas that you either tie off or backstitch to secure , such as the ends of darts , tucks , or pleats . Adding a reinforcing stitch gives these areas even more security and increases your stitching 's longevity . <h> Machine reinforcement <p> Use your sewing machine to quickly and easily add extra security to your pockets , whether with a traditional bar tack or a more decorative option . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Bar tack <p> The bar tack is the most common method of reinforcing a pocket edge . To sew a bar tack , set your machine to a zigzag stitch with a length of 0.2mm and a width of 3-3.5mm . Stitch a short row to secure , then backstitch one to two times over the entire row to secure . The bar tack can also be sewn diagonally at any corner . <p> Pivot three times to stitch a triangular reinforcement . <h> Triangle stitching <p> Small triangles are easy and quick to sew . They 're often found at the top of patch pockets or flaps , but they can also be used anywhere reinforcement is needed . <p> Sew a few stitches , sink your needle into the fabric , and pivot . Sew a few more stitches , pivot again , and sew the remaining side of the triangle . Pivot once more , sewing over the first set of stitches to fully secure the triangle in place . <p> Form an X with two rows of stitching for an unusual look . <h> X stitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pocket edge is with an X stitch . Sew one 45-degree row of stitches , backstitching at each end to secure . Lift and sew the second row in the same way , at 90 degrees to the first . <p> Tiny X stitches can reinforce seams at the top and bottom of in-seam pockets . Larger X stitches are well-suited to stitching down and reinforcing large pleats , such as a kick pleat in a skirt . <h> Decorative stitches <p> In addition to the simple shapes commonly seen in tailored or workwear garments , your sewing machine may also be capable of producing decorative stitches that work well for reinforcement . This short row of triangles was created with the built-in stitch settings on a Bernina sewing machine .

@@36822507 @5822507/ <h> A Guide to Drawstrings <p> A simple detail that offers a range of design possibilities . <p> Drawstrings get a bad rap . They bring to mind sweat pants , hoodies , and pajamas . Do n't  get me wrong " these are some of the best clothing items , but they do n't  necessarily offer style and sophistication . This does not have to be the case ; like most things it all boils down to the application and the context . A well executed drawstring can look effortless , cool , and casual . Garments like the Nantucket shorts give you the opportunity to create stylish drawstring garments that are anything but sloppy . <h> The Basics <p> Let 's first take a look at the anatomy of a basic drawstring closure . <p> The casing : this is the channel through which the drawstring ( and sometimes elastic too ! ) passes . This can either be constructed similarly to a hem , or it can be a separate piece that is sewn onto the garment . <p> The eyelet : This is the outlet through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening can be created by buttonholes , eyelets , or grommets . <p> The drawstring : This is the cord ribbon or fabric strung through the casing and the opening that cinches the garment securely into place . <h> Eyelets <h> Buttonhole <p> Because it is so easy , this is the most common technique used by home sewist when creating drawstrings . After setting your sewing machine up with thread that matches your project , all you need to do is attach your buttonhole foot and go . This finish can look professional and neat if you keep a few things in mind . <p> Test your buttonhole on a scrap of fabric before you stitch the real deal . Check for size , along with appropriate width and length of your buttonhole stitch . Stitches should be dense but not rigid or bulky . <p> Match the size of the buttonhole to the drawstring being used . The buttonhole should be no more than 1/8 " larger than the drawstring passing through it . <p> Use a tear away stabilizer under your self fabric as you sew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Using matching thread ! This seems obvious but with the dense nature of a buttonhole stitch , if you are even a couple shades off , the results can be less than ideal . <h> Grommet and Metal Eyelets <p> Grommets and eyelets are an excellent option for professional looking drawstrings . Hardware is often an under utilized detail in the home sewing world . There is no need to shy away from grommets and eyelets ! They are easy to install and are an added element of interest to otherwise simple projects like the Nantucket shorts or the Seabrook bag . 185427 @qwx385427 <p> Grommets or eyelets <p> The setting anvil and stud setter in corresponding size <p> Hard surface <p> Mallet <p> I have seen many variations that make eyelets and grommets different from one another . Some would say that an eyelet is only composed of one piece , while a grommet has two pieces a flange ( or washer ) and a barrel ( the right side of the grommet ) . This is not exclusively true . Some brands of eyelets , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces and are installed just like grommets . Typically eyelets are smaller and therefore less strong . <p> Grommets and eyelets are typically made up of two pieces of hardware that are interlocked when pressure is applied by way of anvil . The piece that lays on the right side of the fabric is the barrel . The smooth beveled side sits on the right side of the project , while the post is the metal tube that connects to the back side of the grommet . The wrong side of the grommet is called the flange , and looks like a washer . Eyelets and grommets available for home sewers are set with an anvil and stud setter . <h> 6 Step Easy Installation <h> Step 01 <p> Reinforce the area where the grommet is being installed with a small piece of fusible interfacing . <h> Step 02 <p> To install mark the placement of the grommet by tracing the inside of the post onto the fabric . <h> Step 03 <p> Use a small pair of scissors to cut away this circle . <h> Step 04 <p> Insert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barrel should be on the right side of the fabric . <h> Step 05 <p> Place the flange convex side up over the barrel on the wrong side of the fabric . <h> Step 06 <p> Place barrel side down onto the anvil . The anvil should be resting on a very hard surface . <h> Step 07 <p> Place barrel side down onto the anvil . The anvil should be resting on a very hard surface . <h> Tips <p> Alway buy extra grommets . I generally find that if I purchase extra I will not need them , but if I do n't  there will be tears and frantic trips to the fabric store . <p> Set aside a large swatch of your fashion fabric when cutting to test your grommets or eyelet . <p> If your fabric is light weight and interfacing is not enough reinforcement , try using a small piece of wool felt to add body . <p> To protect the finish on novelty grommets and eyelets , place a piece of fabric between the anvil and barrel . <h> The Drawstring <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this class students made a pair of drawstring pajamas with a self made drawstring . As the end of the class approached I realized that I would have time to demonstrate making the matching drawstring , but not enough time to execute them . I suggested that everyone picked out a cute ribbon or twill tape to use instead . <p> I was afraid everyone would be disappointed . On the contrary , people were so excited with their cool contrasting drawstrings . Every time I taught the class from then on I gave people the option of either method , and 9 times out of 10 people opted for the fancy contrast option . <h> Elastic <p> Adding elastic to your casing can be a practical choice even when applying a drawstring . The elastic will lend stability , while also allowing you to tie your drawstring more loosely , without the fear of a wardrobe malfunction . <p> I have fairly simple taste , I like a lot of chambray , denim , and black , so I always like to infuse small details into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking garments . Check the notions section at your local fabric store for trims that can be used as drawstrings , you may be surprised what you turn up . <h> Cording <p> Try using cording , most fabric stores carry this basic notion in a natural color . Left as is this can be a casual element that lends a nautical vibe . Cording can also be dyed to create a custom touch to your project . I love that this particular material is so sturdy , making it the perfect option for projects like the Seabrook bag . <h> Twill Tape or Ribbon <p> More and more shops are carrying a rainbow of twill tape . I have been stocking up my stash with pretty colors that would be stunning used as a drawstring . Grosgrain or other ribbons can also add a more feminine touch to a garment . To ensure that your project maintains a professional and clean quality , finish the ends of the twill tape or ribbon with a small hem . This will prevent fraying and and ensure that your project will hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I love this method because all you need are some sizable scraps .

This is a great design detail but also prevents slipping during the wash cycle . <p> Knots : Get out your boy scout handbook and get creative with knots . A simple overhand knot can be appropriate for a more minimal look and will keep your drawstrings in place , but it is n't your only option . Try a figure 8 knot or a more elaborate decorative knot . <p> Reconsider drawstrings . When a little special attention is applied , they can be a lovely detail that looks as thoughtful as it does pulled together . Try sewing up the Nantucket shorts or the Seabrook bag , mix things up by using eyelets or using an unexpected trim as the drawstring . Remember the best thing about sewing is that you can bend the rules and make something that is unique to you . 185425 @qwx385425 <p> Haley Glenn is a staff writer for Seamwork .

What 's more , it does n't  need to be relegated to the hem ; you can use hemstitching nearly anywhere to create a vintage touch . <h> A brief history of hemstitching <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorative hems . To create the look , individual threads were pulled out from the fabric along the warp or the weft , leaving small gaps in the fabric . The remaining threads that transversed these gaps were then embroidered by hand with needle and thread to create a wide variety of decorative patterns . Because hemstitching involves removing threads from fabric , it falls under a category of needlework known as drawn threadwork . <p> Because creating the gaps requires pulling threads in this way , hand hemstitching can only be done along the grainlines of a fabric . This is why you 'll see it most commonly adorning rectangular items such as napkins or pillowcases , or along straight hems such as the bottom of a vintage slip . <p> To create hand hemstitching , individual threads are pulled from the fabric . <p> Like other forms of hand needlework , this type of hemstitching was labor intensive to produce .

It looks beautiful stitched along the edges of collars or the top of a shirt or patch pocket . <p> Hemstitching looks great on linen , cotton , and silk fabrics with an even weave . This Savannah camisole was made in a plain linen . <h> Fabrics <p> Hemstitching can work on a wide variety of fabrics , but its a natural fit for linen , cotton , and silk . When you apply hemstitching along the grainline of fabrics with larger threads and an even weave , you can emphasize the openness of the stitches by removing individual threads before you stitch , just like you would in hand hemstitching . <p> Spray starch , spray stabilizer , or tear-away interfacing can be used to make even stitching easier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you begin hemstitching . This is because hemstitching uses large needles , which can potentially push the fabric down below the throat plate or cause puckers . The finer your fabric , the more necessary it is to add extra stability to keep your stitches neat . <p> Apply spray starch or spray fabric stabilizer to your fabric before stitching . This will add a papery stiffness to light fabrics , and can be washed away when you are finished .

If you do n't  have access to a wing needle , you can even use a large size universal needle , such as a 100/16 for very light fabrics such as silk , or 120/19 for heavier fabrics such as thick linen . <p> For thread , try a 60 weight cotton embroidery thread , or rayon or silk decorative thread .

Before you begin stitching your garment , try a test run on a scrap of the same fabric to check the stitch formation . If you 've stabilized your fabric and still notice puckers , try holding the fabric slightly taut as you stitch . Loosen the tension of your needle to see if that helps . Finally , try shortening the stitch in both length and width . <p> 02 Section <h> Hemstitching with a Single Wing Needle <p> Using a single wing needle allows you to create a wide variety of hemstitched looks by changing up the stitches . <p> These designs were created with a single needle technique . 185427 @qwx385427 <p> Marking pen , pencil , or chalk <p> Ruler <p> A single wing needle , size 100 or 110 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spray starch or tear-away stabilizer <h> Stitches to try <p> Sewing hemstitching with a single wing needle gives you the freedom to use any number of decorative stitches . Experiment with the stitches that come with your own machine , or try these beautiful options : <p> 1 . Pin stitch : This is the most traditional option , and works well for sewing down hems or other edges . Use a length and width of 2mm . A picot stitch will give a similar look . <p> 2 . Venetian stitch : Another traditional stitch , similar to an entredeaux stitch . Use a width of 3.5mm and a length of 2.5mm . <p> 3 . Daisy stitch : A simple star-shaped stitch . <p> 4 . Zigzag stitch : The simplest option , and one that 's available on most machines . Use a length of 3mm and a width of 2mm . <p> 5 .

Press the hem into place , then sew hemstitching using any of the two techniques outlined above . Sew the hemstitching from the right side of the fabric . <p> Once sewn , use small shears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underside of the hem . The hemstitching will simultaneously finish your edge and attach the hem in place . Give it a final press . <p> For a single fold hem , stitch in place and then trim away excess from the back . <p> For a double fold hem , use a blind hem foot and a pin stitch or picot stitch . <h> Double fold hem <p> In sewing a double fold hem , you will secure a folded edge to your fabric . To do this , the stitching must be much more precise than with a single hem , since you can not simply cut away the excess fabric . <p> Use a blind hem foot to guide your stitching , and set your machine to the pin stitch or picot stitch . Use a single wing needle . Stitch along the folded edge from the wrong side of the fabric so that the straight portion of the stitch goes through only the outer layer of fabric , and the horizontal part of the stitch stitches into the fold of the hem .

@@36822526 @5822526/ <h> How to sew a v-neck t-shirt <p> We show you how to sew this classic neckline " and how to draft your own . <p> V-necks are one of the most flattering necklines out there . Formed by two straight edges that meet in a point below your chin , the v-neck draws the eye toward your face ( provided its not very low , in which case the eye might be drawn elsewhere ! ) . <p> According to stylist and blogger Sally McGraw , v-necks tend to make the face look slimmer . " The v-shaped opening becomes an illusory reflection of your facial shape : Even if your face is oval or triangular or square , the eye sees a heart shape when a v of colored fabric is placed directly below , " she says . V-necks also tend to elongate the body , making them one of the most popular necklines for women of all body types . <p> If you 've avoided sewing v-necks in t-shirts or other knits because of the seemingly difficult construction , we have a few tricks to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t-shirts and sweaters might take an extra step or two , but they 're nearly as easy as any other banded neckline . If you 've got a pattern for a shirt with a less-than-flattering neckline , well show you how to swap a v-neck in by drafting a new neckband . <p> 01 Section <h> How to sew a v-neckband <p> A clean , finished v-neck is simple to sew once you know this secret . <p> Most t-shirts have a band around the neckline . <p> Bands are simply folded strips of knit fabric sewn to the neck opening , with the seam on the wrong side . <p> Most t-shirts and other knit tops are finished with a band at the neck . These bands are relatively easy to sew . A strip of knit fabric is folded in half lengthwise to create the band . This band is then sewed to the neck opening , and the neck seam is turned to the inside . These bands can either be sewn in the round , or a seam such as the shoulder or back seam can be left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seam then closes the band . <p> V-necks are a little different . There is a sharp corner right at the center front , which requires the band to form a mitered corner . Theoretically , if your shirt has a center front seam , you could make that your final seam , closing up the band along with the center front seam . But this is not the tidiest option , since it leaves a small seam in the band in the most obvious spot , the center of the neckline . Plus , do you really want a seam down the front of your t-shirt ? <p> A cleaner solution is to sew the v-corner before installing the band , as we 've done on the Aberdeen top . here 's how to sew it , step by step . <h> Step 01 <p> Place the two neckband pieces with the right sides together . <h> Step 02 <p> Fold the pieces lengthwise , matching the raw edges . <h> Step 03 <p> Stitch along the slanted short edge , using a serger or a stretch stitch on your sewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a straight stitch will work here , as the seam will not need much elasticity . <h> Step 04 <p> Open the neckband up and fold along the seamline with the wrong sides together . You should now see a v-shape at the center front . <h> Step 05 <p> Finger press the seam flat and baste along the bottom raw edge of the v-shape to hold the band in place . <h> Step 06 <p> Stitch the band to the neckline . Begin at the center back and stitch to the center front . Remove the work , turn , and sew the other side from center front to center back . <h> Step 07 <p> Stitch the remainder of the neckband into the neckline . If the neckband is one piece , it can be sewn in the round . If it is two pieces , close the center back of the neckband along with the center back seam . <p> 02 Section <h> Draft your own v-neck <p> Create your own band for a v-neck to transform scoop necks , crew necks , and more . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightweight sweater knit . <p> If you have a pattern you 'd like to change into a v-neck , drafting the neckline band is easy . You can create that divot at just the right angle to keep your neckline lying flat and looking good . For this example , well create two separate pieces for the band that meet at the center back seam , but this can also be adapted to sew the neckline in the round . <h> Step 01 <p> Draw the v-neck shape that youd like on your front pattern piece . Make it as high or as low as you 'd like . Also draw in the seam allowance on the shoulder seam . <h> Step 02 <p> On your pattern , measure the length of the front and back neckline , minus the seam allowance at the shoulder seam . Add about 1 inch to this number to allow room for trimming the center front . This is measurement A. <h> Prevent gaping <p> If you 've sewed rounded knit necklines , you know that the neckband is often cut a little smaller than the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inner curve . While a v-neck does not have the dramatic curve of a round neckline , it can sometimes gape around the shoulders . To prevent this , cut the neckband about 1/2 inch shorter on each side and stretch to fit around the shoulder seam . <h> Step 03 <p> Decide how wide you would like your band to be . Double this number . Multiply your seam allowance by two and add this to the width . This is measurement B. Using a ruler , draw a rectangle with measurement A as the length and measurement B as the width . <h> Step 04 <p> Fold the band pattern piece in half lengthwise . Measure and mark the seam allowance along the long raw edge . Mark the seam allowance along the front neckline as well . Walk the band piece along the neckline , with the fold facing up . <h> Step 05 <p> Using a ruler , draw a line extending the center front of the top straight up across the band . <h> Step 06 <p> Measure and mark an additional seam allowance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess beyond the seam allowance . <h> Step 08 <p> Open the pattern piece up . You should now have a divot at the center front of the band .

@@36822529 @5822529/ <h> An Unfinished Hem : Three Ways <p> An intentionally raw hem can be a lovely stylized choice for finishing your garments . Use this technique to highlight the casual nature of a garment or to dress down a more formal fabric choice . Though an unfinished edge can be charming , a uniform look is what keeps this detail looking neat and intentional . <p> When making this design decision , it is important to take a few things into consideration : <p> Does the fabric have a high tendency to unravel ? For example , controlling the fraying of synthetics can be challenging . <p> How does the fabric look when unraveled ? <p> Is the hem straight or curved ? If the hem is curved it may fray irregularly . <h> Method One : Raw Edge with a Single Needle Straight Stitch <p> This technique is best used on straight hems , as the consistent grain line will allow the fabric to unravel evenly . A straight stitch located right above the cut hem ensures that the edge will only unravel up to a certain point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as only the warp threads are exposed during the fraying process . <p> Make sure the garment hem is cut to the desired length , as this will be the finished garment length . &lt; <h> Step 01 <p> Set up your sewing machine for a standard straight stitch . The seam allowance used will directly affect the amount the garment will unravel . Use a larger seam allowance for more fringe and a smaller seam allowance for less fringe . <h> Step 02 <p> Begin stitching at the garment side seam or another less visible location on the garment . Stitch around hem at the desired seam allowance , and when you arrive back to your starting point , backstitch to finish . Trim threads . <p> Tip : If the fabric being used unravels at a high rate , try using a zigzag stitch instead . A zigzag stitch grips a broader surface area of the fabric , helping to better control fraying . <p> This method of creating an unfinished hem is an excellent option for garments with curved hems . The use of bias tape allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use store-bought bias tape or make your own .

Trim the seam allowance and press open . <h> Step 02 <p> Pin the right side of bias tape to the right side of garment hem . Using a straight stitch , sew with a 3/8 " seam allowance . Finish the seam with your preferred finishing method . <h> Method Three : Turned Bias Tape with Unfinished Edge <h> How to Determine Dimensions <p> Length = Length of hem + the number calculated for the bias tape widthExample : If the hem circumference is 45 " , the equation would be 45 + 1 = 46 <p> This hem uses a similar technique in the previous method but would be better suited for lighter fabrics or fabric that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and then stitched down in this technique , offering more control over how much the fabric will fray . <p> Make sure the garment hem is cut to the desired length , as this will be the finished garment length . <h> Step 01 <p> If making bias tape , begin by cutting bias strips .

Our small 100-year-old yellow cottage needed some work , and I was excited to buy paint , tear out the carpet , and get to work . But the part I was most excited about was the garden . I had fantasies of a lush , productive landscape with plenty of fruit trees , a cutting garden , raised beds for vegetables , and shady spots for dining outdoors with friends . <p> When I get excited about something , I tend to nerd out on all the details . I devoured gardening books . I learned about soil amendments and crop rotation . I figured out how to start seeds in my basement . I built my own compost bin . I poured through seed catalogs and made checklists and logged my plants progress . <p> All of this attention to detail taught me a lot about raising healthy plants , but it did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden is more than a bunch of plants , no matter how pretty or productive they are . A garden , at its best , is a living and breathing environment where all the elements work together . It reflects the person who creates it : their personality , their lifestyle , and the love they put into it . <p> In that way , creating a garden is like creating a wardrobe . First , you have to understand yourself and your own style and tastes . Do you prefer formal or informal ? Do you value functionality or beauty more ? Do you like things a little messy and wild , or contained and sleek ? <p> Like a garden , a wardrobe needs certain elements to really come together . A garden needs structure , in the form of beds and paths , benches and tables . It needs focal points " the big , showy plants that capture your attention . And then it needs all the other plants that fill in the gaps and work together to create a cohesive look through color and style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " uniforms " you wear . Focal points might come from your show-stopping statement pieces . And then there are all the functional and useful everyday pieces that work with your life and form the true building blocks of your daily outfits . <p> Its been five years now since we moved into our little house , and while our yard has definitely developed along the way , the changes have mostly been small and incremental . Although changing a garden or a wardrobe can sometimes involve a drastic overhaul , most of the time its more a matter of working with what you have and making meaningful , thoughtful changes over time . <p> The Kenedy dress is easy to wear and works in nearly any spring fabric . <p> Just like with a garden , spring is the perfect time to plan these changes . Everything is reemerging , and we start dreaming of all that we 've been lacking for months : bright flowers , warm weather , light fabrics , and soft colors . These are the things that filled our thoughts as we developed this months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new dresses this month , suitable for dressing up for your next warm weather event , or layering with cardigans for an everyday look . The Kenedy dress is a soft trapeze shape and has a beautiful V-shaped back neckline with a pretty tie detail .

The Catarina is a spaghetti-strap dress with no closures to sew and a softly gathered Grecian silhouette . Try it out in rayon challis for a dress that is light , cool , and unfussy . <p> These versatile , pretty pieces just might be the next step toward that spring wardrobe you 've been dreaming about over winter .

Use this thread for the top of your stitching , with polyester all purpose thread in the bobbin . <h> Prevent sticking <p> If you find that your leather or vinyl fabric is sticking to your machine as you sew , try a teflon-coated foot or a rolling foot . Though some sewists use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sometimes slightly damage the surface texture . Test this on a scrap before proceeding . <p> If you do n't  own either of these presser feet , try sliding tissue paper between the material and your machine . It will prevent the surface from sticking , and can be torn away when the seam is finished . <h> Heat testing <p> If you plan to use an iron , test the heat on scraps before beginning . Set your iron to the synthetic setting or slightly hotter , and turn off steam . Cut small swatches and apply heat for increasing lengths of time to check for damage . Fold pieces and try pressing the folds flat to check for cracking . <p> Always use a press cloth when pressing vinyl or leather . <h> Applying pressure for flat seams <p> Use a clapper to apply pressure to seams rather than using excessive heat .

Customize your bag by swapping in some of these hardware touches . <h> Straps <p> Though you can make your own straps , purchased bag straps can save you time and look highly polished . Purchased straps often have pre-punctured holes , making them easy to attach with a heavy thread . <h> Eyelets and grommets <p> Grommets or eyelets can be used as reinforcement in a similar way to rivets , or they can be used to thread straps or chains through your bag . Grommet setting kits and tools are available at most major fabric stores . <h> Magnetic snaps <h> Turn locks <p> Turn locks have a luxurious , classic , and feminine appearance but they 're actually no more difficult to install than snaps .

She insisted I watch the film , proclaiming that it was vital to me becoming a well-rounded woman . I was , like most girls on the edge of adolescence , skeptical at best . <p> For those of you who have never had the extreme joy of watching 9 to 5 , it is a story about three women who become unlikely friends and allies as they bond over their mutual hatred for their boss .

These changes ultimately improve the business and the lives of the people who work there .

These different styles may reflect the personalities of each woman but in no way do they reflect their individual ability to get the job done . <p> When I think of power dressing , I think of being empowered to wear what makes me feel good , not what is in vogue , not what the shelves at a trendy megastore have to offer , but what inspires joy in me . <p> Office wear generally dictates that we blend , and there have certainly been times in my life where I felt inspired to do exactly that .

I sewed with eye-searingly-bright rayon jacquard , I reached further into my closet for the me-made dresses I had n't  worn for a year , and wore my favorite denim jacket on as many occasions as possible .

Just like many women before me , I had discovered the power of the little black dress . <p> It is hard to nail down exactly why the LBD is so damn awesome .

@@36822569 @5822569/ <h> 3 ways to paint a bag <p> Create a customized bag by painting on leather and faux leather . Use any of these three methods to make a bag that 's completely unique . <p> Painting on leather or faux leather is an easy way to completely transform the look of a simple bag . All you need are inexpensive leather paints and a paintbrush to get started creating something unusually lovely . You do n't  even need any particular artistic skill to create beautiful geometric or abstract patterns , though you can also use these techniques to create more complex and intricate pieces . In this article , well cover three simple methods you can use . <p> Either purchase pieces of real leather , or go with faux leather or vinyl . Vinyl can often be found in many textures and colors in the home decor section of a fabric store . When shopping , pay careful attention to the way the fabric feels . Vinyl fabrics vary considerably in weight and hand . Some are stiff and heavy , while others are so soft and buttery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure . <p> Leather paint should be applied in thin coats . <p> Leather paints are acrylic-based paints created specifically for work on leather and faux leather . Though you can also use standard acrylic paints from a craft store , leather paints are not much more expensive and are made to adhere to these types of materials without chipping , peeling , or cracking over time . In our tests , we found they even held up to the moisture and heat of a steam iron . See the resources section below for information on where to purchase . <p> You will also need a small selection of paintbrushes to complete these techniques . Choose brushes that will allow you to create fine details , along with a brush for covering larger areas if you plan to create blocks of color . <p> Swatching will help you determine a palette and finalize your design . <p> Before beginning the painting process , test your paint on scraps of your chosen material . This is a good time to experiment with both color and design . Try painting a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors may require two or even three coats in order to achieve an even look . Overall , its better to create multiple thin layers of paint rather than a single thick layer . <p> If you find that the paint is not adhering to the material , its possible that the leather or vinyl has been treated with a silicone coating . Use a leather deglazer to help remove this coating before trying another sample swatch . <p> Once you 've decided on colors , cut your pattern pieces from the leather or faux leather . For the small bags shown here , we 've used the Valencia bag pattern to create small clutches . Each pattern was painted before sewing the bag together , which makes it easier to redo sections if there are any mistakes . Read on for three techniques you can use to create these designs . <p> 01 Method <h> Freehand patterns <p> The easiest way to create a painted pattern is by drawing freehand with your brush . This works best for simple abstract patterns with an organic look , such as these irregularly sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fly . The look should be natural and irregular , so do n't  worry too much about mistakes . Small irregularities are a part of the look . If you do make a large mistake , dip a cotton swab in acetone-based nail polish remover to touch up . <p> 02 Method <h> Method 2 : Simple stencils <p> For simple patterns such as stripes or blocks of color , use washi or masking tape to stencil your design . <h> Step 01 <p> Choose the size of your tape . 1/4 inch tape will create even , narrow stripes . 1/2 inch or larger tape can be used to create broad stripes , or simply create boundaries between larger blocks of color . <h> Step 02 <p> Apply the tape in your chosen pattern . You can create just a few stripes in multiple colors , or go with an overall repeat in a single color . Reposition the tape as you go to finalize your design before committing to paint . Use the edge of your nail or a coin to rub down the edges of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paint the piece using your chosen color . You may need multiple coats . Once dry , carefully remove the tape and touch up any peeled or imperfect areas . <p> 03 Method <h> Method 3 : Traced design <p> To create more intricate designs , first trace a design onto the material and fill in with paint . This method gives you the most creative freedom . You can find an existing design to add to your bag , or draw your own . For this bag , we used an art deco motif . You can find books of lovely motifs like this for use in artistic and craft projects ( see Resources section below ) . <h> Step 01 <p> Trace your design onto the material using dressmakers tracing paper or carbon paper . If necessary , go over the lines with pencil to make them easier to see . <h> Step 02 <p> Fill in the design with leather paint and a paintbrush . This technique can be used to create an all over pattern , or a single statement motif that follows the lines of the bag , such as this one .

@@36822581 @5822581/ <h> The Secret Life of Flannel <p> The humble fabric that is as versatile as it is comfortable , by Rachael Gander and Terri Kauffman . <p> What do you think of when you think of flannel ? <p> Most people picture lumberjacks , the 90s grunge scene , and cozy sheets , but flannel is so much more than that ! Along with its unmatched ability to hold in heat and wick away moisture , flannel is both sturdy and soft to the touch " making flannel a true fabric for the masses . From the tiniest baby to the most rugged outdoorsman ( or woman ) , and all the hipsters and sheet-lovers in between , flannel has something for every member of the family . Though its generally inexpensive and easy to work with , there is much to learn before getting started to be sure your next project is a success ! <h> Origin <p> The most basic thing to understand about flannel is that it is a fabric , not a pattern . Many people assume that all plaid shirts are flannel shirts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you want to get technical , plaid is a piece of fabric with a tartan pattern on it . Tartan has ancient origins , dating back to at least the sixth century B.C. hailing primarily from the Celtic tradition . <p> While tartan plaids have a long history , flannel has a more modern provenance . The origin of the word is unknown , but a fabric similar to flannel has been traced back to Wales as early as the sixteenth century . It was popular , because it was warm , sturdy , and inexpensive , making it the perfect choice for outdoor work garments . Its popularity grew after the Industrial Revolution and with the onset of mass production . <p> Flannel first made its way to the United States in 1869 , when it was used to make underwear in the form of long johns and then became a staple fabric for bedding and other household uses . <p> At the turn of the twentieth century , as logging and railroad building became an increasingly large segment of the American workforce , working men needed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow them the necessary ability to move around freely . It became even more common during the Great Depression when white-collar men were forced to trade in their suits and ties for blue-collar workwear . By the 1950s , Paul Bunyan , in his iconic tartan red flannel , had become a symbol of American machismo . <p> In the 90s , Kurt Cobain turned not giving a damn into a fashion explosion , proving that style and practicality did n't  have to be mutually exclusive and that you do n't  have to be rich and uncomfortable to be hip and fashionable . There is not a more perfect fabric with which to make that statement than the warm , inexpensive , comfortable versatility of flannel ! <h> Types and Applications <p> Originally , flannel was made from either carded wool or worsted yarn , but modern flannels can be made from either wool , cotton , or synthetic fiber . It can be woven with either a twill or a plain weave , and then is typically napped or brushed to give it that extra softness we expect from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosely spun yarn it is woven from . Its that extra softness that makes flannel an excellent choice for bedding , especially for quilts and winter sheets . Young or old , male or female , rich or poor , there is no better escape from a cold night in the dead of winter than curling up under those soft-napped fabrics . <p> Likewise , its softness and warmth make it an excellent fabric choice for any project made for babies , perfectly cuddling their soft skin . There is even a fabric choice called " baby flannel , " which is lightweight and breathable for nighttime sleeping . Older kids will also appreciate the cuddliness of a warm set of flannel pajamas for the winter ! <p> Many modern flannels are produced from cotton , as opposed to wool , to take advantage of the softness while avoiding its intense heat-saving properties . For those of us working outdoors , however , we may want to return to the original wool and its ability to not only keep us comfortable , but to hold in our natural body heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirts will be not only be rewarding , but will allow you to find the exact pattern you 're looking for with just the right fit . While men 's flannel shirts may be easy to come by in any store selling rugged , outdoor garments , it may not be so easy for the working woman to find something that offers not only the warmth and sturdiness of a well-made flannel shirt , but also delivers a cut that fits a womans curves with a pattern and colors that wo n't remind you of Paul Bunyan . <p> While flannel still holds a large and persistent foothold in our everyday fabrics , one item that has become increasingly difficult to find is a pair of standard , gray , flannel trousers . Kurt Cobain and the abundance of flannel pajamas have rocketed the fabric down the path of casual wear , and flannel trousers have been left behind . These used to be a staple of the American male closet but have drifted out of style , which is a shame considering their versatility . They look as sharp as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enviable drape and softness , they are casual enough to be worn with an everyday button-down or a comfortable polo . They are also dressier than jeans , yet similarly durable and resistant to stains and wrinkling . Despite the advantages , purchasing a pair of flannel trousers is not an easy task , and you 'll often find yourself at expensive high-end retailers like Brooks Brothers , where $250 for off-the-rack flannels is considered a great deal ! <h> Techniques and Tips <p> The flannel button-up is a classic garment . Negroni sews up beautifully in cotton or wool flannel . <p> Before you invest your time and energy in creating a great quilt , a sturdy work shirt , or a staple pair of gray flannel trousers , it 's important to know the fabric you 're working with so you do n't  lose all that hard work after one trip in the washing machine . <p> The first thing you should know is that flannel can be a loose weave . The looser the weave , the more it tends to stretch when sewing and shrink upon washing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because if it 's going to shrink , you 'll want it to do so before it 's been stitched together , not after . Wash and dry at least once on the warmest setting possible for your selected fabric . A starch spray or Flatter by Soak will also help to control the stretching , as will increasing the stitch length . <p> Flannel also frays easily , so it 's best to avoid intricate , complicated designs and to select larger pieces of fabric for quilts . Its also wise to cut the pieces a little larger than you would normally and to increase the seam allowance more than 1/4 " and up to 1/2 " . <p> Do not iron . Moving the iron back and forth over the fabric will create more stretching . Instead , press the fabric by holding the iron in place for a few seconds , then lifting , and do not use the steam setting . <p> Use a walking foot when possible and always start with a new needle . Working with flannel may dull your needle , and working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stitches . Flannel will also leave a lot of lint behind , so be sure to clean your machine often during your project . <p> The most important thing you can do when beginning a flannel project is to buy quality materials . We all want to save a buck where we can , but using sub-par materials on a project is undervaluing your time . Youre about to pour hours , days , maybe even weeks of your time " not to mention your heart and soul " into creating something special , and you do n't want saving a few bucks at the fabric store to cost you in the end . <p> Whether you choose cotton or wool flannel , the weight of your fabric will tell a lot about the quality . You can expect a medium-quality cotton flannel to weigh at least 5 oz. /square yard , while a high-quality cotton flannel will typically weigh over 6.5 oz. /square yard . Any cotton flannels under 5 oz. /square yard will likely be a loose weave and thus , will be more likely to stretch out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significantly heavier , and generally range from 10 " 20 oz. /square yard . <p> You will be able to tell more about the weave of your flannel by holding it up to the light . Because of the brushing , the actual weave can often be hard to see , but allowing the light to come through should give you a good idea of how tightly woven the fabric is . The looser the weave ( or the more light that comes through ) , the more likely you are to be handling a low-quality flannel that will shrink , wear , and may not be worth your time . <p> Flannel should also feel soft ! Touch the fabric before buying , or ask your favorite online shop for a swatch or sample . In addition to pre-washing the fabric for your project , you may also want to wash and dry a small cut of fabric repeatedly to make sure that it will not continue to shrink after multiple washes . <p> What are you waiting for ?

Perpetually fifteen minutes late and unable to scratch those stubborn items off my to-do list , I sprint through my day . By the time I make it back to my apartment , my brain is a jumbled heap of errands , bills , emails awaiting responses , meals to plan , and then there 's that laundry lying in an unfolded heap at the foot of the bed . I know I 've been busy , but have I done anything important ? Like a car stuck in a single gear , I feel unbalanced . And yet there 's still that long list of chores <p> Then I catch myself . Breathe . This is your night with the sewing machine , remember ? Close your laptop . Steep a cup of tea . Fish out your latest project , load up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the lamp near my sewing table and taken my first sip of tea , I can already feel my neck muscles beginning to unclench . The needle moves up and down in a soothing rhythm , and I fall into a steady pace : stitch , snip , stitch , snip , stitch , snip ; press , press , press . A garment takes shape beneath my fingers , and I smile at the elegant swoop of an armscye , the even parade of pintucks marching across a bodice . Running my fingertips over the fabric brings me out of my head and back into the present moment . I start remembering small things that went well today . I suddenly recall that my best friend 's birthday is coming up , and make a note to send him a card . <p> In many ways , sewing one 's clothing is the antithesis of modern life . It 's inefficient and time-consuming , analog instead of digital , often more expensive than outsourcing would be , low yield , and lacking instant gratification . Yet sewing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slow down and be present , to focus on quality instead of quantity , to connect with other members of the crafting community , and to value the process of creation just as much as the final product itself . In fact , sewing embodies many of the values of the slow life movement ( also called the Slow Movement ) . In the coming months , I 'll explore the intersection between sewing and the Slow Movement in a new monthly column here at Seamwork Magazine . <p> What is the Slow Movement ? The Slow Movement promotes a cultural shift toward slowing down the pace of life . It is an attempt to counteract the fast-paced , consumption-oriented , unbalanced , and impersonal nature of much of our modern lives . It is about living life fully but at a slower pace . Instead of constantly rushing , the Slow Movement celebrates the idea of finding the right pace for each part of our lives . Sometimes we may be called on to sprint , but other times we should be able to know when to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foster a greater connection with ourselves , our friends and family , our community , and our planet . <p> The Slow Movement encompasses a number of movements . Its origins lie in the slow food movement , which was born in 1986 as a protest against the opening of a McDonald 's near the Spanish Steps in Rome , Italy . The slow food movement seeks to promote local foods , traditional gastronomy , local and sustainable food production , and small businesses . It emphasizes knowing where our food comes from , what we 're eating , how it tastes , and how our food choices affect the rest of the world . <p> These kinds of values are reflected in other areas of the Slow Movement , which include travel , schools , cities , architecture and design , education , parenting , and yes , fashion . The slow fashion movement , like the slow food movement , arose , in part , as a reaction to fast fashion . Fast fashion is a lot like junk food . It can be addictive yet dissatisfying ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You get a short-term rush but miss out on long-term satisfaction , and it 's bad for you , your pocketbook , and the planet . And so the slow fashion movement arose . People participate in it in various ways . Making your own clothing is one possibility . Others frequent thrift stores , boycott throwaway fashion , repurpose old garments into new ones , seek out eco-friendly fabric or clothing , and support small labels , designers , and shops . <p> As part of this column , I 'll focus on various aspects of the slow fashion movement . We 'll cover topics like how to adopt an eco-conscious approach to sewing , or take a deeper dive into sourcing local supplies . <p> Another aspect of the column will be about the many intangibles that come with slowing down . I know that for me , crafting has helped me manage stress , learn , grow , and find a whole new community of likeminded individuals . In fact , one of my closest friends is a fellow sewist and writer who I met through my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to visit our local fabric store , and in the course of those visits we 'd take stock of our lives , trying to figure out how to live in a way that honored ourselves , our communities , and our planet . Our friendship , born of a mutual love for garment making , has spurred both of us to live lives that are more closely aligned with the Slow Movement . We 've supported each other through intrastate moves , book drafts , career changes , and relationship woes . All the while , we kept sewing . Crafting is an ends , but it is also a means . <p> I 've long suspected that slowing down has many benefits . It lowers our blood pressure . It can help us step back and maintain perspective on our lives : what 's really important , what to let go of , what to laugh at , what to fight for . Slowing down is about consciously choosing how we spend our time . Choosing to do less means focusing on the things that we enjoy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we value , so that we can center our lives around these values . Developing this relationship with ourselves " is this what I want ? is that what I value ? " is just one way that sewing can change lives .

What are they , how do they impact us , how do we build a sewing practice that cultivates the benefits of slowing down , and how have others incorporated these principles into their lives ? <p> In these coming months , I look forward to investigating the many benefits that come from slowing down and making one 's own clothing .

@@36822592 @5822592/ <h> Professional Profile : Claudia Echols <p> Claudia Echols plays an important yet little-known role in the fashion industry . As a Technical Apparel Designer , she works with fashion designers to actualize their vision through pattern drafting , fitting , and assembling a technical package for garment production . She is the middle-man that treads the line between vision and cost effectiveness , whose technical understanding of pattern making and fit can really make or break a design . <p> As a third-generation seamstress , Claudia has always been immersed in fashion and sewing . Even as a young girl , she would take her mothers scraps and drape on her Barbie dolls . After attending nursing school and raising a family , Claudia decided to do what makes her happy . At age 34 , she enrolled in an Apparel Design program at Oregon State University . She struggled to find her place in the fashion industry and eventually purchased Optitex and opened her business , Not the Norm , where she is currently using 3D technology for apparel pattern development and fit . <p> When sewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every garment must turn out exactly the same . Production sewing is very different than our accustomed style of home sewing . <p> For instance , Claudia does n't  use pins ! Instead , she constructs her garments utilizing thoughtfully placed notches . While sewing , these notches are matched to each other , one by one , throughout a seam , rather than pinned and then sewn . But even here , Claudia can sometimes experience push back . The more notches a garment has , the more expensive it is to produce . Often times garments are sewn in an assembly line , 100 at a time . When cutting a stack of 40 pieces of fabric , it can shift , and notches will turn out slightly too long and ruin a whole batch . <p> Also , garment production uses a different order of construction than your traditional home sewists . The longer the garment is able to lay flat , the less expensive it is to construct . For example , on a dress , production sewing would approach the back and front separately and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , the shoulders and collars would be sewn . At this point , the garment gets a bit more round , but still lays flat . Finally , the side seams would be the last seams sewn . The key is to avoid sewing in the round , which takes time and sometimes special sewing machine arrangements . <p> Claudia shows off a jacket mock-up , inspired by antique Japanese workwear . <p> After building the patterns and testing them , Claudia creates a technical package . These booklets include incredibly detailed illustrations , measurements , and construction order . The goal of the tech pack is to ensure precision and consistency between sizes . Claudias biggest challenge is creating a tech pack that is accessible , as many of the garment production teams she works with speak a language other than English . She must communicate important details about the garment with little to no wording . These tech packs are essentially the fashion industrys version of home sewings pattern instruction booklets , but are used to sew 100 garments in three colorways . <p> One thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work on a broad range of tasks , " I 'm not the one person in the factory pushing one button all day , I 'm the person who pushes eight buttons all at once " She is responsible for pattern work , grading , sample sewing , tech packs , and illustrations . The Technical Apparel Designer has the secret job that must be done in order for us to love our ready-to-wear clothing . <h> Claudias Favorite Tools <h> Jigs <p> Claudia creates tag board templates of each of her pattern pieces . These jigs last through many cuttings and allow Claudia to cut multiple garments without fear of slight changes in shape and markings . <h> Screw Punch <p> Claudia uses this screw punch to create small holes in her jigs for pocket , label , and dart markings . Her screw punch even has interchangeable points that create different sized holes . <h> Snips <p> These scissors can be worn like a ring while sewing and are always available for a quick snip . <h> Sewing Apron <p> This apron is Claudias pride and joy ! Designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tools and notions are accessible and easy to find . Its her sewing tool belt ! <h> Fitting A Gaping Armhole <p> Armhole gaping can occur for a few reasons : the bust dart is the incorrect size or missing , the armhole design cuts into the bodice without the proper contouring , or the starting pattern is designed for a sleeve and is being converted to a sleeveless design . No matter the reason , armhole gape can be solved with a simple bust dart rotation . If your garment does not already have a dart , these instructions still apply . <p> Close-fitting garments , unless designed for stretch fabric , must have bust and/or waist darts to achieve the proper fit . The basic unbreakable rule for bodice darts is that they must be stitched , rotated , or converted ; they can not be ignored . <p> On the fit garment or muslin , pinch out the gap in the armscye and measure the width of the gap . On the pattern piece , draw a line from the bust point to the notch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to the armscye , an equal distance away from the notch to the amount pinched on the muslin . These are your armhole dart legs . <p> Draw a line perpendicular to the grainline , from bust point to the side seam , this is line A. Draw a line from the center of the dart legs on the armscye to the bust point , this is line B. <p> Cut along line A and B , to the bust point , but not through it . Rotate the lower armscye section up until the dart legs align , tape in place . The result will be a new dart space on the side seam . <p> True the new armhole by redrawing in a new armhole curve using a French curve . <p> You have now successfully shortened the armscye . If you previously had a side seam dart , this will have added width to your dart . If you did not previously have a side seam dart , a new dart has been created . <p> A dart should be " backed off " from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve to the bust , rather than a stark point . Traditionally , dart points are backed off 1 " to 1 1/2 " from the bust point for fitted garments . <p> To do this , draw a line from the bust point to the center of your side seam dart . Measure approx. 1 1/2 " down this line and mark , this is your dart point . Draw new dart legs from the dart point to the end of the original dart legs . <p> To finish , fold the paper to close the dart and true the side seam . This will create a nicely shaped side seam without jagged edges once the dart is sewn . 185425 @qwx385425 <p> Katie teaches new skills through in-depth tutorials , sewalongs , and articles for Seamwork Magazine and The Colette Blog .

@@36822600 @5822600/ <h> Zero-Waste Fit <p> How to decrease waste in the fitting process , by Jessica Yen . <p> For slow-sewing adherents , our dream wardrobe includes staples that we reach for over and over . Excellent fit elevates an average garment into staple territory . Achieving that level of fit can require multiple attempts to get it right . If we want to sew in a way that minimizes our impact on the earth , how can we take waste out of the fitting process ? By applying the 4 Rs ( reduce , reuse , recycle , rot ) to this problem , we can identify multiple opportunities to do just this . <h> Consider the Source <h> Upcycled Muslins <p> Some of us started sewing with thrifted fabrics , and even if you 're now buying yardage from a fabric store , there 's no reason upcycled materials ca n't still be part of your repertoire . Those loud sheets that nobody wants ? They 're perfect for wrestling with fit issues ! Are they faded , worn , or sporting small holes ? Even better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for a song , and you 'll truly be rescuing fabric that nobody else wanted . <h> All-Natural Muslins <p> All-natural fibers came from the earth and thus can be returned to the earth . For those with ready access to an easy way to take advantage of that fourth R , rot , this may be the way to go . Just be sure to use thread made from a natural fiber , like cotton . As with all composting , it 's a good idea to shred the fabric and mix it with other types of natural waste materials . <p> This idea caught on at FIT , where two students created a muslin composting system for the cotton muslin that was used in their classes . They point out that cotton muslin is free of the chemicals associated with dyeing , printing , and finishing fabric " a consideration worth keeping in mind as you consider what types of natural fabrics to use . <h> Decrease Your Footprint <p> Once you 've picked your muslin material , here are a few strategies for decreasing the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's Important <p> A muslin is a test run for both fit and construction , but you do n't need to mock up the entire garment to get a sense for these key elements . Before starting in on a muslin , it 's a good idea to first ask yourself what information you 're primarily interested in . A fitted bodice , skirt , or trousers might need to be muslined in its entirety , but if you 're working with a less-fitted garment you may be able to check the finished measurements against clothes you like . This also applies if parts of the garment are less fitted " a fit-and-flare dress may only need the bodice muslined , for example . Likewise , if you 're making a semi-fitted shirtdress but have never sewn tower plackets before , maybe the plackets are the only thing you actually want to try out . <p> Linings can be eliminated . So can certain kinds of pockets " instead of mocking up welt pockets , for example , draw them on with chalk so you can check their size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets , just be sure to fold out the seam allowance when tracing them onto your muslin . You can even eliminate yoke pockets , or at least one yoke pocket , in your muslins . <p> Similarly , for many of us , our arms are relatively symmetrical , so we 'll only need to muslin one sleeve , one lapel , etc . Just remember that a muslin will tell you about a garment 's overall proportions , including the relative size of details like cuffs and collars , so do n't get too aggressive with your muslin skimping . <h> Itsy Bitsy Teenie WeenieMuslin Pieces <p> It 's entirely possible to reuse muslin pieces , especially larger pattern pieces . Princess-seamed bodices , two-piece sleeves , collars , pockets , yokes , and waistbands are all potential candidates for smaller pattern pieces that can be cut from old muslins . How far you take this depends on your willingness to keep tiny scraps of fabric around . In general , if a piece is somewhat rectangular and at least 15 inches in one direction , I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate way to minimize waste in the fitting process is to do away with muslins entirely . Get ready for a walk on the wild side ! Here are a couple tips to help you eradicate muslins from your sewing life . <h> Know Your Numbers <p> Flat pattern adjustments are the changes you make to a pattern piece before you cut your fabric . The better you get at these , the fewer surprises you 're likely to run into when you sew up the garment . Bust , waist , and hip are typical starting points for flat pattern adjustments , but there are many other measurements you can track . The better you know your own measurements , the more up-front adjustments you can make . Another option is to take a pattern that fits you well and compare those pattern pieces to the pattern you 're currently working on . As you continue to sew , keep a running tally of which adjustments you typically make . <h> Widen Those Seam Allowances <p> The Royal Shakespeare Company creates costumes with one-inch seam allowances to allow for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be used here . It 's a good idea to widen it to a two-inch seam allowance for items that are notably difficult to fit , like trousers , or for the types of patterns where you often run into fitting difficulties . This approach is most successful when combined with flat pattern adjustments . <p> Which strategy you use will depend on your sewing experience , the type of pattern you 're using , how many adjustments you typically need to make , as well as your personal preferences and circumstances . For the most part , if you combine two or more strategies into one project , you 'll produce less waste than if you use just one strategy . <p> Muslining with upcycled fabrics reuses fabric , but muslining with upcycled scraps puts these salvaged materials through two or three use cycles . Likewise , if you have a detailed list of flat pattern adjustments that you are confident about , you may feel comfortable using one-inch seam allowances ( or even regular seam allowances ) on a tricky pattern .

Because of this wall , they are hesitant to try sewing , or maybe they never even consider it in the first place .

Many people , including a lot of women , believe that sewing is not for them . <p> In episode 3 of Seamwork Radio , I spoke to sewing enthusiast Matthew Holloway about his journey to sewing . He said , " It was normal for women to sew and as a boy and a young man interested in sewing , that was n't normal for me to be interested in .

I cut my mousy hair into a short pixie crop , which I would eventually dye burgundy red and then purple . I paired big thermal sweaters with short skirts and stompy boots .

My life prior to having children was about my job , commute , friends , and social life in London . My identity and sense of self was tied up in those things . Despite seeing myself as a creative person , I never did anything creative . I worked . Hard . I went out and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was it . But that all stopped when I had my children . We moved out of London , away from friends . I was n't working or going out at all ; I was left floundering . After the initial all-consuming joy of having babies , I was left with this big hole , that , as much as I adore my children , couldnt be filled by caring for them alone . <p> I had defined myself for such a long time through my job and my life in London , and suddenly it was n't there anymore . I did n't  know who I was or who I should be ; my whole sense of myself had been completely upended . Was this it ? How was I going to fulfill all of the things I had planned for me , all the possible versions of my life , all the possible me 's , if this was it ? <p> You only have to look at the number of sewing blogs and sewing-related businesses run by stay-at-home moms to realize that I am probably not alone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position to think proactively about how to tackle these feelings and was diagnosed with post-natal depression . I was referred for therapy , and one of my objectives as part of that was to force myself to spend some time each day doing a hobby or something that I get satisfaction from . Sewing was the only thing I could think of that I had the tools for already and meant I could still be in my house with the kids . <p> So I started making . Little things at first : baby pants , a gathered skirt for my daughter , cushions , but then as I read more and more blogs , I found the world of indie sewing patterns and off I went . And then we upped sticks and moved across the Atlantic and I discovered New York City 's Garment District and , well , that was enough to ignite a full blown sewing craze blaze ! <p> Sewing has become hugely important to me . If I do n't  sew for a couple of days , I can feel myself getting antsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ; something that is a representation of my abilities above caring for and loving my children . Something that taps into a long suppressed creative side , something that allows me to do things how I think they should be done . <p> Sewing helped restore my sense of self . In fact , I think it has not just restored it , but it is actually helping me understand who I am , what I want from my life , and what is important in a way I did n't  know before . <p> A large part of this is due to the sewing community . Here , I feel like I have found my tribe : Those folk , who are part geek , part introvert , part perfectionist , part fashion fiend ; people who are trend aware , detail-focused , style conscious , anti-conformist , vocal , passionate , tactile , and creative . I see myself in the people I have met in the virtual sewing community and have realized it 's OK to be one of those folk . Although this little corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , it 's a happy , healthy , productive , inspiring , and supportive one . <p> I have always been ambitious and competitive and always wanted a high-flying career , but never quite got there . This was the source of much disappointment , feelings of failure , being envious of my friends who seemed to have it , and bitterness towards my employers whom I blamed for my stagnation . Paradoxically , that person , that person who worked so hard , that person whose identity was her job , never felt like me ; I always felt like an imposter " as if I was going be exposed at any moment for not knowing what I was talking about . Contorting myself to fit the corporate mold and then a prescribed mother mold hammered my confidence . <p> Sewing is enabling me to create my own Charlotte-shaped mold , and my confidence is slowly growing . Sewing rules are there for interpretation and misinterpretation . A pattern is a starting point rather than a manifesto . A seam finish is my decision . I can express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I feel happy with what is emerging . <p> It is hard to describe , but this flexibility with the rules and how one interprets them has opened my eyes and given me more confidence in my own way of doing things , not only as a person who sews , but also more widely in my life . Gradually , I do n't feel like an imposter or that I have to fit a certain mold , or subscribe to a certain parenting style . I can decide my own way of being a mother , my own way of being a role model to my children , rather than constantly benchmarking it to others or worrying I should n't do something for fear of being judged . I have new confidence in my way being the right , or at the very least , an OK way . <p> This confidence is bolstered by feeling like I have found something I am good at ( or so I 'm told ) , that I have something to contribute and I actually know what I 'm talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant learning and the huge sense of productivity that are byproducts fulfill my need not to stagnate , to be industrious and to do something that is just for me when life with two small kids can often not feel like my own . <p> All of these revelations stem , I believe , from the meditative and methodical process of sewing . Losing myself in a particularly tricky sleeve insertion , or repetitively doing the same movement over and over on a long hand-stitched hemline provides not only escapism , but also time and space to contemplate . <p> So , whilst the first few years of motherhood have been both a joy and a challenge , and I think depression is something I will always live with , these two life-changers have lead me to sewing , which in turn is taking me down a path where I have found community , creativity , clarity , and confidence . Where it ultimately leads for me , in terms of my career , I still do n't know , but with this new appreciation of who I am and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mother , I 'm OK with that . 185425 @qwx385425 <p> Charlie is a Brit sewing up a storm in Brooklyn .

Knitters and non-knitters alike can create their own sweaters in just a couple hours when sewing with sweater knit fabrics . <p> The Oslo cardigan can be constructed in just a few hours and can be made in bulky wool knits , merino jersey , cotton jersey , or just about any other knit fabric you can think of ; but sewing with sweater knits gives it that truly handmade look . Not only that , but sweater knits offer tremendous variety . Read on to learn how to construct a huge variety of looks from one pattern . <h> Sweater knits demystifyed <p> What exactly is a sweater knit , and what makes them different from any other knit ? <p> The term " sweater knit " can be used to describe a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to resemble fabrics that are knit by hand , with a great deal of texture or fuzziness . The knit patterns also tend to be open , with thicker individual yarns than what you might see in other knits , such as jersey . <p> Sweater knits are by no means the only type of knits that can be used to sew a sweater . Depending on the final look you want , wool or cotton jersey , rib knits , novelty knits , and even lingerie fabrics can be used to construct sweater-like projects . But sweater knits will get you closest to the look you might imagine when you picture a cozy sweater . <p> Sweater knits come in a range of styles and patterns . Some are quite loose , made with fine gauge yarns in lacy eyelet patterns . Sometimes these types of knits are also referred to as " crochet knits " in stores because of their lacy look , though they are usually not crocheted . Other sweater knits have the loose look , but without lacy patterns . Still others are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Depending on which you use , you may want to vary your sewing techniques . <h> Six helpfulsweater knit tips <p> Cut extra seam allowance for open or lacy knits that are prone to fraying or unraveling . <p> Use a stretch needle to prevent puncturing the fabric . <p> Minimize pressing , so you do n't  flatten the texture with heat and steam . <p> When pressing is needed , apply just the tip of the iron to the seam . <p> Stabilize areas that are prone to stretching , such as shoulders , by sewing in clear elastic . <p> Wash finished garments carefully by hand , avoiding heat or agitation . <p> 02 Section <h> The magic of mesh <p> Stretch mesh is an all-purpose helper when it comes to sewing with sweater knits . You can use it to add structure , keep seams from fraying , and add stability to seams . <p> If you 've sewn with woven fabrics in the past , you 're likely most familiar with fusible interfacings . Interfacing adds additional stability , crispness , and weight to an area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these qualities are n't  always what you 're going for . <p> Still , there are times when a little extra stability can come in handy with these loose fabrics . For those situations , try using a stretch mesh fabric as interfacing . These fabrics are most often found in the lingerie section of the fabric store . They work well because they stretch along with your knit fabric , are light enough to prevent added bulk , and are nearly invisible . <p> Look for a mesh that closely matches your main fabric , or choose one that comes close to your skin tone . Here are a few ways you can use mesh along with your sweater knit to make sewing easier : <p> Use it as a sew-in interfacing for any area that needs a little more structure . <p> Sew strips of mesh into seams to stabilize them and keep them from stretching out over time . <p> Use strips of mesh to bind the raw edges of your seam allowance and prevent fraying . <p> Cut squares of mesh and baste them behind buttonholes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw edge of a hem before turning and stitching it . <p> 03 Section <h> Sewing with lacy or open sweater knits <p> If the sweater knit you 've chosen for your project is an open knit or lacy , follow a few extra guidelines to prevent excessive fraying . <h> Cutting <p> Begin by cutting extra seam allowance with your pattern . Most patterns designed for knits have seam allowances of only 3/8 inch . This may be too narrow for lacy knits , because the holes created by the lace can easily go beyond the seam allowance and cause fraying . Depending on the looseness of the knit , use a seam allowance of 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch . <h> Stitching seams <p> Stitch the seams of the sweater with the zigzag stitch of your sewing machine , setting the length to 2.00mm and the width to 1.5mm . This narrow zigzag will allow your seams to stretch , preventing them from popping when the sweater is worn . Because the stitches of a serger are narrow , the zigzag stitch is better suited for these types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish the raw edges . You can either use a serger at this point , or sew another row of zigzag stitches along the raw edge to secure all the threads and prevent further fraying . <h> Hemming <p> To hem an open lacy knit , first finish the raw edge . You can do this by binding it with a strip of stretch mesh , or try sewing a band of stretch lace around the edge . Stretch lace can often be found among the lingerie fabrics at your local sewing store , and will stretch along with the garment while remaining inconspicuous . <p> Once the edge is finished , turn the hem up and sew invisibly by hand using a catchstitch . <p> 04 Section <h> Sewing with dense sweater knits <p> Some sweater knits are quite dense and require different handling than open knits . <h> Stitching seams <p> To sew seams , you may use a serger if you choose . Be sure to test sew a scrap of fabric before constructing your entire garment to make sure your fabric will hold up . Alternately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructed for the open knits . If you sew with a zigzag , be sure to finish the raw edges afterward , just as you would with an open knit , by zigzagging or serging the raw edges to prevent fraying . <h> Hemming <p> To hem a dense knit like this , you may use the same hand sewing techniques as you would for an open knit , or you can turn the hem and use a twin needle to stitch . A twin needle creates two parallel rows of stitching and allows the hem to stretch when worn . <p> 05 Section <h> Caring for sweater knits <p> Once you 've finished your cardigan , take care of it so it lasts . The rules for caring for a hand sewn sweater are similar to a hand knit . <p> Sweater knits should be pre-washed by hand before cutting or sewing , and finished sweaters should be cleaned in the same way . To hand wash , gently squeeze soapy water through the fabric until its saturated . Do not agitate , scrub , or squeeze vigorously , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool . Allow the knit to soak . To remove soapy water , fill the sink with fresh water and gently squeeze out suds . Drain the water and repeat until the water is clear and soap free . Lay the fabric or sweater flat to dry .

We started simple ; he wanted a new bag , so we used the Cooper pattern and some Pendleton wool to create a backpack together . I watched him learn new sewing terms , guided him through topstitching , and helped him install his first lining . <p> When the bag was done , he said he felt good .

There 's no shortage of men who enjoy DIY hobbies , so why not sewing ? <p> There are some simple and obvious answers : There are fewer patterns available for men .

Its true that there are fewer patterns and resources for sewing menswear , but there 's certainly enough out there to sew a whole wardrobe of classic pieces . And its also true that fewer men are interested in fashion , but many are interested in quality and the details of clothing construction .

It means rejecting the idea that something is frivolous just because women do it . It means seeing beyond the narrow confines of masculinity and caring a little less about what other people think . It means rejecting sexism , because the same sexism that hurts women hurts men too . <p> It also means taking part in a creative pursuit that is incredibly rewarding , endlessly challenging , and extremely practical . <p> If you 're interested in hearing more from men who sew , I invite you to check out upcoming episodes of our new podcast , Seamwork Radio .

There were scrunchies and wide headbands . <p> Everything matched perfectly or you were doing the look wrong . " You do not match , " I remember one little girl telling another on the playground one day in sixth grade .

@@36822629 @5822629/ <h> Sewing with intention <p> I love to ask people why they sew . It seems that there are almost as many reasons as there are sewists . Here are just a few I 've heard : <p> " I sew because it makes me feel more connected to my grandmother , who taught me . " <p> " I do it because I love clothes , but I wanted a way to slow down my consumption of them while still enjoying fashion . " <p> " I sew as a way to treat myself well and spend time on something that makes me feel good about who I am . " <p> " It helps me to live a more creative life . " <p> " Sewing makes me feel empowered over my body and how I dress it .

Today , if you live in a fairly wealthy country , its much easier ( and some would say more practical ) to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practicing , and creating . <p> The reasons for that choice are varied , but they all come down to one thing : intention . <p> The word " intention " may sound highfalutin or new age-y to some , but to me its a vital part of what sets sewists apart in the world . We are people who not only see the world a little differently , but take small steps to do something about it . <h> Intention starts with curiosity <p> Living with intention , whether in small ways or large , comes from having a specific viewpoint on the world . That view comes from a sense of curiosity , something many sewists tend to share . We do n't  take the world at face value . We see things a little differently than most . <p> From that viewpoint comes a sense of values , and a desire to live within those values . Perhaps we want to change the world , or change ourselves or the relationship between those two things . We want to act . <p> Intention is the link between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage within it . It connects our values and our actions . <p> Sewing may seem small and insignificant in some ways , but for each of us , its a way to bring our view of the world into our daily lives . This intention reverberates in many ways . It affects not only ourselves and our immediate environment . It also shows others that there are other ways of seeing the world and engaging with it . You do n't  have to live like everyone else , or dress like everyone else , or shop like everyone else . <p> The Hayden top comes in both a standard and a cropped lengthStay comfortable and elegant in the Seneca skirt <p> In this issue , we explore the concept of intention from several angles .

When you paint with dye , you can create fabric that looks like a watercolor painting . Best of all , this technique wo n't change the natural texture of the fabric . While it works equally well on several types of fabric , including cotton canvas , my favorite fabrics to paint on are silk and linen . <h> Supply List <p> Procion dye powder <p> Sodium alginate ( used as a thickener " it 's made from seaweed ! ) <p> Urea <p> Soda ash ( necessary for Procion dyes ) <p> Fabric ( use a natural fiber such as cotton , linen , or silk , and be sure to match your fabric content to the type of dye ) <p> Rubber or nitrile gloves* <p> Dust mask <p> Paintbrushes <p> Plastic or glass containers* ( one large container such as a gallon jug for preparing the thickened base , and several smaller containers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Bucket* <p> Tarp <p> Towels or cardboard <p> Synthrapol fabric detergent ( optional ) <p> *As with any dye project , once you use a tool for this project it should not be used for food , for health and safety reasons . <h> Resources <p> I ca n't say enough good things about Dharma Trading Company . They have reasonable prices and sell all the supplies you need for this project , which makes it really simple to pull together everything you need to get started . <h> A Note about Procion Dye Colors <p> Procion dyes come in a vast array of colors . When starting a project , first choose a color palette for your project " one or more colors that work well together . You can use almost any of the available colors to paint on fabric , and the result should come close to the swatch color . There are two exceptions you should know about . Black dye is always a bit tricky in my experience , and never quite as inky as I would like it to be ; also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just does n't work very well for cold painting and usually results in a blue-purple . Also , gray dye tends to turn lavender . Both are really beautiful , but can be disappointing if you were hoping for pure black or gray . Whatever your palette , it 's always a good idea to paint a small sample before starting your project . <h> A Note on Brushes <p> As with all painting , the brush you choose will affect the end result . A wide , bristly paintbrush from the hardware store will produce rough , brushy edges in your design . A soft , fluffy watercolor brush from the art supply store will result in soft-edged , rounded forms . When you 're starting out , consider picking out a couple different brushes to see what suits you . <p> A bristly brush ( left ) can produce a beautiful , rough look , such as this brushy pattern on linen ( right ) . <h> Setting Up <p> To get started , wash your fabric and cover your workspace with tarps to prevent staining . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base . Put on your dust mask and gloves , and let 's get started . I 've found that this recipe is enough for about 1.5 yards of fabric ( depending on the absorbency of the fabric and your technique ) . It can easily be scaled to match the size of your project . <p> 4 c. warm ( not hot ! ) tap water <p> 3/4 c . Urea <p> 1 tbsp. sodium alginate thickener ( extracted from seaweed , the sodium alginate is what will thicken the dye mixture so you can paint with it ) <p> Mix these ingredients in a large plastic or glass container with a lid , and let it sit for a couple of hours until the sodium alginate thickener has worked its magic . Use this time to set up your fabric so it 's ready to paint . The fabric should be laid out flat on cardboard or towels . If the fabric is n't totally flat , the dye may travel to the low spots and pool . Bear in mind that the towels will also be dyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dye base has thickened , put your gloves back on , and then pour the thickened base into the smaller plastic or glass containers . Use one container for each color , and if you 're planning on using a lot of one color , then split up the thickened base unevenly at this stage . Make a mental note of roughly how much thickened base is in each container . <p> Put your dust mask on , keep those gloves on , and mix soda ash into the thickened base . Use one teaspoon of soda ash for each cup of base . Now , grab your Procion dye powders . For each cup of thickened base , I use about -+ " -+ teaspoon of dye powder . Paste-up the dye powder with a small amount of plain water ( start with -+ teaspoon , and slowly add more water , up to about 2 teaspoons ) . This is a bit like making gravy " it 's important to mix the dye thoroughly so that there is no unmixed dye powder , otherwise you can end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks strain their dye-mix through silk in order to avoid streaks . I always have good results from slowly and carefully mixing the powder , but if you notice stubborn bits of pigment , you can try straining it . <p> After your dye is evenly mixed into a small amount of water , slowly add it , one color per container , to the thickened base . This is what you will paint with . <p> Take note : soda ash activates Procion dye , causing it to bond with the fabric . However , once you mix these two , the dye has a very limited shelf-life . You will want to finish up your project in an afternoon . <h> Painting <p> Now comes the fun part : break out those brushes and get painting ! Be sure to keep your gloves on throughout this process to protect your hands . Of course you can paint whatever you want , but here are a few suggestions to get you started . <h> Watercolor <p> A soft , watercolor-style result . <p> The dye looks a little darker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed and dried . <p> First wet your fabric , and then paint in a free-flowing and loose style . If you want pastel colors , wait only 15 to 30 minutes after you have finished painting to wash out your fabric . <h> Polka Dots <p> To create polka dots , just paint dots all over the fabric . It 's simple , but the softness of the dye and the slight variations from the human hand will add a little something to this classic design . Keep in mind that the dye will spread on damp fabric , but it wo n't spread too much , if at all , on dry fabric . <p> Brush choice can change your design in exciting ways , such as in these two very different takes on a polka dot design . <h> Two-Tone <p> Paint your fabric with different colors in two sections , and either let the colors meet and mix to create a third color , or leave a line of undyed white in between the colors . <p> A simple , two-tone design can be very sophisticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are due to small inconsistencies in the application of the dye . <p> First painting a line of water , then painting dye along that line , will produce this soft , irregular fade . <h> Pro Tip <p> A lot of the beauty of this technique comes from keeping things loose and painterly . Keep a bucket of clean water and a clean paintbrush nearby so you can strategically dampen the fabric to create soft , washy edges on your patterns . <h> A Note on Mistakes <p> At some point , you may make a mistake . Maybe you drop a second color onto a single-color design , or maybe what you intended to be a small spot turns into a big blob . If this happens to you , just work with it . Once that weird spot is there , it 's nearly impossible to remove . Washing it immediately will soften the color , but most likely it will still be visible . You can leave the mistake as an erratic , quirky design element , or you can change your design to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design to accommodate a mistake become my favorite part of the design . <p> After you 've finished painting , let the fabric sit flat for 15 " 90 minutes . The longer that the dye sits on the fabric , the darker the colors will become , and you can play around with the timing ( letting the fabric sit beyond 90 minutes , for example ) . In my examples , the two-tone design sat for around 90 minutes before I rinsed the fabric , whereas the soft pink design on silk ( below ) sat for only 15 minutes or so . <p> Even small , subtle areas of dye can be stunning , such as the slight pattern on the silk in the bottom right . <p> Finally , rinse out the dye mixture in cool water , then wash the fabric with synthrapol or your usual detergent . <p> This approach to fabric dye is so open-ended , and the possible designs are plentiful . The designs covered in this article are just a starting point " you can mix and match them , try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freehand a completely unique design .

@@36822638 @5822638/ <h> A Lesson in Lining <p> The guide to drafting linings for unlined jackets and coats , by Sabrina Lee . <p> When I first started sewing my own clothes , I would always omit the lining in my rush to complete the garment . Over time , I discovered that these unlined garments did not feel nice to wear or look nice from the inside , and I gradually came to the realization that the lining is an indispensable part of most garments . Linings can do a number of magical things : they cover up interfacings , pocket bags , and other interior construction elements to give the garment a clean interior finish ; they prolong the life of the garment ; they allow the garment to slip on and off smoothly ; and they make the garment feel nice against the skin so it is more comfortable to wear . <p> Adding linings to garments is a relatively simple process , though care must be taken to draft the lining pattern correctly , select appropriate lining fabric , and use suitable construction methods . <h> Drafting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern does not include a lining pattern , fear not " it is easy to draft a lining pattern from an existing jacket or coat pattern following the step-by-step instructions below . <p> Before we launch into the detailed instructions , it is worth noting that these instructions are for drafting a full coat or jacket lining ( not a partial lining ) , with front and back facings . This lining method gives the garment a more professional finish , and is closer to the look of ready-to-wear . <h> Preparing Your Pattern <p> Whenever you are making big changes to a pattern " for instance changing the structure or construction , rather than moving a dart or executing a small bust adjustment " it is key to trace your sewing pattern onto a new fresh piece of pattern paper . <p> When tracing your pattern , be sure to transfer all vital marks such as grainline , darts , and notches . Do n't  forget to clearly label all pieces ! <p> Lastly , you will also want to remove all seam allowances .

This allows for greater arm movement and ensures the lining does not affect the way the sleeve hangs on the outside . <p> NOTE : If you have a jacket with princess seams that come to the armhole , make sure you add height to the armhole on both pattern pieces , as shown in the example below . <h> Step 04 <p> Remove 1 ? from the hem of the front lining , and add your desired seam allowance to the front lining piece ( I used a seam allowance of 5/8 ? ) .

To draft the overlap portion of the vent , trace the right back vent extension onto the left back lining . <h> Step 07 <p> Remove 1 ? from the hem of the back linings , and add your desired seam allowance to back lining pieces ( I used a seam allowance of 5/8 ? ) .

While a lot of thought is typically put into choosing the right fashion fabric for the garment , often little attention is paid to the lining , which is unfortunate because the right choice of lining fabric can make a big difference to the quality of the final product . <p> There is no one perfect lining that suits all garments and all wearers . The choice of lining fabric depends on the style of the coat or jacket and the wearer 's needs : <p> In general , it is preferable to use fabrics made of natural fibers to line a garment , as those fabrics will breathe , feel nice against the skin , and press beautifully . <p> Silk charmeuse or crepe de Chine makes a lovely lining for dressier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin , and its slippery finish allows the garment to slide on and off easily . Silk also comes in a variety of vibrant colors and prints , which can add a nice design detail to your garment . <p> Wool flannel can be used as an interlining ( i.e. , as an extra layer between the fashion fabric and the lining fabric , also known as an underlining to add extra warmth ) . Avoid using wool as the lining fabric itself , as it can lead to static and feel itchy against the skin . Teaming up a wool flannel interlining with a silk lining can marry the best of both worlds " the warmth of wool and the luxury of silk . <p> For maximum warmth , use something like thinsulate , a performance fabric that is often used to line sporty jackets . However , this will add quite a bit of bulk and should be avoided if the jacket or coat has a fitted silhouette . <p> A lightweight cotton lining can be nice for casual summer jackets , because it breathes and feels cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets : regardless of the fabric used for lining the rest of the garment , it is worth using an extra durable fabric for the pocket bags because they get a lot of wear and are often the first part of the lining to tear . When I first started sewing , I was lazy and questioned whether it was really necessary to purchase yet another fabric to use in my garment , but I soon learned my lesson when holes would appear in the pockets after only a few months of wear ! After that , I began using pocketing fabric ( a densely woven and durable fabric such as cotton twill or cotton broadcloth ) for any pockets that will likely be subject to a lot of wear ( such as the waist and hip pockets in jackets and coats , where people often jam their hands ) . Using pocketing fabric also has the added benefit of keeping the pocket opening crisp , which is particularly important if they are welt , slanted , or in-seam pockets . <h> Lining Construction Methods <p> Once the lining pattern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining step is to cut and sew the lining . There are a number of different construction methods that can be used to construct linings , and the choice of construction method depends on a number of factors , including the style of the garment , the fabric used in the outer garment , and your tolerance for hand sewing . An overview of four different construction methods is given below , along with links to online tutorials and books that have step-by-step instructions on how to execute each construction method . <h> Bagging the Lining <p> This is the fastest method and is used in ready-to-wear . In essence , the process involves three main steps : first , construct the entire lining using the machine the same way you would construct the outer garment . Second , stitch the lining to the outer garment , leaving an opening large enough to turn the garment right side out . Finally , turn the garment right side out and stitch the opening closed by hand . <p> Bagging the lining is quick and painless , and involves virtually no hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control over the distribution of ease in the armhole and the placement of the hem , which can affect how the sleeve or hem hangs . Completely machine bagging the garment can also be a bit confusing for beginners , as the garment needs to be turned inside and right-side out a few times-it certainly boggled my mind the first few times I tried machine-bagging ! <h> Check out : <h> Hand-Setting the Lining <p> This method is typically used in bespoke tailored jackets and is more time-consuming than the machine-bagging method . First , the body lining and the sleeve lining are constructed by machine ( but the sleeve is not attached to the body ) . The body lining is then machine-stitched to the outer garment at the front and neck edges , then turned right side out . The lower edge of the sleeve lining is sewn to the garment sleeve , then the lining is pulled into the garment and stitched to the bodice at the armhole by hand , which gives the sewist extra control over the amount of ease in the armhole . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more time consuming than machine bagging , this method can be easier for the beginning sewist to implement , as it does not require any confusing steps involving turning the garment inside out and then right side in . This method also gives greater control over setting the armhole lining and hems , which helps ensure that the sleeves and hem of the garment all fall correctly . <h> Check out : <p> The Anise jacket features a hand-set lining ; all of the details are included in this sewalong post . <h> Chanel-Style Quilted Lining <p> This method involves quilting the lining to the fashion fabric and is , as its name suggests , used in Chanel jackets . Quilting is often done with boucle or other fabrics that fray easily because the quilting adds structure to the fabric , while also giving a lovely finish to the interior of the garment . It is most appropriate for cardigan-style jackets or other jackets with a slouchy silhouette , but not for tailored garments with interfaced lapels and collars . <p> This method is extremely time consuming and involves a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or those who lack patience . However , the effort is well worth it , as this construction method results in a lovely garment with some of the structure of a tailored jacket or coat and the comfort and feel of a sweater . <h> Check out : <h> Detachable Lining <p> This method involves making a detachable lining that is attached to the outer garment using buttons or zippers . Detachable linings are usually found in all-weather coats with a fair amount of ease , because the detachable lining adds quite a bit of bulk , making it inappropriate for fitted silhouettes . One famous example is the classic Burberry trench , which includes a detachable wool lining rendered in the famous Burberry plaid .

By Madalynne Flanigan . <p> It seems so simple : elastic that is n't white , black , or cream . For most of home sewers , getting the perfect hue to match our sewing project is all too elusive .

Sure , you might be able to source the random hot pink fold over variety , but in my experience , the quality is sub-par . <p> By nature , we sewers are people who take charge . Is n't that why we got into this hobby ? Just like all other aspects of a project , getting that perfect tint requires you to take the bull by its horns " dye the elastic yourself ! Yes , you might need a pair of gloves , but this science project does n't require the brain of Einstein . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are outlined below . I call it the sacred writ of dyeing elastic . <p> 01 Section <h> All about elastic <p> Before customizing your elastic , make sure you 've picked out the right kind for your project . <h> What is elastic ? <p> Elastic is made from a series of rubber or stretchable synthetic cores that are most often wrapped in polyester , cotton or nylon , which is either braided , woven or knit together . Elastic is offered in a variety of thicknesses , widths and amounts of stretch . It can be threaded through casings such as on a pajama pant or stitched directly to fabric such as on a swimsuit . Both create fullness in a particular area , allowing movement but keeping the garment in place . Elastic quality and behavior are determined by the elastic 's construction and fiber content . Good quality elastic stretches more than twice its length and then returns to its original measurement . <p> Generally , elastic is between 1/8 ? and 2 1/2 ? wide . Narrow elastic is often used in necklines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 3/4 ? in width is more commonly used in waistbands . <h> Common elastic sizes <h> Types of elastic <p> Elastic is categorized by its fiber content and construction , and each plays a role in its behavior and end use . <p> Braided elastic : Used inside casings such as on pajama pants . It narrows when stretched and loses its stretch and shape when pierced or stitched through . Braided elastic has distinctive lengthwise , parallel ribs and is used primarily on sleeve hems , swimwear , and leg openings . <p> Knitted elastic : Soft , strong , and appropriate for most apparel items . Because it 's lightweight , it 's best used on lightweight fabrics . It does n't narrow when stretched and it is not affected when pierced by a needle , making it suitable for direct application to fabric . <p> Woven elastic : Very strong and usually thicker than the other elastics . It 's used on heavy weight fabrics such as home dec , car covers , bags , and accessories . It has both crosswise and lengthwise ribs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needle piercing weaken it . Therefore , it can be used in casings or stitched directly to fabric . <p> Transparent polyurethane : Also called clear elastic . It is neither braided , knitted , nor woven . It is a synthetic product that stretches three to four times its length with complete recovery . It 's most often directly applied to fabric ; stabilizing shoulder seams is a popular use . <p> Elastic will take dye differently depending on its fiber content . <h> Elastic fibers <p> Nylon/rubber elastic : Has a soft luster and is used on swimwear and lingerie . It is machine washable , but should be dried in medium heat . <p> Cotton/rubber elastic : Shrinks , though not a lot , and should not be dry-cleaned . It is ideal for wash-and-wear fabrics and can be dried in medium to high temperatures . It is perfect for people who prefer wearing natural fibers . <h> Choosing elastic <p> Many types of elastic are meant for specific sewing tasks . As a general rule , select elastic that has the same care requirements as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information for its best use . Only use elastic that recovers to its original length after stretching . Braided elastic narrows when stretched , so only use it inside casings . <h> Tips forSewing Elastic <p> Use a ball-point needle ; if elastic contains spandex , use a stretch needle . <p> Keep an eye on thread tension ; you may need to adjust it when stitching elastic . <p> The elastic should be snug enough to prevent the fabric from drooping , but loose enough to be comfortable . To ensure comfort in garments , wrap the elastic around your body and pin it closed . Wear it for a half hour , and adjust the length as needed . Cut elastic the desired length plus 1 ? for finishing the ends . <p> Use a zigzag stitch when sewing elastic directly to fabric . This allows the stitches to stretch along with the elastic and prevents thread breakage . <p> Over time , elastic loses its original stretch and recovery . To reduce this problem , stretch the elastic a couple of times before cutting/sewing . Stretching prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will have a more accurate fit to start with . <p> Store elastic out of direct light , especially sunlight ; extended light and heat affects its lifespan . Many people store elastic by wrapping it around cardboard rolls , but be careful to not stretch the elastic as you wrap it around . <p> 02 Section <h> Dyeing Elastic <p> Elastic is different from natural fibers , but dyeing it can be just as easy . <p> As I mentioned , elastic is made with rubber or stretchable synthetic cores and is a combination of rubber with polyester , cotton , or nylon . The most common type of elastic is nylon , and it is the one I used for this demonstration . <p> Nylon is a synthetic fiber , and it can be dyed with either acid dyes or disperse dyes . Chemist and dye artist Paula Burch writes in her nylon dyeing FAQ , " Both of these types of dye require the application of heat to fix the dye to the nylon , so be sure the item you are dyeing can withstand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She points out , " This is a problem for nylon/Lycra blends , as the spandex fiber is heat-sensitive , made from polyurethane fiber . Use acid dyes on these blends , and carefully avoid stressing the fabric while it is hot , such as by twisting or stretching . " <h> Acid Dyes <p> Acid dyes are often used on wool and animal fibers but , according to Paula Burch , can also be used to easily dye nylon . The chemist cautions that you should not expect the same results when mixing colors that you get on silk or wool . <h> Fiber Reactive Dyes <h> All Purpose Dyes <p> " Most all purpose dyes , such as Rit dye and Dylons Multipurpose dye , contains two kinds of dye , mixed together direct dye which does a fair job of dyeing cotton , and leveling acid dye which will dye both wool and nylon , " Burch writes . Because the direct dye portion does not work well with nylon , it makes sense to simply use an acid dye . <h> How to Dye using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stockpot <p> Spoon <p> Salt <p> White vinegar <h> Step 01 <p> Fill stockpot with enough water to allow elastic to move freely . Bring water to a boil , then reduce heat so it is just simmering . Remember that extreme heat damages the quality of elastic . You can use a thermometer to accurately gauge the temperature , but I eyeball how the water is simmering . From my experience , barely a simmer does n't ruin the elastic . <p> Note : Be sure to use a stockpot and utensils that are specifically for dyeing . Dyes contain harsh chemicals , and even if you wash afterwards , there could still be traces left . <h> Step 02 <p> Dissolve dye and a pinch of salt in water . The amount of dye needed depends on the amount of elastic you have and the opaqueness of color you want . Start off small , adding half a spoonful or so . Dip a sample of elastic in to test the color . Keep in mind that you 're only dipping it in for a minute or so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a lot darker ) , but this is a good gauge to see if you are in the right color family . Continue to add dye until you reach the color you want . If you get a color that is too opaque , add more water to dilute . <h> Step 03 <p> Wet elastic , then add to dye bath . By wetting , you will help the elastic pick up the dye when it is put into the pot . Stir occasionally for ten minutes . Add vinegar to the dye bath at a ratio of 3 Tablespoons per quart of water . Simmer for another ten minutes , continuing to stir . <h> Step 04 <p> Allow to gradually cool , usually about an hour or so . Sometimes , I leave it longer to help the dye set . As you can see , each elastic will dye a different shade , even if they 're in the same dye bath . While the strap elastic became a dark green , the wide elastic became the lightest shade . This is just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the fun part ! <h> Step 05 <p> Rinse elastic until water runs clear , then hand wash or wash on delicate cycle in a machine to remove any remaining dye . Do not put elastic in the dryer " this will ruin it . Let it hang to dry . <h> Step 06 <p> Use elastic in intended project . You can use hand dyed elastic in bras , underwear , camisoles , or anywhere else that elastic will be a highly visible part of your garment .

Emails with no reply , promises to call me back not materializing . <p> When it became clear that I was n't going to get any answers , even from quality providers , I set about finding out if there was a better way . That is when I stumbled on the Fibershed project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric would help me understand the supply chain . I hoped that then I would be better equipped to ask the right questions of fabric made further afield . <p> Photo by Kerry Bardot . <p> With scant research and a large dose of naivety , I decided to set myself the challenge of making an outfit entirely sourced within 500 kilometers , and I gave myself one year to do it . I did n't think it could be that hard . I sent an open invitation for people to join me , and thankfully , not everyone thought I was crazy . A small group of #sewcialists and I set to work sourcing local fabric around the globe . <p> I did n't think it could be that hard , but it turned out I had a lot to learn . <h> Sourcing Local Textiles <p> In southwest Australia , my Fibershed , I had my hopes pinned on two indie textile companies , selling hemp and silk . Two site visits later , I realized with a sense of dread that no fabric , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmed and milled in China , and the silk cocoons were sent to Bangladesh and made up just 5% of the silk cloth produced . While both of these companies provided great information on their supply chains , I was committed to the task of finding something local , making something uniquely west Australian . <p> It became apparent that this was going to be a challenge . I switched to Plan B. I worked backwards starting directly from the raw suppliers , to see how far along the supply chain I could get before things moved overseas . For instance , the silk cocoons were sent directly to Bangladesh , so I would either have to work with the cocoons directly or find someone else who knew how to . I also found a micro mill that processed local alpaca , but there were no local spinning mills for wool , so now I needed to find hand spinners . Fellow participant Sue also found barramundi leather available in small , expensive lots . <p> Each sewist 's particular Fibershed dictated the fibers available to them . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alpaca , and cotton . Mari , Tasha , Jess , and Helen ( left to right ) . <p> Finding all these sources turned out to require a knack of sorts . And it was a similar experience across the globe . There are small quantities of information on the web , but the real information came from local textile aficionados . The ladies and gentlemen of the local hand weavers , dyers , and spinners groups , the university and college textile groups , the local textile associations , and the local fiber artisans ; all of these people have a wealth of information that is best shared over a cup of tea . I learned that there use to be a flax mill in our Fibershed ! I learned that it had not been that long since the large woollen mills had closed down and moved offshore . I learned about little shops that only sell local yarn , spun by local spinners . I am finding that talking to more people leads to discovering more , and the learning process keeps on going . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Europe . Everyone discovered that the information they needed came from the ground up , from talking directly to the farmers and mills , or to someone who had done this step for you . As a result , the project has created a wealth of information on local supplies , something that I hope to find a neat way to capture in future years . <h> What Do You Do When There Is No Local Fabric ? <p> Photo by Kerry Bardot . <p> The next stage was to identify exactly how I would turn the fiber we had found into textiles and clothing , and how to do this in a year . I knew I wanted to create flexible pieces that would work for my wardrobe , and I had also decided at the very beginning that I would take more notice of the natural environment around me so that every design decision would be informed by my locality . I took photographs and learned plant names . I grew up here but I suddenly had fresh eyes . My Instagram account really changed to reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several separates : a vest , a skirt , and a top . <p> To make these three garments , I had silk cocoons , alpaca yarn , handspun wool yarn , and wool roving to work with . Also , when I started this project , I had some experience with a sewing machine , rudimentary hand sewing skills , and very rudimentary knitting skills . <p> First , it became obvious to me that I had to learn to knit . And quickly ! I got some moral support and began learning in February , where I worked my way through some simple patterns . In April , thinking I had plenty of time , I decided that cables could n't be that hard and dove right in with my handspun wool . Fast forward to August , two thirds of the way through the challenge , and my cables were slowly melting into a lumpy mess . Considering I had yet to complete a single garment , I knew that I needed to reassess my entire plan , and fast . <p> Luckily for me , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by this point we had become a little team . The other three had all been honing their felting skills , and I could see that felting might be a quick , satisfying win . Perhaps I would n't be naked at the end of the year . Sue helped me felt my wool roving into a lovely piece of fabric , and I worked out how to create holes in the fabric that were traced from bunches of gumnuts . It felt amazing to be holding a piece of Western Australian fabric in my hands at long last . I 'd finished my first garment , the vest ! <p> The first completed garment , a vest made from wool felt , awaits the completion of its companion garments . <p> Frustrated with knitting , I turned my attention instead to learning to weave . Yes , with just four months of the challenge left , I decided to learn another new skill ! Because clearly I am crazy . By now , the project had turned from something I was casually dabbling in every now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had the most generous instructor , Sue Greig from the Guild , who helped me warp up my wool and set me on my way with a four-shaft loom . After some dedicated sessions in October , with just two months to go , I cut two whole meters of hand-dyed , handspun , hand-loomed herringbone twill from my loom and I beamed ! Another piece of fabric ! <p> Right from the beginning of the challenge , I had fallen in love with the black swan , endemic to my Fibershed. - When I bought the black alpaca I specifically thought that it represented the black swan , and I remained stubborn about having a knitted garment as part of my outfit . Therefore , in November , with the clock ticking down , I reluctantly returned to knitting , this time with a much simpler pattern , and completed the trifecta . I had successfully turned wool and alpaca into fabric by knitting , felting , and weaving . <h> How Do You Find Local Color ? <p> The range of local colors available to sewists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; left ) , Nicola ( UK ; center ) , and Ute ( Germany ; right ) . <p> I love color . Bright , bright color . However , before I started this challenge , I did not realize the environmental impact of the synthetic dye process . Synthetic dyes , more often than not , contain heavy metals , known and suspected carcinogens , and cause major problems for local waterways . I was keen to find a color extract from nature that was bright and would pop , and which would not harm the environment or be a health risk . <p> Again , talking to local experts was critical . I met many wonderful people working in this area and tested over 20 local plant parts to see what color I could get on my handspun wool . As part of the process I found myself learning to identify native plants ( which is particularly challenging when it comes to eucalypts ! ) . I also learned that handspun wool does not take to dye very well , due to its high lanolin content , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving it a gentle wash in locally-made olive oil soap . <p> I also found I was restricted by the amount of plant material available for each type of plant and when it flowered . The two colors I was most happy with were a brilliant yellow from a local weed , sour sob , and a lovely light blue extracted from Indigofera Australis with the help of local lime and honey . The indigofera flowered too late in the year for me to use , so I decided to go with the yellow . I used the white and yellow to create the twill pattern in my handwoven fabric . The white and yellow represented our soil , since we basically live on top of sand dunes , and the herringbone weave represented the waves in the sand as well as the birds in flight . <p> As to that lovely blue " never fear , it will appear in my wardrobe next year ! <p> Many of the sewists working in the Australian Fibershed opted for a natural palette . Carolyn Smith ( left ) ; Sue ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do You Sew with No Notions ? <p> I had learned through this process not to take anything for granted . Turning our fabric into clothing should have been the easy part , right ? Wrong . <p> In June , halfway through my challenge , I realized that no thread or notions are made in our Fibershed ! So we had to design to this constraint . It took me until August , when I had my major rethink , to hit upon a solution . All the stitching was done with handspun wool or hand-reeled silk , rendering my sewing machine useless . I used felt to face and finish the seams of my skirt . This was not ideal due to its bulkiness , but it does give a lovely pop to the skirt hem . I also designed the tops to have no closures . Finally , I realized I could make local clay buttons to hold my skirt together . Even then , it took me another month to source the clay , and another month to finish making them ! In late November I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut-out skirt , silk , and wool thread , as well as my knitting . No machine ; just me and my hands . I sat and worked for two days straight , and by the end I had myself an outfit ! <p> Nicki 's final outfit was made of local wool , alpaca , silk , clay , and dye from the local weed sour sob . Photo by Kerry Bardot . <p> Other ingenious approaches used by participants were Sue 's historically-inspired corset , complete with i-cord ribbons , and Carolyn 's use of a whittled a stick to make a closure for her cardigan . <h> Reflections <p> As it turns out , this project was a lot more than just sourcing local fabric , it required a lot of creative thinking and adaptation , an invaluable skill on a planet with finite resources . <p> As consumers of textiles , I believe that if we want answers , we need to start asking questions of retailers . This year I am continuing to focus on creating local garments , and have opened up the challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textiles with known supply chains .

The lovingly stitched details speak of both hard times and creative ingenuity . Constructed from repurposed materials , adorned with pretty details , and restitched as they aged , these two garments represent a truly frugal style . <p> For many rural women in the 1920s and 1930s , a store-bought dress was a luxury ; most clothing was made at home . Flour and feed sacks provided dressmaking material for many of these women and their families . Soon , manufacturers caught on and began intentionally courting home sewers by developing bright colors and cheery patterns , using the design of the sack as a selling point to entice female consumers . This trend continued into the 1940s and beyond . <p> Feed sacks were used to make practical clothing and household goods , and floral patterns were particularly popular for house dresses and nightgowns . The left dress is an example of a garment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress was most likely worn to bed . <p> Bias tape made from another fabric was used to finish the edges and create feminine swirls . Like the rest of the gown , these details were stitched by hand . Small patches of fabric were added later to cover worn areas , demonstrating the " make do and mend " attitude of the era . <p> Bias tape was also used to form ties at the waist , which were sewn in place with a few stitches . The tape is unfinished and badly frayed . These ties , along with four pintucks at each side , provide some waist shaping to an otherwise shapeless gown . <p> The hem of this gown is also finished with bias tape , this time in a scalloped pattern . These details helped the sewer personalize an otherwise very simple look . <p> A close look at this stitching reveals both a loving attention to detail and charming mistakes .

A chain stitch maintains the elasticity of the waist . The loops of the chain stitch allow the stitch to stretch much more than a straight stitch would , which prevents thread breakage as the garment goes over the shoulders or hips . <p> Buttons at the front of the dress fasten the straps , making this dress easy to get in and out of . This may have been designed with breastfeeding in mind , as the comfortably gathered waist and accessible closure would make it useful for a new mother nursing an infant .

It may be hard to believe , but I actually prefer to shop for fabric online . I get to stay at home , drink some wine , wear some footed pajamas , and still have unlimited options right at my fingertips . It can be a bit daunting at times since you might be taking a gamble , but the rewards are definitely worthwhile . <p> Not all fabric stores offer the same resources and tools , so I like to use a few different techniques depending on where I am shopping . <p> The best way to know exactly what you are purchasing is by ordering swatches . Many sites offer swatches for sale , typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordering several yards or if the fabric is expensive , the extra $1 is always worth it . Ca n't order a swatch ?

Be wary of fiber content ; often it can offer telltale signs of whether or not it will work for your project . It pays to have a comprehensive understanding of both fiber and substrates . <p> In school , we were required to buy swatch books like this one .

You can easily check your swatch book to get a hands-on feel for the fabric .

Just as you would in a store , always check the width of the fabric to ensure you are purchasing the correct amount for your project . I once thought I was getting a bargain on muslin at $1.50/yard ( the width was not mentioned in the product description ) , but it turned out to be about 28 " wide ! I went through it in no time and did not repurchase it . <p> Fabric Expert is also a great place to browse fabric resources .

This can be really helpful when trying to gather more information about how a fabric will behave and drape in garment form . <p> It is always a good idea to check local sources that are a little untraditional for fabric shopping . I have found many great bargains on fabric at thrift stores . Yardage is typically hanging up with sheets and table cloths , or rolled up with pillowcases .

@@36822676 @5822676/ <h> My Ready-to-Wear Fast <p> What I learned from eliminating ready-to-wear from my wardrobe for six months . By Addie Martindale . <p> In late August of 2013 , I made the decision to stop buying or wearing ready-made clothing for 6 months . My apparel construction students inspired this abrupt decision for me . They frequently asked me why I did not make my own clothing . I never really had a good answer for them . It was n't like I never made clothing for myself but if I did it was typically limited to special occasions . <p> So there I was on August 29th , at the inception of my handmade clothing journey , with only 8 handmade garments in my closet . To reduce temptation and increase the likelihood of sticking to my commitment , I packed up all of my ready to wear ( RTW ) clothing that was off limits for the next six months and put it all in storage . I did make a few exceptions , as I was packing , to allow myself to wear ready-to-wear underwear/hosiery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , it was exciting ! The pressure and excitement of having something different to wear kept me motivated . <p> Over the next few days I made 2 tops , a skirt , and a dress to fill out my closest a bit . At the time my teaching schedule was 3 days a week , so I only had pressure to look good on those days . In the weeks that followed , I sewed every Sunday night for at least 3 hours . That allowed me to produce one or two new garments per week . Some weeks , I was n't able to sew any garments for myself . Half way into my challenge , I hit a wall . I was ready to give up , but I just could not stand the thought of letting myself or my students down . <h> The Result <p> The completion of the six months actually snuck up on me . It took me a week or two to decide where I would go with my wardrobe from there . At that point , I had sewn myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirts , 9 dresses and tunics , 20 assorted tops , and 2 cardigans . I was so comfortable now with the process that I decided to continue to make all of my new clothing . I continued to make the exception to allow non-handmade undergarments/hosiery and shoes to be a part of my wardrobe . <p> I retrieved a few of my RTW boxes from storage to add back to my wardrobe . I went through each piece , tried it on for fit and donated every piece that I did not truly love and feel great in . The donation pile was twice as big as the pile of clothes I wanted to keep . It was quite liberating when I dropped that box off at my local charity shop . I also allowed myself to start buying vintage pieces again . Ironically enough , the majority of vintage clothing I have bought since have been handmade pieces . <h> What I Learned <p> When I started this adventure , I saw it just as a personal challenge . I did not chronicle every day or make detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even take a picture . My life just really did not allow for that . On days in the classroom I left my house at 5am and got home after 6pm . It became something that fit seamlessly and organically within the confounds of my lifestyle . I did not even really think about how I was changing in this process or better yet how the process was changing me . It was n't until the 6 months was up that I realized all that I had learned and how much my perspective had changed due to my handmade wardrobe . <p> I have noticed since I have been sewing my own wardrobe I have stopped comparing my appearance as much to other women . When someone can not be wearing the same thing as you are it is hard to compare yourself . You can not think she looks better in those ( insert brand ) jeans than I do . When you do n't dress like someone else there is not as much pressure to be like someone else . <p> Through this process I realized what type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself a garment , whether you drafted the pattern yourself or not , you are going to be sure that it is something you really love before you invest your time . I began to get a sense of what I truly wanted to wear and what worked well with my lifestyle instead of trying to force clothing someone else chose for me into my life . <p> I discovered that I really like looser shaped tops , fitted pants , and I love dresses . I feel completely different yet more like myself in these types of clothing and it is quite liberating . <p> Despite being well educated on the fashion industry , the impact of my consumption did not resonate with me until I began making my own clothing . In the modern , western world we can easily forget what goes into making our clothes and the conditions in which the garment workers endure . The majority of people have a wear-it-once fast fashion line of thinking . We can all lose sense of the processes when fashion apparel is so readily available and cheaper than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , it 's easy to forget how valuable time is . You spend your days chasing kids , going to work , coming home to do household chores , participating in recreational activities ( should you have the time ) , and rarely allowing yourself time to slow down and look at the process . <p> Sewing a garment forces you to slow down to focus on the steps , the details , the time , and the entire creative process . When you cut , sew , finish , hem , and press your way through a garment , it reminds you of the value of time , specifically the value of your time . In turn , this will help you to appreciate and recognize the value of others ' time as well . <p> Measuring and evaluating my body mathematically has taught me to accept my body . Through this process I developed a way of separating my body size or shape from who I really am as a person . The idea of creating great fitting , comfortable clothing for my body was quite freeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following someone else 's pattern . You no longer have to worry about fitting into a predetermined shape or set of measurements .

@@36822691 @5822691/ <h> How to start a small clothing brand <p> Sadie Roberts of Tradlands offers her experience building a US-made clothing label from the ground up . <p> Starting a clothing company is no easy feat , especially when you 're committed to producing in the United States . Clothing is manufactured so quickly and cheaply today that it may seem nearly impossible to compete with the imported products available at large retail chains . <p> But Sadie Roberts and her partner Jeremy have created a small label that has seen incredible success over the last few years despite this . Their company is called Tradlands , and they produce classic menswear-inspired shirting that 's made to fit women . Theyve found success as a small business not by competing on price or trendiness , but on quality , service , and a deep awareness of who their customers are . <p> You 'll hear Sadies story in her own words this month on Seamwork Radio . Here , she shares eight lessons learned from creating and growing her domestic clothing line . <h> 1 . Set clear goals . <p> Everyone starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its easy to get swept away in other peoples markers of success instead of your own . This problem can be exacerbated by social media . <p> " I think there 's often a comparison game where people see a brand or see a person in the media and you think , Oh , I wish my life could be that way . ' " Sadie thinks this could lead to false ideas about what you really want , and what it takes to get there . " I always think that when you see people post pictures on Instagram and then what it actually looks like in the background is totally different . Its like having your home fixed up because you 're going to be having photographs taken of it . It just always looks a lot different on the inside . " <p> Sadie and Jeremy , founders of Tradlands <p> Having your own goals from the beginning helps you navigate the temptation to compare . For Sadie , her goal has always been " freedom to do work we love , to spend time together , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love through traveling . " Having this goal from the beginning has allowed her to step back and recognize when the hard work has paid off , rather than always looking towards the next milestone and never feeling satisfied . <h> 2 . Find a problem to solve . <p> One of the first things Sadie learned when starting Tradlands was how to become a problem solver . She says that this is the first mental leap she had to make in order to become an entrepreneur . <p> She and Jeremy began their business by trying to find a problem that they believed that they could solve . Because Jeremy is a photographer , their first idea was to create camera bags . But she says they felt stuck on it , and something did n't  quite feel right . <p> Sadie realized that she herself had a problem that needed addressing . She had difficulty finding shirts that were simple , classic , durable styles made for women instead of men . <p> " Like a gingham shirt , a gray and white gingham . It does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , its a pretty classic piece . But if you go to the womens side , you do n't  really see that same classic styling very often . It often will have just something on it that makes it not simple in its concept , its something that 's trendy at the time or its some extra print or some added bedazzling or something . " <p> She thought other women might sense this problem too . It became the basis of their business . <h> 3 . Connect with others <p> Sadie has learned to be brave when it comes to reaching out to others for help . Shes found that connecting to other people who run similar businesses has been extremely valuable , as long as its done with respect and politeness . <p> " At the very beginning , I was always terrified to send e-mails to people and now I 'm pretty fearless . Because what Ive found is the worse they can do is say " no " or they do n't  respond to your e-mail . But I have n't really had anything terrible come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a compliment and telling them why I think they 're great and then asking them if they have a couple minutes to share to talk to me . " <p> Of course , some people might not have the time or feel the need to share . " I 've found that not everybody wants to talk about what they 're up to honestly . But if you can find a few people that do , it makes life so much easier . " <h> 4 . Plan the Features . <p> The first thing Sadie and Jeremy did was to decide on the features they wanted their shirts to have . They purchased shirting that they felt was right for them and well-made , and then began to pick the features they would bring to their first line . Planning features involves research , sketching , and sometimes even sampling . <h> 5 . Get the fit right . <p> After theyd decided on features , the next thing to master was the fit . They began making samples and hiring fit models to try them on . Fit models are specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is preferable to a dress form because you can see how the samples move with the body , and the models can give you feedback on comfort . <p> Sadie and Jeremy decided to work on a universal fit , meaning a fit that would accommodate the most women in their market . But they hope to branch out into more specific types of fit in the future , such as tall and petite . <p> " We tried our shirts on as many people as we could and tried to get the best , most honest feedback about what we were doing , " Sadie says . " That took months and months and months of testing and trying and retrying and refitting . " <h> 6 . Find factories . <p> The biggest challenge in starting a small self-funded company like Tradlands is finding a manufacturer to work with . " Our first run of shirts was 120 shirts , " Sadie says . " And that 's very small and its very hard to find people that are willing to do that . " For a factory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into multiple colorways , is a lot of effort for not a lot of payoff . <p> But Sadie did find a manufacturer willing to work with her . Eventually , she was able to increase quantities , which opened up more options . " Sometimes I think at the beginning you have to find wholl work with your small quantities when you 're just starting out , unless you have funding and you 're going to out and make five thousand units to start . " <h> 7 . Learn how to sell . <p> Once Tradlands produced their first run of shirts , they had a new challenge : selling them . <p> " At the beginning we were very naive . We thought we would put a product out there and just people would come buy it . Right ? Well just put it on the Internet and people will find it. But that 's not how it works . " She had to learn how to approach bloggers and others in the media , how to take different types of product photos , and how to get the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn the nitty gritty of selling online . For that , Sadie recommends Shopify , which she says is up-to-date , easy to use , and has great customer service . <h> 8 . Stay in touch with your customers . <p> Finally , and perhaps most important , Sadie advises you to stay in touch with your customers and let them know who you are . She believes in keeping a human touch in business , and letting people now how much you care about the product you 're creating and the experience they 're having . <p> All through the process , Tradlands kept the customer in mind . From the initial problem solving phase all the way through to getting the product into someones hands , Sadie tries to show how much they care . <p> " We often tell our customers that , that well say , " Thanks for letting us do what we love every day . We truly cant do it without you . " Because that 's not a lie , we absolutely cant . I really feel that way and I feel so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knowing our first names .

@@36822698 @5822698/ <h> Preparing the Dye Bath <p> Now that you have a plan , wash your fabric or garment so that it is clean of any oils or starch and ready to evenly accept the color of the dye . Put on a dust mask and gloves , and prepare your dye bath according to its instructions . I use procion dyes ( I find the colors to be truer to the swatch and often more intense than craft store dyes ) but do note this requires mixing dyers salt and soda ash into the dye bath , as well as the procion pigment ( some procion instructions will have you mix the soda ash in at a later stage ) . Whatever dye you use , make sure to completely mix all of the elements into the dye bath thoroughly before dipping your fabric , for even results . <p> For this project , you will mix the dyers salt , pigment , and soda ash into the bath before dipping your fabric . To do this , create a paste from the pigment and a small amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soda ash with a cup of water until it is completely dissolved . Then , in a large plastic container , mix the pigment paste , water , and soda ash mixture together . <p> Stretch the fabric taut , then dip it into the dye bath slowly and evenly along the bottom edge , starting so that only a very short section of fabric contacts the dye . In order to make sure that you get that dramatic fade , you will be dipping the fabric very slowly " over the course of at least 20 minutes or so . <p> Dip your fabric slowly and evenly , keeping it parallel to the dye bath . <h> Watercolor Technique <p> A soft , watercolor-like version of dip-dye with many varied results . <p> Wet your fabric , then submerge it into the dye bath only up to the point where you want the solid color to end , letting the remainder hang off the lip of the bath .

These choices will result in entirely different patterns on your finished piece . <p> If you want your results to be more erratic , bunch up the fabric like a ponytail instead of dipping it along an even line . Alternatively , flattening the fabric against the edge of the dye bath container will also produce more irregularities in the finished yardage . Wait the specified time for a tub-dye ( I usually wait 20 minutes or so ) . Periodically you should gently agitate the fabric in the dye bath to make sure the full-color portion dyes evenly . <p> A closeup of a jellyfish-like variation . <p> Then remove the fabric by carefully pulling it out of the dye bath straight up , holding the un-dyed portion of the fabric up while you rinse it ( i.e. , rinse the dye down along the fabric that was dyed , not up through the un-dyed portion ) . This will help to avoid dye spots on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash and dry your fabric . <h> Dip-Dye Technique <p> Dip-dye creates a simple , two-tone look with a soft line where the dye color meets the un-dyed fabric . This detail looks lovely placed along the hems of blouses and dresses . <p> Using clean , dry fabric , submerge yardage into the dye bath only up to the line that will become your dye-edge . Suspend the remainder of the fabric vertically above the bath , not letting the undyed portion touch the edge of the dye bath . Keep in mind that the line of color will mirror how the fabric is contacting the dye bath . If you want a straight line , be sure the fabric is evenly stretched and meets the dye bath consistently in a straight line . If the fabric is bunched up and meets the dye bath in a sort of wiggle , your dye line will also wiggle . <p> Bunched fabric results in an uneven dye-line : beautiful if intentional , frustrating if unintentional . <p> Periodically you should gently agitate the dyeing fabric to prevent uneven color . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tub-dye . Next , carefully lift the fabric from the dye bath and rinse it by wetting from the top ( un-dyed ) area down , so as not to dye the un-dyed portion . <p> A variation on this technique is to repeat the instructions above with a different color dye on the un-dyed portion of the fabric , leaving a small line of un-dyed fabric between the two colors.

How on earth is that possible ? So here are some tips on how you can employ this in your travels as well . <p> Whether I 'm traveling to a far away land , or simply to another city within the United States , I try to pack a compact bag of garments that work together to create a capsule collection . Last year , I took the time to work through the Wardrobe Architect series , and I applied the lessons I learned to both my daily and travel wardrobe . Here are my 10 tried and true tips for packing the perfect travel wardrobe . <h> 1 . Consider color <p> You do n't have to pack all black to ensure your pieces will work together , but it will be much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items you pack work well together . <h> 2 . Layer your pieces <p> I try to pack a series of items that can layer for cool days , or be stripped down for warmer ones . Most clothes that will keep you warm are bulky , so consider a series of layers instead of one big sweater . <h> 3 . Dual-duty footwear <p> Likely , you will be walking a bit on your travels , and nothing takes up space quite like shoes , so do what you can to double up and wear the same shoes for both casual and dressy situations . <h> 4 . Travel in bulk <p> Want to take that big wool fisherman 's sweater and those knee-high boots ? Those two items alone can take up half a suitcase ! But if you are dead set on bringing a bulky item , wear those items on the plane when you 're traveling to save your luggage space . Remember though : you 'll need to repeat that on the way home , too ! <h> 5 . Prepare for buying <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time , I might buy an item or two , so I know that packing up to leave will be a lot harder than when I packed to go on my trip . Anticipating this , I bring along a flat folding nylon bag that I can use to pack up things I bought to bring home . <h> 6 . Beauty in basics <p> Much like footwear , think about bringing along classic wardrobe basics that can easily go from a casual setting to a nicer one . A black wrap dress or classic white button-up shirt can be worn in a number of situations and will go the distance on your trip . <h> 7 . Dresses vs. separates <p> An argument for packing dresses over separates is that it takes multiple separates to create an outfit , and it takes only one dress to do the same . So consider dresses when you 're packing . In the same space it takes to pack up one pair of jeans and a shirt , you can fit a handful of shift dresses , giving you way more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You might love that dress with a full 1950s-style gathered skirt , but that amount of volume eats a lot of luggage space ! I love traveling in shift dresses because they take up such little space , and always have me feeling pulled together . <h> 9 . Ace accessories <p> In real life , I am pretty minimal with my accessories , but when I travel , I always make sure to pack a few scarves for a range of situations . A large wool scarf can keep you warm when you 're out and about , but also serve as a blanket when you 're flying . Similarly , a cotton scarf can be used to cover yourself in the heat of the hot sun , as well as in ancient buildings that require you to cover your body for religious modesty . <h> 10 . Be forgiving <p> In the end , you ca n't possibly think of every situation , and it 's okay if you realize along the way that you need something you did n't bring .

Planning is one of my favorite parts of sewing ! The best way to design a color-blocked garment " or any garment for that matter " is to start with a sketch . Luckily , this type of sketching does not require strong drawing skills . Technical drawings are the backbone of any design and can serve as a roadmap throughout execution . Begin by printing out the garment flats . I like to print several copies so I can experiment to find just the right look . <p> When designing your garment , consider the existing style lines . Also consider how new style lines might affect the construction of the piece . For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you may want to practice sewing reverse corners with a stretch stitch or serger before sewing the real deal . <p> Style lines also create new fitting possibilities . Adding a seam at the waist makes it easy to shorten a garment on the fly , and adding princess-like style lines presents an opportunity for additional shaping . <h> Choosing Your Fabric <p> Once you select your design , the next step is to choose complimentary fabrics . When creating color-blocked knitwear , it is essential for all fabrics to be similar in weight as well as in stretch percentage . <p> The Ariane bodysuit requires fabric with a 4-way stretch of at least 25 percent . This means that your fabric should have the ability to easily stretch from 10 inches to 12 1/2 inches , along both the length and width . <h> Play with Texture <p> Texture is a great way to add interest to any garment . Try using fabrics like stretch lace or mesh for a flirty transparent detail . By backing sheer fabrics with a contrasting color , you can play with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIP <p> Use landmarks like the center front and waist notch to help guide you . <h> Step-by-Step <h> Step 01 <p> Begin by drawing your desired style lines using a French curve or ruler . <h> Step 02 <p> Transfer grainlines to contrast pieces . <h> Step 03 <p> Cut along the new style line . <h> Step 04 <p> Add seam allowances to the new style lines . <h> Step 05 <p> Repeat steps 1-3 on the back of the garment . If your front and back style lines meet at the side seam , be sure to measure them first . This ensures that all seams will line up . <h> Sewing Notes <p> Once you have created your modified pattern pieces , you can get sewing ! Cut all pattern pieces out of the desired fabric and then assemble the color-blocked pieces with right sides together . For instance , if you are adding a waist seam to the front and back of Ariane , assemble both the front and back pattern pieces in their entirety , before sewing the front and back together . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circumference of the body or run at a dramatic diagonal .

@@36822749 @5822749/ <h> The Secret Lives of Looms <p> Learn everything you need to know about the structural properties of fabric from hand weaving . By Tasha Griffith . <p> When my grandmother taught me how to weave , I had an epiphany about how grainlines and bias impact garment sewing . Suddenly , I understood why it 's so important to match grainlines , why you can get away with cutting some pieces cross-grain but not others , and why the same pattern , if made up in fabrics that are cut in different directions , will result in garments that behave so differently . My garments began to hang better , and I learned several tricks for compensating for fabrics that are off-grain . <p> When I started teaching sewing , I took this little loom with me to help my students understand the importance of grainlines . Once you connect the weaving process with the final fabric , you will understand enough about woven fabrics to make better garments . <p> This tiny loom was sold as a toy in the 1950s and has miniature versions of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> The Weaving Process <p> Understanding the weaving process is the first step towards learning about fabric properties . <p> Fabric starts with the warp . The threads that form the lengthwise grain of the fabric are called the warp threads . These threads are tied onto the loom before weaving begins , and are held taut throughout the weaving process . The warp threads pass through heddles , which can lift specific threads as a group . <p> In weaving , the crosswise threads are called the weft ( also called the woof , especially in older sources ) . Woven fabric forms as the warp and weft interlock to hold the threads in place . The weaver ( or the machine in a modern factory ) uses the heddles to raise certain warp threads so that there 's a path between them for the weft to pass through . <p> The weft threads are wound on a shuttle ( the weaving equivalent of a bobbin ) to make them easy to handle as they 're passed back and forth through the warp threads . <p> In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thread is raised . When the weft passes through , it has the same effect as the weaving you may have done as a child where you used a needle to weave yarn over-under-over-under a warp , but this is much more efficient . <p> The beater tamps the new weft thread against the fabric-in-progress . By moving the heddles in the opposite direction before the weft passes back through , the opposite warp threads are raised , locking each pass of the weft in place and forming the structure of the fabric . <p> The selvedges are the lengthwise edges of the fabric . As the weft is passed back and forth , it encloses the threads on either side of the warp , forming an integrated edge that wo n't unravel . In many commercial fabrics , slightly different threads are used for the selvedges , which can help keep the sides of the fabric taut as its woven . <h> Warp , Weft , and Bias in Finished Fabric <p> Learn how warp , weft , and bias can impact the drape of a garment . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain properties , and you want to take advantage of these properties in garment sewing . The warp threads become the lengthwise grain , which are the strongest and most stable threads in the fabric . Since these threads were always under tension during weaving , they wo n't stretch after the fabric is cut . Gravity pulling on a garment over time wo n't distort these threads , and they will hold the rest of the fabric structure in place . This is why most patterns have grainlines that align with the warp threads , so that the garment will hang well over the body and keep its shape over time . <h> What about patterns that are woven into fabrics ? <p> A loom with two rows of heddles and can only divide the warp threads into two groups , so it can only make variations of plain-weave fabrics . A loom with more rows of heddles can make more varied weaves . Twill , for example , requires the weft to pass over three warp threads , under one , over three , etc. , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By dividing the warp threads into four groups such that every fourth thread is in a group , it becomes fairly simple to weave a twill pattern . <p> Because the weft travels over and under the taut warp threads , it uses a little more thread over the same distance than the warp does , and so will always have just a little bit of play and stretch . Even if the warp and weft of a fabric are made from the same yarn , you can tell which is which by stretching along the grain in both directions . I 've taken advantage of this slight stretchiness when making a pattern from an existing garment . Even if the fabric is a silk , which is often woven from threads that too fine to clearly see or mark , the direction of least stretch is the direction that aligns with the warp threads . <p> Because the weft can stretch a bit , it is usually used across the body rather than vertically , especially for large pieces . It is also fairly stable , so smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running vertically for contrast , or to save fabric . <p> Bias refers to any angle on the fabric that is not in line with the warp or the weft . True bias is a 45- angle between the two . If you pull on a fabric across the bias , it stretches much more than it would along the weft . This is because the warp and weft threads can slip against each other when pulled at an angle , changing their orientation from perpendicular to diagonal . <p> A garment cut with the bias direction running vertically over the body does n't have any threads running straight down it , meaning that the fabric structure can shift and stretch as needed , which can be quite flattering . That 's also the reason why it 's important to give bias garments some time to hang before hemming them . The angle of the threads can be quite different over a wide hem cut on the bias , and so the threads may shift and stretch downward at different rates in different places . <p> It can be hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bias without causing it to ripple , because once the hem is folded , the threads in the hem do n't hang at the same angle as those in the garment . Choose a very narrow hem , a faced hem , or one that is tacked down by hand rather than topstitched , so that the difference will be less noticeable . <h> Finding and Using the Grain <p> Finding the grain , checking of fabric is off-grain , and how to straighten skewed fabrics . <p> In a well-made fabric the warp and weft should be perpendicular to each other when the fabric comes off the loom , and when you are cutting and sewing it . However , many factors can cause the warp and weft to lose their perfect square shape , from uneven tension or beating during weaving , to being pulled off grain somewhere in the finishing process . Although it is not the end of the world , an uneven fabric can affect how your garment hangs , especially if you do n't realize that it 's skewed until after you cut into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even if you can not it may change the way you cut , so it 's always worth checking . <p> To check whether the warp and weft of your fabric are square , first find the straight weft grain . If your fabric has a woven pattern across the weft ( like a plaid or a check ) this is easy . For solid color or printed fabrics it 's not as obvious , but there are a few methods you can use . <p> Most woven fabric rips easily , straight across the weft . To rip the fabric , cut a snip in the selvedge , and pull from either side of it . If you bought your fabric from an old-school shop , they may have done this for you instead of cutting the yardage ! Ripping the fabric is quick and easy , but it may distort the edge , and it 's hard to rip very close to a cut edge . <p> If your fabric is delicate , or if you want to save every bit of it you can , try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line it leaves . If the edge was cut , it 's almost certainly uneven to the grain . Look for the point where the cut goes deepest into the fabric , and use a pin to lift a weft thread there and pull it . In some fabrics , you 'll be able to pull out a thread straight across the weft in one go . In others the thread will break every few inches , and you will have to do your best to find it and pull it out again . Sometimes , once the thread is out , it 's hard to see the gap it left . Try holding it up to the light , or cutting the fabric while the pulled thread gathers it just a little , so that you can see the line to cut in the puckers . Although this method is more tedious than ripping , it does n't distort the edge at all and it can be used anywhere , even to check the grain on scraps of fabric in your stash . <p> Once you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half from selvedge to selvedge . If the grain is square , the selvedges ( which are parallel with the warp ) and the weft at the ends should all line up and fold into a neat rectangle . If the grain is skewed , you 'll either be able to line up the warp or the weft sides , but not both at once . <p> The warp and weft of this sample all line up when folded , so the lengthwise and widthwise grainlines are square to each other . <p> In this sample , when the weft grain lined up straight across the width the warp is at steep angles , meaning the grainlines are skewed . <p> Sometimes it 's possible to straighten a skewed fabric by taking advantage of the fact that the warp and weft threads can move against each other when pulled on the bias . To do this , determine which corner is at the sharper angle . Usually you can tell by comparing two sides of the fabric to see which corner is narrower . Grab both sides of the narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands down on each side by an even amount , and pull again . On this little sample , I 'll move down the width of my thumb . On a full-size piece of fabric , move down one hand-width at a time , so that each part of the fabric gets stretched . <p> To move the grainlines towards square , pull straight across the bias , an even distance from the corner on both sides of the fabric . <p> On a wide fabric , you may need a friend to help you pull across the full width , since your arms wo n't stretch that far apart . Continue until you 've stretched all the fabric , all the way to the opposite corner . <p> Line the warp and weft up again , and see if they are closer to square . If stretching made a difference but the fabric still is n't quite square , try pulling across the fabric again , starting from the same corner . <p> Sometimes , perhaps due to the finishing process the fabric went through or the tightness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threads into right angles . If that 's the case , it 's most important to match the pattern 's grainlines to the warp threads , parallel to the selvedge . Do not use the weft edge as a reference if the grain is not square , because the lengthwise grainline will not be perpendicular to it , and your pieces will end up off grain from the warp . Knowing whether or not your fabric is square , understanding how to find the grain and why it 's important , will help you get the best possible results in your sewing . <p> Now that you know the properties that are built into fabric as it is woven , you can to create garments that take advantage of the strength of the grain , the slight stretch of the cross grain , or the fluid stretch of the bias . So grab that special fabric that 's been lingering in your stash ! The perfect project is just around the corner . <h> Resources <p> If you 're curious about how more complex woven patterns are made , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaving that breaks down the process .

That 's because the knit fabric was cut crosswise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to side rather than up and down .

@@36822781 @5822781/ <h> Building your Activewear Wardrobe <h> When planning upcoming sewing projects , we tend to take many options into consideration : <p> What designs interest me ? <p> Will this pattern fit my lifestyle ? <p> What alterations will I need to make ? <p> Will this fabric be suitable for the garment ? <p> Is this color or pattern attractive to wear ? <p> Some of us might also start to think about when the garment may be worn , and if , say , whether a pullover will be warm enough to be worn in winter , or if polyester might be too clingy in humid conditions . For the most part , these questions are largely either about the pattern or the fabric , but rarely are they about the activity being undertaken while it 's worn . Very few sewists actually think about the body movements involved when a garment will be worn , and it 's largely only those who encounter repetitive movements throughout the course of a day , such as a teacher continually raising her arms to write on a board , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seated position , who might notice ways in which future garments could be improved . <p> For the most part , casual wear garments do a pretty good job at allowing general movement , and even formalwear these days is designed to work well while standing , sitting , and dancing ( though let 's not forget that the traditional cocktail dress was designed to only be worn while standing ! ) . But when it comes to creating garments for exercise , movement must be considered as a priority at the beginning of the design process , and patterns and fabric may very well need to be carefully chosen in order to prevent discomfort , chafing , overheating , and most embarrassing of all , wardrobe malfunctions during the course of your exercise . <p> In this article , we 'll take a look at five common types of activities and examine the movements involved in each . We 'll also examine fabric considerations and some great pattern suggestions to get you started on building your own-sewn activewear wardrobe , no matter what gets you moving . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most challenging sport to design clothing for , due to its unique combination of high impact , repetitive motion , and high aerobic intensity . <p> The author running in her Threshold Shorts pattern . <p> Flexibility , stretch , and recovery are all important factors when considering a fabric to be worn while running . If you 'll be running for a long time or in hot and humid conditions , a breathable fabric that wicks sweat away from the body is key to feeling comfortable and dry , as well as helping to prevent chafing . In absolutely no circumstances should you use cotton fibers for running or other activities that cause you to produce a lot of sweat . Cotton will hold onto moisture , which can cool very quickly once you 're done exercising . <p> Another , more aesthetic point to consider when shopping for fabric is that running garments will ideally be close-fitting , so your chosen fabric must hold its print and opacity when stretched , or else the areas most stretched around the body will appear either faded , or even worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; otherwise , long areas , which move the most , like the knees , will become stretched out and saggy . Some people are more prone to chafing than others , but chafing can be reduced at the planning stages by altering pattern seamlines away from areas which can rub and cause problems ( like between the upper thighs or underarms ) . You can also avoid this by merely making seams as flat as possible or avoiding thick seam intersections . <p> Cotton is extremely hydrophilic , holding up to twenty-five times its weight in water , and takes an exceptionally long time to dry . If you 've ever had the misfortune of wearing jeans to a waterpark , then you know they can still be damp at the end of a day ! Once wet , cotton can lead to chafing in hot weather , or even worse , hypothermia in cold weather , which can cause death . Avoid cotton in all your activewear including socks , as it can lead to nasty blisters . <p> Even the smoothest of professional runners bounce as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from moving and becoming damaged over time should be a primary concern . For all women ( yes , even the least-endowed ) , this means wearing a sports bra , which eliminates all movement in the breast tissue . If you can see movement as you jump in front of a mirror , you need to buy a more supportive sports bra , whether it 's the traditional compression style , or the more engineered encapsulation style . Before selecting your pattern size for any activewear top , you should also re-measure your bust while wearing your sports bra , especially if you prefer the compression-style . <h> Pattern Suggestions <h> Cycling <p> Cyclists face many of the same challenges as runners " repetitive movements over long periods of time with high-cardio activity , but since speeds on a bike can reach far greater than those on foot , wind is also a major factor in choosing fabric . <p> The breeze created from cycling can be a bonus when riding in warm weather , but cycling in cold weather can result in very cold extremities if a wind-proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress in layers , with a breathable , wicking layer closest to the body , which keeps the sweat away from the skin , as well as a wind-breaking jacket or cape to keep the body heat inside . <p> Multi-sport athlete Emily Ackner . <p> Cycling is a low-impact sport , but the posture adopted in the saddle is far different than the standing position many patterns draft for . Unless you 're using a pattern specifically designed for cycling or another seated pursuit ( such as horseback riding ) , you may find you have to adjust the pattern to fit your cycling posture . While riding , the body is largely seated , which requires an elongated center back length/rise . In addition , the arms are thrust forward to place the hands on the handlebars , requiring a broader back than normal . Additionally , many cyclists may subconsciously move their head forward as they ride , making the front neckline uncomfortable and requiring either a forward protruding neck adjustment , or the addition of a half zip at the neckline to allow the height to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like cyclists , equestrians are largely in a seated or semi-standing position , and can experience windchill while moving at high speeds . As such , equestrians may choose to take the same approach as cyclists when selecting fabrics , choosing breathable and wicking base layers combined with a warmer or weatherproof outer layer . <p> The Steeplechase Leggings worn in the saddle . <p> But unlike cyclists , riders ' legs remain mostly stationary , and the bounce needs of equestrians are far closer to those of runners . In terms of sports bras , equestrians should look for high impact designs in either a compression or encapsulation style that will allow the breast tissue to remain stationary , even at a gallop . <p> But riding a horse is clearly not the same as riding a bicycle , despite the similar posture , and so equestrians must also consider the needs of the saddle and tackle when thinking about garments for the lower half of the body . Unlike a bike seat , which is thin and moves in a predictable way , an equestrian may find herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse moves beneath her . Traditional riding trousers ( jodhpurs ) are made from suede , where the body comes in contact with the saddle , but modern riders can increase grip in spandex leggings by applying silicone paint or sealant in small dots or patterns around the seat and inner thigh area . Utilizing the brightly colored paints designed for slippers or socks can open up a whole new range of print and design opportunities on top of the usual fabric choices , too . <p> Some equestrians may experience chafing or irritation in the inner thigh where the leg meets the saddle , and this can be greatly reduced by choosing close-fitting pants or leggings with either flatlocked inner thigh seams or even better , no inner thigh seams at all . Traditional riding trousers have panels in the inner leg area rather than inseams for this very reason , and inserting a long panel in place of an inseam is a fairly quick pattern alteration that allows you to avoid discomfort further down the road .

Unless , of course , you 're spending it worrying whether the person next to you can see down your top as you downward dog , or whether your crotch seams can withstand the monkey pose you 've spent months achieving ! <p> The low-impact nature of yoga may mean that there are a wider variety of suitable fabrics and design styles available , but you 'll still need to consider all the movements your body goes through in an average class in order to anticipate your own garment needs . <p> Athlete Anne Bowman wearing the VNA Top pattern . <p> First , consider your own comfort : Do you prefer loose-fitting styles , or are you more at ease exercising in body-hugging clothing ?

If you 're usually in a hot and humid Bikram yoga studio , you 'll definitely want to look for breathable wicking fabrics to allow your sweat to evaporate rather than cling to you . Also consider what will happen after you 've finished working out . If you know it 'll take an hour before you can get home to shower afterwards , you 'll also need to think about a warm cover-up to keep from getting chilled as your body cools down . <p> Yoga requires the body to go through a wide range of motions , with both the arms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gussets are a great way of adding flexibility and range of motion to a pattern precisely where it 's needed most , usually either in the underarm seam to allow greater arm movement , or in the crotch seam of close-fitting leggings to allow your legs to do a split without the seam doing the same ! Either look for a pattern that incorporates a diamond-shape gusset piece , or alter your favorite pattern to increase the range of motion . Gussets are sometimes over-used in ready-to-wear activewear to disguise a poor crotch fit , so be sure to adjust your pattern to fit you as the first step before adding a gusset to increase your range of motion . <h> Pattern Suggestions <h> Climbing <p> Humans have been climbing for as long as there have been mountains to scale and cliffs to dangle from , but the modern climbing and bouldering scene has considerably risen in popularity in recent years .

Many climbing centers only offer walls up to five to six yards high , and therefore do n't require any ropes or safety harnesses to be worn over top of your clothing . This means you can wear just about any clothing that does n't impede range of motion or contain loops or wide openings , which may cause clothing to get caught on grips as you jump or fall . For such bouldering centers , you can really just concentrate on fabrics that work for the temperature of the center and allow your limbs to move freely . Like yoga , look for leggings or trousers with a crotch gusset to allow freedom of movement , or incorporate one into your own favorite casualwear pattern to make them climbing friendly . Some ready-to-wear climbing pants have gussets reaching down to the knees on either side to allow wide split motions in non-stretch fabrics . <p> The author climbing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people associate climbing with a lot of upper body and arm strength .

This technique is one of the simplest ways to create custom fabric at home . <p> One of the wonderful things about block printing is that you have absolute control over the colors , motif , and repeat of your print . This amount of control gives you a chance to create fabric that is unique to your project . <p> In this tutorial , we will share block printing basics , showing you how you can tap into your inner textile designer and make hand-printed fabrics . Whether your taste is subtle or bold , you can create an array of looks with this easy technique . <h> You 'll need : <p> Fabric <p> Wood-mounted linoleum blocks <p> Lino cutter <p> Butcher paper or newsprint <p> An apron <p> A large flat surface <p> A piece of Plexiglass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ink <p> An iron <p> Two press cloths <h> Designing <p> Before you begin your block printing project , it is important to create a design and plan . <p> A store bought stamp like this one can be used to create textural patterns . <p> If you are a novice block printer , start small with tea towels or a simple clutch like Valencia . Also , consider using a store bought stamp so you can focus on the process of block printing , rather than create a block from scratch . <p> To do this , start by sketching the design you would like to print on a piece of paper . <p> Once you are satisfied with your design , transfer it to a linoleum block . To do this , you can use transfer paper , or create your own carbon paper . By rubbing a graphite pencil on the wrong side of your sketch and then tracing your design , you can easily transfer your drawing to your linoleum block . <p> Use a lino cutter to carve away the negative space around your design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when you are done , you will have a stamp you can use time and time again . <h> Four tips for carving your block <p> Start small : Start by using your smallest carving tip to create a border around your design , then gradually build up to a larger carving tip . <p> Carve on a non-slip surface : Place your block on a non-slip surface , like a rubber mat , for more control . <p> Practice safety : Carve your block with care . This means you should always cut away from your body and hands . <h> Prepping <p> Wash and dry your fabric to remove any sizing that might interfere with your ink . <p> Cut your project pieces from your chosen fabric . Cutting your fabric before printing offers two advantages : The first is that working with smaller pieces is easier and requires less space ; the second is that cutting your fabric before printing will allow you to be more intentional with your pattern placement . <p> Lay out all of the supplies you will need to block print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ container , rubber brayer , water-based ink , the carved block , and the fabric . <p> Lastly , prepare your workspace by laying down butcher paper or newsprint , because things are about to get messy ! <h> Printing <p> Pour a small amount of ink onto a piece of Plexiglass or into a shallow container . <p> Use a brayer to roll the ink from the container onto the block . Make sure that the block is evenly coated with ink . <p> Practicing on scrap paper also allows you to refine your carved block by seeing any areas that need more definition or should be carved deeper . <p> Practice your stamping technique on a scrap piece of paper . It 's important to apply even , uniform pressure to your block . <p> Once you have perfected your technique , you are ready to move on to fabric !

If you would like a more uniform repeat , use a water soluble marking tool and ruler to mark your fabric to help create a consistent motif . <h> Setting the ink <p> Set your printed fabric aside to dry ; this can take up to two days depending on your fabric and the amount of ink used . <p> Once the ink is completely dry , use an iron to set your designs in place permanently . <p> Heat an iron to the highest heat setting your fabric will tolerate . Sandwich your printed fabric between two press cloths , and iron each piece for 3-5 minutes per side . <p> You can now sew your pattern according to the pattern instructions !

@@36822807 @5822807/ <h> Zero-Waste Manufacturing <p> Changing how we think about fabric waste , by Jessica Yen . <p> One of zero-waste fashion 's biggest challenges is changing the manufacturing processes that create so much waste . Small changes to large-scale manufacturing can have wide ripple effects . In this article , we 'll take a look at some of the fashion insiders who are tackling this by opening up new markets for their products , others who are inventing new technologies to solve an old problem . Either way , they 're part of a larger movement hoping to change the industry , and they 've come up with an idea or two that we can borrow , as well . <h> Computer Meets Loom <p> What does the future of zero-waste manufacturing look like ? Let 's take a quick peek at a couple promising technologies developed by eco-minded fashion insiders . <h> Direct Pattern on Loom <p> Direct Pattern on Loom ( DPOL ) was developed by Indian fashion designer Siddhartha Upadhyaya . Where most looms weave rectangles of fabric , DPOL connects the loom to a computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , or a bodice . The resulting pieces can then be sewn together . Because no cutting is required , no waste is generated . Who knows if this technology will ever be available for the home sewist , but it 's nice to dream about tossing those pattern weights and shears , is n't it ? <h> A Piece of Cloth <p> A Piece of Cloth ( A-POC ) is the brainchild of Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake , in collaboration with his colleague Dai Fujiwara . Both a manufacturing process and a label , A-POC knits fabric into tubes that are then seamed together in strategic places to create cavities ; multiple garments can be woven into the fabric in this way , and once the tubes come off the loom , they are snipped open with scissors to create garments . Like DPOL , A-POC makes extensive use of technology to weave finished garments instead of fabric . The key to the A-POC process is a digital Jacquard machine " instead of using it to weave patterns , it is used to embed seams . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a can of that onto a body or dress form , and you 'll begin to see how Fabrican Ltd. ' s Spray on Fabric operates . The British company found a way to bond and liquefy fibers ; once sprayed , the solvent evaporates and the fibers bond , forming a body-hugging garment . Although Spray on Fabric has been used on the catwalk , its applications are far-reaching , from health care ( the fabric is sterile and can be used as a bandage ) to environmental cleanup , as the fibers have the ability to absorb oil . This amazing technology boasts both zero cutting , sewing , and waste . <p> Sort by fabric ( linen , silk , denim , etc. ) and then create a list of patterns or projects for each one . Bottom-weight fabrics work well for sturdier projects , whereas lighter fabrics are better suited to patchwork and small , delicate projects . Remember , you can always interface or underline a lightweight fabric to give it more body . <p> Pick your battles . If you 're drowning in off-cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love the most . Or work backwards from your favorite types of projects ( bags , quilts , etc. ) and identify the fabrics best suited to those . <p> <p> Keep your secondary pattern pieces on hand when you 're cutting your main project .

Your scanning software most likely has a way to preview an image from the scanner before scanning the image . Use this feature to see different arrangements and make adjustments . <p> Keep all objects toward the center as much as possible . When a flower or stem falls off the edge of the image , it will make it more difficult to create a good-looking fabric repeat , since the edge of each image will be clearly visible . You are aiming for pure , black edges and background , so that the images can be pieced together seamlessly . <p> Petals make a nice background filler in a design . <p> Do n't  forget to scan interesting pieces and shapes , such as individual petals , groups of petals , or leaves . A mix of small and large objects can help you create a wider variety of designs later . Try scanning a small scattering of petals to place between larger flowers , for example . <h> Create a Simple Repeat <p> By now , you should have a variety of images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create a repeat . If you really want to keep your fabric simple , look through these images and choose the one that speaks to you the most . You could upload this image directly to the fabric printing service , using their interface to tile the pattern and create a design . <p> Simple repeats that include negative space between objects are easy to create . Cutting and pasting three flowers onto a black background took about 2 minutes once they were scanned . <p> Because there is enough background in the image , the final fabric design does not show obvious seams between the squared repeats . <p> If you 'd like to design your own repeat with multiple flowers , create a new image in your image-editing program of choice . Set the resolution to 150 pixels per inch and make the image as large as you 'd like . Fill the background with black . Begin cutting and pasting the scanned flower images onto the new image , arranging them as you 'd like . Leave plenty of space between the motifs . This will help camouflage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your design will not reveal the " seams " between each tile . <h> Create a Complex Repeat <p> If you 'd like to create a repeat that is packed with flowers and imagery but still appears seamless , you will need to use some of the other features available in Adobe Photoshop . If you are comfortable in Photoshop , you 'll see how easy this method is . <p> Use the offset filter in Photoshop to help you create more visually complex seamless designs . <p> When this design is placed in a basic repeat , the design is busy and seamless . <p> Create a new image . You can make it whatever size you 'd like , but be sure to make it a square . For this repeat , we created a 2000+2000 pixel image . Once again , set the resolution to 150 pixels per inch and fill the background with black . Cut and paste your images to create a more tightly packed design in the center of the image . Make it as complex as you 'd like , but do not let any part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the way you like , choose Layer &gt; flatten image . <p> Create a design in the center of your square image . <p> Use the offset filter to wrap the design around the edges . <p> Fill in the remainder of the design with more flowers . <p> Once you have your center motif complete , choose Filter &gt; Other &gt; Offset . In the dialog that appears , enter half the length and width in the horizontal and vertical fields , and set the radio button to " wrap around . " Select OK , and you will now see your image quartered and placed at the corners of the image . <p> Cut and paste more flowers to fill the center of the image . Once you 're happy with how it looks , you 're done . You now have a complex , tightly packed floral design that conceals the seams between the tiles ! This method can be used to create all kinds of repeats within Adobe Photoshop , not just from scanned images . <p> See the Resources section below if you 'd like to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Use a digital fabric printing service to bring your fabric repeat to life. - Spoonflower- offers several options for repeating patterns , including a basic repeat , half-drop repeat , or half-brick repeat .

@@36822888 @5822888/ <h> Collecting and Caring for Vintage Clothing <p> The first time I walked into Xtabay Boutique , I felt I 'd entered a vintage nirvana . Decorated in soft colors with glowing light , the racks full of the most exquisitely beautiful dresses and coats , this is the type of store where you immediately feel the unique presence of the owner . Only someone who truly cares about vintage clothing and how they make a woman feel could create a space like this . It also takes someone with skill , know-how , and a discerning eye for detail . <p> That someone is Elizabeth Gross . Liz has been buying and selling vintage clothing from the age of 18 , when she first discovered thrift shops like Value Village . " I could not believe what amazing , gorgeous things were there for very little money . Back then you could find vintage designer gowns for $4.99 ! It was a revelation and I started thrifting religiously . " <p> Liz began selling her finds to local vintage stores until she met the woman who would become her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Lush Budget who spotted her carrying a load of vintage rejects outside of a nearby store . The pair hit it off , and eventually moved from that store to a larger one called Lady Luck . Here , Liz had her first taste of success . The business not only proved to be lucrative , but was written up in publications such as Vogue . As the business grew , so did her collection of clothing . <p> When the partnership broke up , Liz opened Xtabay . In the beginning , Xtabay sold a wide range of vintage clothing . " When I first opened , we sold everything from levis to rock t--shirts to evening gowns . Our clientele was really mixed . We had a lot of weird guys lurking around in the beginning . " Over time , that focus has shifted . The shop now specializes in special occasion garments , including astoundingly beautiful vintage cocktail and party dresses . Xtabay is now the go-to shop in Portland for exquisite vintage clothing . In 2012 , they opened a bridal salon , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and antique wedding gowns . <p> The bridal salon at Xtabay <p> Over the years , Liz has learned many lessons about buying , collecting , and caring for vintage clothing . You can apply these same lessons , whether you are a collector , someone who likes to mix in vintage here and there , or even just a sewist looking to shop for inspiration . <h> Wearing Vintage Today <p> When buying pieces for Xtabay , Liz looks for three things : design , quality and relevancy . These are the same criteria you can use while shopping to help guide your own purchases , whether you 're looking for the perfect 1950s wedding gown , or even perusing the racks at a modern boutique . <h> Design <p> In some ways , evaluating design is subjective . Each of us has personal preferences about what we consider " good design , " and those preferences are what form our individual tastes . <p> Yet , there are some principles of design that remain universal , and you can train your eye to find them . Look for garments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own body type . Keep an eye on the fit , paying particular attention to any areas where the piece is straining or bunching . Persistent wrinkles in certain areas are the hallmarks of a poor fit . <p> Because vintage clothing can often be so overwhelmingly pretty , its helpful to set a few ground rules for yourself when shopping . Having a list in your mind of what works with your body and lifestyle before you shop can help you to avoid picking out beautiful dresses purely for their embellishments or prints . <p> In addition to the overall look and fit , keep an eye out for interesting and unusual details . Vintage clothing often includes fascinating construction details that are left out of modern apparel , and can be a rich source of inspiration . Bias-cut panels , unusual closures , or shaped seams and darts are just a few of the luxurious touches you might notice once you start looking closely . <h> Quality <p> In some ways , the quality of a vintage garment is easy to deduce . If its held up well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly high level . Most low quality garments from 40 or more years ago simply havent made it this far . Compare that to a modern piece fresh from the factory . Who knows whether it will even survive the first wash ? <p> The greater difficulty comes in deducing what can be fixed and what must be abandoned . In shopping for vintage , you must sometimes come to terms with the fact that certain pieces are injured beyond repair . In shopping for her store , Liz says , " Condition is very important , and a piece has to be wearable for me to want to deal with it . That means occasionally having to pass on some really incredible things . It breaks my heart sometimes . " <p> To evaluate the quality , take a look at the condition of the seams and fabric . If you notice splits or tears , think carefully about whether these flaws can be easily repaired , but also whether they will continue to crop up as the garment is worn . Also check closures , making sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look for markers of high quality , such as luxurious fabrics , linings where needed , perfect buttonholes , and patterns like stripes and plaids that match at the seams . <p> Take a particularly good look at the underarms of a vintage garment . Underarm sweat can wreak havoc on fabric , particularly if it is n't washed immediately . This can lead to areas of the garment that are not just discolored or smelly , but actually weak and fragile . <h> Relevancy <p> Finally , consider whether the garment is truly wearable . Though boutiques like Xtabay focus on gorgeous special occasion dresses , today many women enjoy wearing vintage every day by mixing it with modern pieces . Liz says that the majority of her clients prefer not to dress in head-to-toe vintage , but to weave vintage looks into their own style . <p> " They are like me in the sense that they love the ease and comfort of modern clothing but love to inject their look with some fabulous vintage pieces . I always wear vintage coats in the winter over my jeans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heels from Nordstrom and my vintage jewelry . Vintage coats and dresses are my mainstay . " <p> Consider how you might incorporate individual items of vintage with the clothing you already own , how it mixes with your personal style , and how often you anticipate wearing it . Many vintage items , such as coats , sweaters , jackets , and summer dresses , are such classics that they will never go out of style and are easy to fit into the modern wardrobe . <h> Vintage Trends <p> Buying and wearing vintage clothing is more popular than ever . But like all things fashion related , vintage clothing faces trends . What was popular five or ten years ago is no longer quite the hot ticket item . <p> Pop culture and the nostalgia it inspires plays a large role in these trends today . " A few years ago everything was Mad Men . We had a fantastic time selling Mad Men type dresses , " Liz says . " That has slowed down considerably and now people seem more interested in really old things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " As time goes by , things get harder and harder to find . That means the price of things go up . A 1950 's Ceil Chapman dress that I sold for $125 in 2005 now goes for closer to $700--800 . It has become more of a luxury item than a cheap alternative to something new . " <p> Currently , Liz notices that 1920s dresses are in high demand in the shop . With modern fashion trending towards loose silhouettes and gamine aesthetics , its easy to picture dresses from this era fitting into a modern wardrobe . <h> Vintage Trends <p> Embroidered tops <p> Mexican dresses <p> Edwardian dresses <p> 1990s dresses <p> Turquoise jewelry <p> Ethnic clothing <p> 1920s dresses <h> Caring for Vintage <p> There 's no doubt that decades-old clothing requires special care and attention . Many older pieces are made in fabrics that are no longer manufactured , or that have mostly been replaced by easy-care synthetic alternatives . <h> Washing <p> Garments made in cotton or polyester are among the easiest to wash and treat , Liz says . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way you would care for a modern piece of clothing . <p> Silks , rayons , and wools all need more attention . Most silks can be hand washed in warm water and do not require dry cleaning . Do not use harsh detergents and never apply chlorine bleach to silk , which will cause permanent damage . Its also important to treat wet silk gently . Do not ring or twist , and always blot rather than rub when spot treating . <p> Rayon can also be hand laundered , though it is more prone to shrinking or warping than silk . Rayon crepe is particularly susceptible , and should be dry cleaned to remain safe . In general , dry cleaning should be used as a last resort , as dry cleaning chemicals can be quite harsh . Liz advises to spot clean if necessary , rather than cleaning the entire garment . <p> Wool garments can be tricky to clean , and its often best to consult with a professional dry cleaner to find the best method for your particular garment . If a wool garment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method . Wool sweaters and knits are generally fine to gently handwash in lukewarm water . Woven dresses , suits , and coats often need a professional cleaning . Again , spot cleaning is a good option for treating small spots or spills . <h> Wearing <p> Use precautions to prevent the damage that can be done by sweat . While decades ago , anti-perspirants were not available and deoderants were less effective , today you can use these products to prevent further injury to these precious garments . " So many dresses get ruined by BO , " Liz says . " God help me if we lose another beautiful gown to what we call a BO bandit ! " <h> Storage <p> " Proper storage is crucial , " says Liz . " Using padded hangers helps save the shoulders on dresses . Storing things in a canvas , breathable garment bag is smart . Do not store in plastic garment bags ! " Plastic garment bags do not breathe , so odors , sweat , and damaging chemicals are trapped with your clothing . Canvas garment bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as cedar to ward off bugs . <p> If you have a piece that needs extra special care , such as a delicate and very old silk dress or a piece made from lace , Liz advises that these delicate items should be wrapped in acid free tissue paper and kept in a cedar chest . Acid-free tissue can also be used to fold items to prevent creases , or it can be stuffed into items that should retain their shape , such as shoes or hats . <p> " Vintage clothing is made to last . If you care for it properly it is an investment that will last for years to come . " <p> There is no doubt that a great deal of experience goes into collecting and caring for vintage pieces . But there 's also a great deal of satisfaction to be found in the deep appreciation of clothing from the past . " I find the fabric , design , craftsmanship , and integrity of vintage clothing so much more compelling than a flimsy piece of micro-fiber from Target , " Liz says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vintage clothing that I think speaks to a lot of women . It does to me. "

Do you think of the town you grew up in ? Your mother ? The place you currently reside ? Home is an abstract subject . What it means to me may not be what it means to you . <p> I moved away from my home town when I was 17 . Though those first years were spent on a college campus or on the couches of friends , it was then that I began to define what home meant to me .

Should I use this in place of the body measurement chart when choosing my size ? Which chart is best to use ? Thanks , Muddled by Measurements <p> Dear Muddled by Measurements , <p> The finished garment measurement charts are a great tool to use to see how much ease and length a garment will have once it is sewn up . Not sure what ease is or how to use it to your advantage ? Ease is the extra amount of room a garment has ( or lack thereof in the case of knitwear ) to allow you to live your life , including walking , eating , sitting , bending over , getting down with your bad self , etc . <p> Woven garments will always have what is known as positive ease , meaning that the finished garment measurements will be greater than your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have negative ease ( finished garment measurements that are smaller than your own body measurements ) , since knit fabrics are stretchy and forgiving .

Finished measurement charts will help you transform the same garment to be suitable for Thanksgiving dinner or " da club . " <p> Unsure of how much ease you want to aim for in your new garment ? Take out a piece of clothing from your own closet that has the same amount of ease or a similar fit to what you 're aiming for and measure at the bust , waist , and hips . <p> Pro tip : I suggest trying the garment on and carefully marking your bust , waist , and hips with safety pins to ensure the most accurate measurements are recorded .

Colette and Seamwork patterns offer not only the total garment length but also the neck-to-waist length to help with all of your fitting needs . <p> To summarize , finished measurement charts will help you choose a size based on the amount of ease . <p> Ease = finished garment measurement " your body measurement . <p> Positive ease = more room to eat . <p> Negative ease = less room to breathe . <p> Pugs and kisses , <p> Wally 185425 @qwx385425 <p> Wallis is the patternmaker behind both the Colette and Seamwork patterns .

@@36822936 @5822936/ <h> Wallys Wisdom <h> Dear Seamwork Team , <p> I am sewing a winter Camden cape with very thick wool . Heavyweight fabric always seems to give me trouble . Do you have any advice ? <p> Please help ! Bewildered by Wool <h> Dear Bewildered by Wool , <p> Sewing winter apparel can seem very daunting . The fabrics are deceptively tricky and outerwear projects are typically very involved . Yet , as many sewists know , it is extremely rewarding to create a beautiful and practical garment that can be worn each winter for years to come . Before sewing with thicker fabrics you should always be sure you are well equipped with all of the right tools . <p> The first step to sewing with wool is to pre-shrink your fabric . Wool has a tendency to shrink 2%-4% , and the easiest way to have it pre-shrunk is to take it to a dry cleaner . Sure , 2%-4% may not sound like much , but you would n't want to labor over an outerwear project for weeks only to have it shrink after dry cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the label on the bolt when purchasing . <p> One of the most important tools for sewing outerwear is your needle . You 'll need a heavy needle . I recommend starting with a 90/14 for wool and moving up if necessary . Most needles have a sewing life span of about eight hours , but I find it 's better to switch after four hours for heavy fabrics . <p> Be sure not to skimp on the quality of thread ; I know it 's always tempting to try to save a couple of bucks wherever possible when sewing an expensive garment , but you 'll regret it when the threads break or the tension is consistently off . Silk thread is quite durable and works well with wool . Always test your stitches on a scrap piece of fabric before sewing your garment , double check that you are using the appropriate stitch length , and make sure that the tension is not too tight . <p> Be diligent and press all of your seams as you go , but do n't directly iron your wool ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press cloth instead to protect your fabric . <p> Camden has several panels , which can mean bulky seams when using a heavy fabric . Consider pinking the seams to avoid extra bulk since they 'll be hidden under the lining . Lining is a necessity for any garment sewn in wool ; you would be cray to allow it to touch your bare skin all day ! If your pattern does n't include a lining you can read over this Seamwork article to learn to draft your own . <p> Lastly , it is time for the finishing touches of your Camden ! Often domestic machines will have trouble creating a buttonhole through so many layers of wool . Instead , consider bound buttonholes . I know , I know " they can seem tedious , but this technique will give you one more reason to feel proud of your me-made outerwear . <p> Pugs and kisses , <p> Wally 185425 @qwx385425 <p> Wallis is the patternmaker behind both the Colette and Seamwork patterns .

Like other activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditation , the practice of drawing can shift us out of the rut of analytical , literal thinking . This not only offers a respite from the daily grind of left-brain thinking , it also helps us see things in new ways and come up with insights we might not have otherwise . <p> In other words , the benefits of artistic practice extend well beyond the actual act of creation . Practicing creativity changes the way we think . The more you experience the shift from analytical thought to creative thought , the more often you are able to return to that state . <p> There are many ways to have a creative or artistic practice , and for you making clothing might be one of them ; it certainly is for me .

Let aromatic clouds of steam surround you on days when you need a little extra luxury or care . <p> You can use almost any essential oil or blend . Choose something with a big , delicious scent that appeals to you . You can choose a single beloved note , like jasmine , or create your own complex scent . There are a million recipes online for essential oil blends , and I 've included some ideas below , too . Lots of places also sell pre-mixed blends that take the guesswork out , if you do n't get excited by playing perfumer . <p> I do n't believe aromatherapy can do everything people claim it can , but I do believe that surrounding yourself with your favorite scents can do wonders for your mood , sleep patterns , and energy levels .
