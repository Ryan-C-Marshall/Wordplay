In a scientific experiment on the reactions to receiving gifts , only those given flowers always elicited the Duchene ( or true ) smile " and those who smiled properly still reported a mood boost three days on from the experiment . <h> 2 . Can Help You Sleep <p> Research has found flower scents can have sleep inducing properties ; Jasmine , lavender and gardenia 's scent are all proven to aid the quality and duration of sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healthy , natural sleep . <p> Sleep is so important to our health " people getting their 40 winks have longer , healthier , more active lives than those who struggle to get theirs . <h> 3 . Boost Your Health <p> Whilst flowers may not be the miracle cure for a poor diet and an inactive lifestyle , they can give us that extra little boost at our time of need and help our well-being and recovery . Flowers were found to ; reduce hospital stays , lower painkiller usage , reduce blood pressure and ratings of pain , anxiety and fatigue . <h> 4 . Improves Creativity <p> In an experiment at the Chelsea Flower show which compared people 's outputs across different office spaces , when included , the humble houseplant was shown to boost creativity by as much as 45% ! <p> Creativity can breed a deep sense of happiness and satisfaction . Is it any coincidence that the creatively brilliant Beatles came around in the decade of ' flower power ' ? <h> 5 . Improve Your Memory and Attention Span <p> The stressful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that demand our attention - cars horns tooting or TV ads blaring - this does n't give our brains any relief .

Make You More Likely to Get a Date <p> Psychologists suspect we can not help our brains from making certain connections in many people mind flowers = romance . <p> In an experiment on dating a man stood outside various types of shops to ask people for a date , guess what , the most success he had was when asking outside of a florist ; flowers really could make you more attractive ! <h> 7 .

If you want to be more productive , get a plant - just make sure it is n't the kind that can help you sleep ! ( See point 3 ) . <h> 9 . Enhance Your Social Skills <p> Loneliness has been link to the development of a number of serious health conditions including depression and high blood pressure . Flower giving is a very social activity but I bet you did n't know that simply receiving a bunch of blooms makes you more sociable ? When given a flower or similar non-floral gift in an elevator , both men and women responded more sociably to receiving the flower " they were more likely to stand at a friendly distance and initiate conversation than had they not received the flowers . <h> 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain of childbirth or the familiar throb of a headache , we will all struggle with some sort of pain in our lives . How most people deal with it is to pop a few pills and get an early night ( the headache that is , we would recommend seeking medical help if your water just broke ! ) . You probably would n't have considering sitting next to a bunch of blooms might help " but this is exactly what scientists have proven . It was n't just a decorative effect as pain tolerance did not increase to the same extent when other colourful distractions were provided . <h> 11 . Works for Everyone <p> Not satisfied with pleasing both men , women and the elderly , flowers are great for kids too ! In a substantial survey where some 100,000 children were surveyed , parents reported maintaining a houseplant will improve children 's self-esteem and lower their stress levels . <p> Your typical bloke may ridicule the idea of receiving a bouquet " but in a number of studies men 's job satisfaction and productivity saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female counterparts . It does n't stop there , in a study on the elderly in nursing homes , it was discovered that basic horticultural activities , such as something as simple as learning how to maintain a houseplant has a positive impact on the quality of life . 184144 @qwx384144 184154 @qwx384154

@@36713265 @5713265/ <h> Summer Traditions <p> 29 June 2016 <p> By Sarah <p> Nothing heralds the British summer more than devouring a bowl of strawberries and cream while watching Wimbledon . This delicious culinary treat has been associated with the tennis event since 1877 . Apparently some 23 tonnes of strawbs and 7,000 litres of cream are enjoyed during the fortnight , but no-one really knows why . <p> The link may be that English statesman Thomas Wolsey used to serve the treat and had a real tennis court at Hampton Court . No doubt , many of us we 'll be hoping for a Brit win this year so we can wash down our strawberries with some bubbles ! If Andy Murray does n't hit the spot , we can always hope for medals at the Rio Olympics . Why not celebrate our sports ' finest with a stunning Strawberry Sorbet or Champagne Sorbet bouquet . <p> " Who does n't enjoy a Pimm 's on a balmy summer 's day ? " <p> " Who does n't enjoy a Pimm 's on a balmy summer 's day ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regatta . I must confess going to the regatta in Henley-on-Thames several years ago but only seeing a handful of races as the Pimm 's tent beckoned . But who does n't enjoy a Pimm 's on a balmy summer 's day ? Interestingly , it was first produced in 1823 by James Pimm after he realised customers stayed longer when they sipped ( rather than slugged ) their gin . Ice , mint and orange slices please ! For a vibrant orange , yellow and white bouquet drink in a 50 Lily Blooms bouquet . <p> Yesteryear summer traditions of holiday camps , donkey rides on the beach and a strawberry Mivvi have been superseded by barbequing at the first hint of sunshine , glamping and obsessing about the weather , pollen , and the traffic . <p> Also , you ca n't have failed to have noticed we 've gone music-festival crazy in recent years , with a long list of them throughout the summer from Glastonbury to T in the Park . Part of this tradition is to pay an arm and a leg for your ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the torrential downpours ! Food festivals are fast becoming as popular as music festivals with chilli , beer , garlic , apple and even sausage festivals to choose from . <p> I love that the British eccentricity lives on in wackier summer traditions including cheese rolling , ferret racing , tombola , growing the biggest turnip at village fetes , gurning competitions , bog snorkelling , worm charming and Morris Dancing . 184144 @qwx384144 184154 @qwx384154

I 'll be bringing out the bunting , cutting the crusts off the cucumber sandwiches and helping host a right royal knees-up street party . Her Majesty 's official birthday weekend is in June with the traditional Trooping the Colour ceremony , a mass street party in The Mall and festivities at Windsor Castle . But like the Queen , I 'm happy to blow out the candles - twice ! <p> Queen Elizabeth has n't just reached an incredible age , she 's also our longest-reigning monarch clocking up over 63 years on the throne ( pipping Queen Victoria ) , 97 state visits , 56 Christmas messages , 12 Prime Ministers , 8 grandchildren , 5 great-grandchildren , 67 years of marriage to her beloved Philip - and not forgetting owning over 30 Corgis . Not bad for a princess who was n't destined for the throne . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's favourite flowers , said to be carnations " <p> I can imagine Buckingham Palace will be filled with the Queen 's favourite flowers , said to be carnations . Her fondness for flowers is also recognised with roses adorning The Royal Mint 's commemorative 90th birthday -5 coin . <p> If you want to fill your home with regal blooms to mark this special occasion , you wo n't go far wrong with purple flowers . Rumour has it purple is linked with royalty because the dye originally used to create purple had to be sourced from a snail found only in the Tyre region of the Mediterranean Sea , so it was exclusive and expensive .
