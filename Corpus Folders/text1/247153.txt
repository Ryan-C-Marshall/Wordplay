The next arc wont start for quite a while , so I 'll be clearing on my stuff . <p> Its kind of done and not finished at the same time . Technically its supposed to be more of a horizontal splash title screen for TAS , so when I crop it later on , its just slightly above the neck and title . That kind of saves me from drawing the ring and background . I think its kind of interesting to think about placing the light directions for this illustration though . <p> At some point I was thinking , well the shirts design is n't that great , and the posture is n't that interesting . Technically I did plan to add some form of emblem on the side of the shirt , but I still think its still going to be somewhat boring because Brendel is n't doing anything in particular . <p> Things that he could be doing are holding a sword or a card etc . Hmm . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future so that I can save time on doing a splash screen and a proper illustration . <p> Ill be practicing some anatomy stuff in the next few days and then draw some fanart for Nier:Automata or Persona 5 . <p> During this month , I 'll also look into getting a website and check out some plugins so that the readers can have more features . You guys will finally get the features you want to see ( well , at least the previous/next button and standard linkage , no promises on reading mode though ) . <p> Chapter 131 Thou Art my Friend ( 2 ) <p> The ones who really participated in the negotiations were Count Barre , Fleetwood and the newly arrived Elven commander of the Unicorn Knights . <p> Buga and Makarov went over to the bushes with Brendels directions , brought out a bloody Eke out from there with reluctant thanks , and lowered their glowering attitudes against him . The Silver Elves had clearly displayed their intentions to protect Brendel because he protected the graves of their old kings . <p> Brendel sat beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he did not participate in the negotiation , he knew that Count Barres core topic would now be about the Silver Elves instead of him . The Silver Elves had disappeared and gave up on this particular forest a long time ago . This land was now regarded to be part of the kingdom , and even the closest allies of the past may not easily enter this land anymore . <p> Aouine had the upper hand on the territory . <p> Brendel could see the Silver Elf commander was adamant in his attitude , almost refusing Count Barre and Fleetwoods every suggestion . He wondered what sort of agreement would the two increasingly annoyed men enter into . <p> " Are you able to guess why the Silver Elves have returned ? " He suddenly asked . <p> " How should I know what these strange Elves are thinking about . They do n't  socialize with others . " Rauzes voice was nonchalant at the start , before she suddenly grumbled . " And stop disturbing from doing my important stuff ! " <p> " What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knight Ser Brendel . Its really hard for me to get good inspirations . Oh , I forgot to mention , I 'm a bard " Rauzes voice turned to one of pride . <p> A bard <p> Brendel frowned from that revelation . It seemed like many of the dragons professions were bards . He recalled a famous quest in the game : A dragon made a huge underground dungeon and captured a few strong monsters and put them inside , becoming the BOSS with his monster underlings . When the unsuspecting adventurers or gamers challenged him , he would record the results and turned them into stories . If they won , then the dragon awarded them part of his treasures . Some gamers investigated the whole affair and proved that the dragon actually made ten times more money than what the given treasure was worth . <p> The quest was meant for level 45 players and was disguised as a normal chain event , but gained notoriety when this secret was revealed . Many players were quite impressed with it and was a hot topic for quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dragons had bad hobbies , they were still much better than the ones who actually just directly robbed others . <p> Tsk . He clicked his tongue sarcastically when he heard nothing more from her . <p> He suddenly heard a cracking sound behind him , and whipped his head around , thinking that it was Rauze but it was Nalaethar instead . The latter had taken off his helmet and looked solemnly at Brendel , then at the creature beside him ; his eyes had a puzzled streak in them . <p> Brendel looked blankly at him , then gave a smile and said : " Hey , Nalaethar " <p> The handsome Elf looked back at him , slightly startled at Brendels strange tone . <p> " Could you wear your helmet ? " <p> " Why ? " His monotone reply came . <p> " You 're so good looking that I feel great pressure looking at you . " The youth sighed . <p> Nalaethar smiled for the first time . He thought about the request seriously before wearing back the helmet , leaving only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paused for a while before he spoke again . <p> " I 'm leaving , Brendel . " <p> Brendel looked back with puzzled eyes . It was obvious that the Elf was going to leave when the mission was over . He wanted to say thankful words but suddenly realized that there was an empty feeling in his heart . Even though they did not exchange any wasted words along the way , he had trusted in this ally completely and he was now leaving . <p> He wondered where Nalaethar was going to go after this . <p> Is he going back to the altar or take his final slumber ? The Altars magic is growing weaker by the day and although I said I 'll bring back information of the outside world , is it really possible to do so ? Maybe this is really like a quest , Nalaethar and I will only meet this one time and once I leave , the Altar will be nothing more than an abandoned building . <p> The more he thought about it , the more he felt that possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fact . After a long time , he could only find the greedy words inside of him . <p> " Breaking promises . That 's something you humans are fond of . Of course I will fulfill it . " He took out a scroll and handed it to Brendel as he spoke . " I have written the usage of the skill on it , my friend . " <p> That two words struck Brendel like a bolt of lightning and he looked stupidly back at him . Nalaethar squeezed the scroll into his hand and hugged him once , before releasing him with a smile : " I thank you for bringing us a battle . We had hoped to have one for a long time . The blood in me has once again been set aflame . You are exceptional . Your skills in battle impressed me and the others , but there comes a time where we have to go our separate ways . Now , you owe me a promise " <p> Nalaethar closed his eyes : <p> " Remember to tell me the events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred years from now . I will wait for you to fulfill it , my friend . " <p> " I will . Yes . " Brendel wiped his eyes with his hand . " The wind is a little big . " <p> Nalaethar nodded with understanding . <p> " There is one other thing . We rushed over to your side because of the Acolyte of Earth . We do not know what has become of your mercenaries , you should ask the Nightsong Tiger for more details . " <p> His body was gradually disappearing , his helmet dissolving away to show his smile one last time . All the heroic Elven spirits then turned into white light and shot out into the sky , disappearing into a certain direction in the southern forest . <p> The other humans looked puzzledly at that display , while Brendel caught the Elven commander of the Eversong army nodding to him with respect from afar . <p> The youth felt slightly better at Nalaethars parting words , before he set off to the Nightsong Tigers location . <p> Count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could not allow his forces to fight against the Silver Elves : the Eversong army was renowned in the continent for their skill , and persisted in the lore for more than seven centuries . The only wise decision he could make was to retreat . <p> In the end , they negotiated a neutral standpoint , they each retreated three hundred meters away and set up camp , and the atmosphere in the forest finally lost some of its bloodlust . <p> The Elven knights nodded at Brendel with respect , and their commander walked over and gave him a silver fern leaf . It looked something like a bookmark , but Brendel knew that it was a sign of the Silver Elves greatest gratitude . <p> Nice . If there 's some political bullshit in Aouine , I can apply for political asylum . He joked to himself . <p> The silver leaf allowed him to redeem a boon from the Silver Elves , and anyone who brought it before them could seek help no matter how much time had passed- He did knew that someone in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infantry from the Silver Elves and the loan period was a hundred years , although he did not know what favors could be sought exactly , <p> The Silver Elves heavy infantry was just one or two ranks below the Eversong army , but they were definitely regarded as the top tier army to have . Brendel wanted to try and ask for that favor right away , but stopped after a moment of deliberation . This was an alternate parallel world which was different from a game . It would be much better to establish a proper relationship with the Silver Elves so that he could gain more in the future . <p> If he acted greedy , these prideful and distant race might look down on him and affect things in many subtle ways . It would be a loss . <p> So the arc has ended he has a potential favor from elves and is basically enemy number one for the royals fuunnn Well I guess it is possible to mediate that relationship but who knows .

@@37042133 @6042133/ <h> The Amber Sword Volume 2 Chapter 123 <p> Brendel thought he was an average human being in his past and present life . The difference between the two was that he knew the events that were to come in the future . With that basis , he had a larger ambition and desire to change Aouines fate , and change that ending that he bitterly regretted . <p> That thought did not really have anything to do with the word selfless . His wish was born out of his desires and feelings , and did not think he had become a noble person even if he saved many people in that path . <p> He would mete punishment equivalent to the evil deeds done , while answering with rewards to good deeds shown , and firmly believed in that principle . He had never bound himself with the responsibilities of a messiah or the likes , but at the same time he could not ignore Ekes situation . <p> Mother Marsha , did I offend you or something <p> He looked up to the sky with a helpless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stop running and come back to where you were ! " He shouted to Eke . <p> Eke stopped running after a short while , but the Acolyte of Earth was already in the middle of the two . It first stared at Eke , before looking back at Brendel , and recognized him as the one he had been chasing all along . <p> " Is it really a gentlemans behavior to steal the monster Im hunting ? " Brendel said as he looked at the monsters many eyes , feeling like his emotions were being tied into complicated knots . He really wanted to smack the youth on the head a few times , but the latters actions invoked a sense of favorable impression towards him . <p> In the end he made a sarcastic remark . <p> " Thanks . " Eke looked back at him with a grateful smile and shouted . He knew if Brendel did not help in confronting the enemy , he would only last for a few seconds before getting shredded into pieces . The monster seemed to exceed the strength of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible task . <p> It was clear that this was his fault . When he saw Brendel removing a spell , he immediately knew that it was a Silence spell ; a spell frequently used by mercenaries to either ambush or infiltrate , and he was familiar with it . This was the equivalent of pulling Brendel right into danger , especially when he was clearly hurt all over from the start . <p> He sighed lightly and became convinced that the man on the tree was a righteous knight . Ever since he was young , he was engrossed in reading novels about knights and even dreamed of becoming one . Becoming a mercenary meant that his dream was still a little far away , but his conviction had never changed . It was also the reason why the Grey Wolves Mercenaries liked him so much . <p> " Ser Knight , let us work together to defeat this monster ! " <p> Eke shouted somewhat excitedly . He knew that even if the both of them fought together they were not be able to defeat it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least have heroic deaths . He even thought it was Mother Marsha granting him a chance to fight a monster together with a real knight in his last moments , instead of seeing viewing this encounter as bad luck . ( TL : This dude is absolutely bananas . ) <p> " Huh ? " Brendel obviously did not understand what he was talking about . <p> There was a flash of red that appeared in the monsters eyes , and Brendel tensed up . It was a sign that it was about to attack , and he was on the verge of activating his Charge ability when he realized the monster did not move to attack him . He soon found out that it was- because Eke had gone up and tried to attack it . <p> " Holy shit ! Are you crazy ? " <p> Brendel really wanted to cover his eyes at that moment . A level 30 idiot trying to hit a level 65 ( +15 ) boss in a Berserk state . Indeed , the Boss had an increase in levels ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it even had the abilities of its added levels . Layers and layers of rock walls sprouted from the ground to form elaborate patterns that prevented him from advancing . <p> Passive ability Rock Bulwark activated . <p> Green words appeared in Brendels eyes . Each layer of rock was six centimeters long and was formed with quartz , capable of resisting hardened steel swords . If anyone got close to it , the shield would automatically activate to defend it from harm . A normal physical attack was useless against it . <p> Eke did not know that and he struck at the walls , and the sword only penetrated a few centimeters before it was stopped . He immediately realized that it was a bad move but it was too late to retreat . <p> The monster swung its arm backwards , its hardened forelimb bringing about a sharp blade made of wind , cutting and breaking its own layers of rocks to reach Eke . At that moment , he thought he had taken his last breath , but someone knocked deeply unto him with a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to roll on the ground uncontrollably . When he finally managed to open his eyes from the pain , he realized that the monsters attack had missed him . <p> When he turned his head to the side , he saw Brendel groaning as he got up and immediately understood what happened . After having a moment to allow his mind to function properly , he hurriedly spoke with gratitude : " Thanks ag " <p> " Fuck ! " Brendel punched the ground . The idiot had wasted his ability again . Even though Eke was better with his personality compared to the bastards Makarov and Buga , this was truly an idiot who did not think about consequences . No matter how he looked at Eke , it was clear that Makarov failed to teach him how to think ahead . <p> The so-called idiot youth jumped a little when he saw Brendel looking angry , but the latter did not say anything else and the monster was not going to wait for them , so he put his worries aside and bravely said : " Ser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him " <p> " Shut your god damned mouth ! Stop your bullshit ! " Brendel cut him off again with a roar . <p> " I 'm sorry " <p> " Forget it . Just stop your nonsense . " Brendels patience had ran out and his replies were curt . The monster began to charge towards them like a heavy tank and he immediately stood up . There was no time to waste when he had to face a boss with limited options . Since the monster had trouble turning around easily , he kicked himself off the trees and launched himself to the sides and ran towards the monsters rear . <p> Ill test out Frontal Assault first <p> What surprised him was how easy he managed to get behind him . Even if the monster turned slowly , it would not give up on defending itself . He was even prepared to suffer an attack if things went awry . But he suddenly thought of another possibility and stiffly turned his head to Eke , then broke out into a cold sweat . <p> Eke had placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Earth directly where he was . <p> " What the fucking hell- ! " <p> Brendel stopped his motion to use Frontal assault and instead raised his hand to use the Flame Ring . The explosive fireball struck the monsters shoulder , disrupting its aim slightly . Instead of hitting Ekes chest the attack landed on his left shoulder instead . The latter cried out loudly and was knocked straight into the bushes . There was a loud crash as he slammed into a tree and there was no further sound . <p> Brendel quickly retreated , but when he looked at the monster that was turning towards him , he could only scream repeatedly by cursing Eke in his mind . <p> He was completely out of options now . He could only hope for Nalaethar to reach here as soon as possible , but it seemed like the wish was truly unlikely . Was Mother Marsha listening to his prayers ? <p> Suddenly , he heard a light giggle that sounded like it came from a child . It sounded truly out of place in this forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle the situation was quickly reversed . She did not want to tell her how many Exploding Crystals she had , and simply handed two over to the mercenaries who quickly used them against the Lizardmen , forcing them back from the roof . However , their commander ordered them to attack in a loose formation and once again pushed towards the roof . <p> Romaine took out another two Exploding crystals and indicated that she did not have anymore left , but no one believed her . The horn from the battlefield suddenly sounded out for a long time . This was a signal to indicate the battle at the frontlines was over , and they were free to pull out of battle . <p> However , Amandina did not want this to end and she quickly issued an order . <p> " Deyna , get me Romaines bag " <p> The Elven girl obeyed the order and resulted in Romaine staring at Amandina with teary eyes . The latter took her bag and poured it out onto the ground . She discovered there was another two Exploding Crystals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you these things are dangerous ! How could you hide six Exploding Crystals from me ! <p> " I did make sure that I kept them carefully . " Romaine said in a pitiful voice . <p> Its almost a shame that they were so thorough , a little longer with their gradual instability and the problem wouldve taken care of itself . But I guess Brendel wouldve been sad or close enough to get hurt so its for the best . <p> So .. Because of Romaine intruding on a perfect plan and " saving " 6 exploding crystals , the first ambush totally failed , and all of these are unnecessary fights that only happened because of the first failed ambush ? Good job Romaine , giving us more chapter to read and wolfie to translate .

" The twin Elementalists spoke at the same time . They were the ones who made the Magic Bolts and clearly the best people to recognize what the bolts were . The Bolts of Accuracy were uniquely imbued with Light Magic , and even the other mercenaries could make a guess . <p> But they did not understand what their lord was attempting to do with the magic bolts . There was no difference in damage even if a normal bolt was used . What was different was the accuracy . <p> Is there some weakness somewhere on the monster ?

" <p> " No , it looks like a rope . " <p> They finally saw that there was a rope connected to the bolts at a persons chest height . <p> Anti cavalry rope trap ! <p> They were quickly surprised by Brendels ingenuity , but some of the magic savvy men pointed out that the Spectral Knight was a spirit creature , which was resistant against physical objects and hardly effective . <p> The Spectral Knight noticed the bolts and charged towards Brendels direction without considering it as a trap .

Red light poured forth like a laser from the ruby ring after a short delay and struck the Spectral Knights chest . <p> It was as if any other light sources dimmed and the surroundings turned darked . Flames with the intensity of the suns brightness flared from the center of the Spectral Knight . An explosive blast resounded throughout the whole forest that even Brendel had to cover his ears .

" <p> Her voice did not disguise the surprise she had . They had won the battle without anyone dying and got away with mild injuries . <p> Brendel confirmed it with the Stats Window . He had successfully risen by two levels . <p> Two more levels before I can select the next talent . The first talent decides the different physical attributes , while the second talents dictates that path of what a character can take on in the future . Its the most important talent amongst the others . <p> " Its a pity that the fireball magic takes time to activate . If its an instant spell I would n't have to pull off all these stunts . " Brendel sighed as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down as they were made from magical properties . <p> He made a long sigh and drank thirstily from his waterskin . This battle was not as exhausting as the ones he had earlier , where he found it hard to even lift a finger . However this was highly dependent on being flawless in executing the strategy , and every mistake caused him to shake in fright . <p> His reflection on the battle quickly turned into shock as he found that the Spectral Knight did not turn into dust . It was lying quietly on the ground as the mount stopped beside , nuzzling against its hand . <p> The Soul Fire slowly disappeared on both the Spectral Knight and the mount at different speeds . The glowing armors on them started to crack , before vanishing into the air like tufts of smoke , revealing the body under the heavy armor . <p> " A unicorn ? ! " Brendel first identified the mount . <p> He gaped at the transformation of the supposedly evil beast , revealing a body with bristling muscles that could only belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its forehead which easily disclosed its identity . <p> Wait , but does n't  the legends in Vaunte state that only the purest of maidens can ride a unicorn ? <p> He turned his head to look down , and spat out the water in his mouth . Some of it even went into his nose and made him cough uncontrollably . The armor that covered the Spectral Knight had completely disappeared , and a young Elven girl was lying there like a sleeping princess dressed with an finely tailored dress , or perhaps to be more accurate it was the spirit of the Elven girl that was there . <p> A silver seal was still present on her forehead , which signified that she had not became an adult as according to the Elven customs , perhaps one who was unfortunate enough to die early . Brendels pupils narrowed in utter dismay as he realized what he had been fighting against . <p> A young girl ? ! That was what we were fighting against ? <p> Brendel was seized with mental anguish as memories of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distressing screams as the slave merchants slaughtered the gamers and NPCs one by one , till they were finally routed . Did it not resemble the same actions they took when Brendel led his men to slay this undead monster ? <p> Everyone else had came up with the intention to congratulate Brendel as they approached him , but once they saw the real figure of the enemy they had fought , they were taken by surprise . <p> " This " The Nightsong Tiger looked at the translucent sprit and did not know what words to utter . <p> Amandina was also startled , and she breathlessly asked : " That thing from before Is her ? " <p> Brendel gritted her teeth as he nodded . <p> It might have been quite inconceivable that a young girl was capable of the feats that she did earlier , but that was the truth . In the back of his mind , he had faintly thought of the possibility of the idea that it was some corruption of a former Elven king that made it turn into a Spectral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him made him shudder . <p> Amandina frowned but accepted the explanation . <p> " Do we kill her ? " A small voice asked . <p> Brendel turned to the voice and found that it was the younger Elementalist . The older sister only furrowed her brows , but it was clear that both of them were conflicted over the decision to kill a fellow Elf . <p> The Silver Elves and Wild Elves were quite different . The Wild Elves had sunny dispositions , were kind and agreeable . They got along with humans more so than many other races , and even stayed in the human cities , as well as marrying them . <p> But the Silver Elves were aloof and the true lineage of the noble Elves , stayed faithfully to the prophecies and avoid the material world , giving the world a mysterious and venerated image . They were usually taller than the humans , having lithe figures and graceful actions . They were the earliest descriptions of nobles and seemed unreachable like the moon . <p> Such was the difference between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silver Elf lying before them . <p> Brendel felt a pair of eyes on him , and he turned towards Romaine . She seemed to ask the same question , but she yearned to hear the answer she expected the most . <p> Brendel licked his lips nervously and shook his head . He turned his gaze back at the spirit . The Soul Energy was breaking down as the spirit became more transparent . Even though she had not disappeared yet , she would not be able to hold on much longer . <p> " She is already dead . What you see now is the soul disappearing . " <p> Romaine uttered a disappointed sound . <p> Brendel was also feeling puzzled . The damage that she received was far beyond a Spectral Knight could handle . Even if she was ten levels higher , she should had been turned into dust and not appear like a sleeping beauty .

Even though he had ordered the men to clean the battlefield , there was still the remnants of a skirmish between his men and the Lizardmen . <p> When he was pondering on his next step , he suddenly heard a shuffling noise behind him . When he turned around , he saw the Elven princess tying her silver hair that reached her shoulders . She rode on her unicorn , wearing an ornate full plate armor that was painted in a saintly white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her legs as the layers of interlocking armor plates moved ever so slightly , and Sanford mistook it for a silver dress for a moment . Her eyes were so clear that they looked like crystals . She was so beautiful that he lost his breath when his eyes went up to her face . <p> Medissas unicorn trotted over and she looked at Brendel with a smile . <p> Thank you , my lord- She spoke in Brendels mind . <p> " It is my promise to help you . " Brendel tore his eyes away from her with much difficulty and replied as he looked at the valley again . <p> Medissas face turned a little red . His words made her recall what happened on that day . She was so afraid of disappearing that she cried in front of everyone and forgot about the Silver Elves royal etiquette . <p> She turned her head a little out of embarrassment and suddenly saw Scarlett who was standing further away from the others . <p> Her eyes in the shade seemed like two burning embers , while she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little to the sides to look at the scenery . <p> Brendel told her about the things that happened so far . The Blood of Gods , the disbandment of the Grey Wolves Mercenaries , as well as the events that happened after that . After she finished listening to him , she had been quiet ever since and kept her distance away . <p> She did not show sadness or anger . <p> " What will happen to that lady ? " Medissa asked in a soft voice . <p> " The Blood of Gods has been planted in her body . The corruption can not be removed by any means that I know , and it is currently suppressed by her own will . If she fails to control it , she will turn into an Acolyte . That word might sound nice , but you might as well call an Acolyte a monster instead . " <p> The rules have been established with Medissa as the first Eversong card , and if Scarlett agrees I can seal her as a card . But that will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that it will work every time without any side effects ? <p> Brendel had reservations towards the Planeswalkers system . Sealing was a foreign concept to him and could have unknown results and problems , especially with the powerful influence of the Blood of Gods . What would happen if she was not under his control ? <p> Medissas brows frowned slightly upon hearing his words , but the quiet personality of her race made her say nothing at all . <p> Brendel did not continue speaking and checked the mercenaries at the opposite end . They had split up and hid themselves in the abandoned buildings that once stood tall , crafted by the Silver Elves grandmaster artisans . Their crossbows were currently trained on the Lizardmen in front of them in order to make sure they did not regroup with the leaders . <p> These Lizardmen which guarded the entrance were left alone in order to make Conrad and Hewjil believe that everything was still fine in the ruins . <p> " Brendel . " Another set of familiar footsteps , along with a voice filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to turn his head back to know who was calling him . He was even lazy enough not to turn around , and extended his palm behind his shoulders : " Youre already done ? " <p> " Of course . The Great Merchant Romaines efficiency is very high . Here are the crystals . I already distributed a batch to everyone , everything has been prepared and were just waiting for your orders to attack . " <p> " Its a shame that all my materials have been used up , " Amandina barely managed to make a smile in spite of her exhaustion : " But I can make more of them in the future . The rest of the materials that I have now , including the Magicite , has been dismantled to make them . " <p> Brendel nodded and carefully placed each Exploding Crystal into his pouch on his belt . He then signaled to the Nightsong Tiger and received a longsword from him . He pointed the blade to the outside : " The enemies are very cautious and we cant deceive them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll go out to distract them . Medissa and Scarlett , both of you follow me . Our goal is to distract Conrad and Hewjil . As for their subordinates , Nalaethar and the rest of the men should be enough to handle them . " <p> The Elven Commander looked over to Brendel and nodded . <p> " Do n't  just nod , commander . " Brendel did not forget to remind him : " Do n't  forget about your promise to me . " ( TL : In case anyone forgot , that promise is a taught skill if Brendel wins . ) <p> Also make sure to care of the Grey Wolves Mercenaries , they cant revive like you do . He added in his mind . <p> He turned to Sanford after seeing the Nightsong Tiger nod . " Make sure to protect yourselves , you can enjoy a victory only if you 're alive . " <p> " Understood , my lord . " Sanford nodded respectfully . <p> Brendel questioned them carefully to make sure they understood the orders . Other than Nalaethar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces . Perhaps Leto could be counted as his men , but they were different because their reputation and status were actually higher than him . <p> The forces that he had here now were truly loyal to his cause , or at least Amandina and the Grey Wolves Mercenaries relied deeply on him because they had no one else to turn to . <p> It was not that he did not trust Leto , but it was good to have distance and time to be placed between them . He had seen enough betrayals from NPCs and gamers who swore fealty to each other to be cautious . <p> Hewjil and Conrad did not seem to notice anything out of place yet . For some reason , the dragoons were not at the front of the Lizardmen and Brendel was tremendously pleased at that sight . The impact would be greater with the first strike . <p> Seven hundred meters . Brendel read the data . <p> The gradual noise from the Lizardmen became louder as they passed through the forest . It was as if a current of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that scurried through were becoming bigger . The mercenaries that were at the very forefront placed their hands on their pouch . The Exploding Crystals were 15 OZ worth , with the force of Iron-ranked magicians Mana Arrow . <p> Five hundred meters . <p> At this range , people with high perception like Nalaethar , Brendel , Medissa and Brendel were able to almost see the Lizardmens expressions . They appeared to be extremely tired from the overnight march , to the point that they did not realize they were going to be ambushed . <p> Scarlett bent to her knees as she seeked for Conrads familiar figure , gripping her Spear of Lightning so hard that it was making noises . <p> The Lizardmen continued to march closer and closer , and at this point they suddenly felt something was wrong with the area they were in . They sniffed the air and chattered , continuing to march forward , but Brendel saw ten odd dragoons stopping in the west direction . <p> Shit , we have been discovered ! Damn it , the leaders Hewjil and Conrad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further . <p> - <p> Brendel raised his hand and directed his ring into the forest . A dazzling red flash emitted from the ring and even seemed to dim the suns rays for a moment . A huge fireball hurled itself through the forest and dragged countless burning leaves in its path , before a loud explosion struck the enemies , and a blast of hot wind came back to him and swept his hair upwards . <p> The impact from the fireball killed a total of twenty Lizardmen dragoons and Lizardmen Warriors . It was certainly a surprising harvest and proof of their tight positions . This was the signal for his men to attack . <p> The mercenaries opposite from Brendel fired their crossbows immediately and killed the remaining guards at the Elven ruins entrance , then reached for the Exploding Crystals and took it out . <p> They were approximately three hundred meters away , but they possessed enough strength as Iron-ranked fighters to toss them far enough into the enemies midst . The crystals caught the sun rays and glittered as they flew in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a moment of silence as the Lizardmen peered at the crystals . <p> It was the calm before the storm , as bright light poured through the crystals as they bounced on the ground and lit the forest . The bursts of light kept forming in succession before explosions rang out one after another ; the exploding crystals impact ruptured the ground and the shockwave sent debris everywhere . <p> When the mercenaries finally recovered from the scene , they discovered the landscape of the forest had changed permanently . <p> There were numerous craters that formed into a deep cavity in the ground . Giant trees were uprooted and splintered into large fragments , while hundreds of Lizardmen were turned into corpses with missing body parts . Blood and soil were caked together , along bloody innards and brain matter splattered on trees and bushes , dripping down freely onto the ground . <p> It was like living hell depicted in paintings . <p> Even Brendel dry-heaved once before he forced back the urge to puke , and concentrated on calculating the remaining enemies . <p> Hewjil brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least four hundred of them here right now. - I doubt he will want to distribute his forces to Conrad and the Dark Bishop if its not because of the search for us . Conrad has his own men My guess is a total of more than seven hundred men that we need to deal with . That really is n't something to laugh about . Even though we cleared more than 10% of the enemies from that attack , we cant deal with so many enemies . We need to do thin the numbers again . <p> Brendel knew that it was his time to strike at the enemys formation . He signaled to Scarlett and Medissa , and they prepared themselves to attack . <p> I did n't  mean it in that way . Its the paragraph structure . The paragraph is all about Brendel and then it switches to Sanfords POV briefly . Normally there should be a paragraph break before that sort of thing at least in English writing .

I simply chose Sanford for variety , because the male elf commander would n't fit in because he has the culture aspect down , while Brendel probably saw more than enough Elf armors in the game to not mistake things . <p> Admittedly I did n't  really pay enough attention in English classes to remember how to write better on such things , so if there are any areas that I should improve on or there 's a good writing book you want to recommend , please let me know and I 'll spend some time reading it . <p> I 'm going to have to separate some choice words , probably changing the Earth Bishop to Avatar of Earth . This is because the boss description is a monster-like creature and not a humanoid at his current level ( chapter 115 ) . <p> About that black bishop , I 'm assuming you mean the Dark Bishop who led a few hundred Lizardmen and got killed ? <p> Yes , I meant the dark bishop ; I confused dark with black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now that I re-read my comment I see that it was write in a very confused manner , was that the " dark bishop " mentioned at the end of the chapter was probably supposed to be the other bishop ( the earth avatar ) , since the former is dead .

This was something that he expected , as a person from the countryside would not have seen the machinations behind the nobles goals before . <p> But to summarize everything , its all about greed . <p> He decided to be as clear as possible : " I know that it might be difficult for all of you to accept . But the truth is were nothing but pawns on the chessboard , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Freya was shocked when she heard that , and she looked up at him . <p> But Marden frowned and sighed . What Brendel said was what he had seen for the past few days . The nobles had declared to him that the Bucces militia and his army would be rewarded for the defense . Everyones morale was raised when they heard the news , but if he was to look at things in another way , only one or two of them would be promoted , and a meager amount of money to be distributed amongst them as a reward . <p> And every time he mentioned about Bucces homeless refugees , the reply was always ambiguous . <p> " Freya , " Brendel looked deeply into Freyas light brown eyes . " If you hope to see something like everyone getting commended and rewarded for their efforts , then move back to the countryside and live a happy and safe life after the war , you 're going to get disappointed for having such a naive and unrealistic thought . " <p> " Brendel ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on someone else , you 're going to become a pawn that 's going to be discarded by the nobles sooner or later . " <p> Freya had seen and heard much in Fortress Riedon , and she could somehow understand his words , so she hesitated for a while before asking : " Then what should I do ? " <p> " Become stronger , until you can be a person who can protect others . " <p> " I-I know , but " Freya answered in a rush . <p> I 'm just the leader of a small militia group , how am I supposed to become as powerful as the nobles amongst the capital ? Its impossible ! <p> " Youre worried that you cant do it ? " He asked . <p> Freya nodded . <p> " Theres no need to be worried about it . An opportunity would present itself before you in the future . " He smiled and replied . <p> Freya was slightly confused and looked back in a daze . <p> Brendel had not told her what exactly he had planned for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cavalry academy that was built by the royal crown , so that she could receive the kingdoms formal education on commanding an army , as well as learning various combat knowledge . <p> He did not wish to change the Freyas future as a Goddess of War , but at the same time , he wanted her to enter the higher ranks within the kingdom . <p> Romaine is unable to go do something like this , and the only person with enough capabilities and my trust , is only Freya . In regards of safety , there 's really no need to worry about it . The school is in Verand , a land that is the private property of the Royal Crown . It is also a land that the princess would get hold of in December when the civil war starts . Everything seems to be good for Freya . <p> Brendel did not think the old military commanding style and the tactics of Aouine was inferior , but there was a certain quality required for the strategies to work , and the Aouine army was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ineffective . <p> With Freyas serious attitude , she will be absorbing the knowledge taught by the school like a sponge . When she gathers enough achievements under her belt , she will stand out from the crowd just like how it happened in history , and catch the eye of the princess . <p> Brendel recalled that it was the second year of the sixth month , that Freya met the princess during the Academys 64th jousting tournament . Since he was going to stay out of the capital , he felt that there would not be too much of a change in Freyas future . <p> Princess Grffyn Corvado Manoff . She is only sixteen this year , but soon she will be the acting regent . I definitely need to know her thoughts are . And I have to borrow Freyas help with this matter . <p> Brendel considered things for a second . He felt that there were no clashes with their goals . She wanted to revive the kingdom , while he wanted to turn Aouines ultimate fate around . However , he was worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , would not be able to put the nobles interest down . <p> His fist clenched tightly when the memories within the game appeared in his mind . It was a moment in history that he was unable to forget ; the final moment in the capital Monsteras , where the palace and city burned in a sea of flames , while the sky was dyed black by the smoke . <p> That day he and many players retreated to the north , and many of them cried while looking to the south . They were unable to change anything because there was just not enough time for them to be able to do anything . <p> How was he going to watch Freya fight to the death in the Crimon Valley Dalal again ? <p> That day everyone of us perished in that valley . I died seven times there and lost seven levels there , and many countless players also had the same fate that I had . But in the end , what was the result ? ( TL : Rhetorical question . ) <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sigils on it , with a flag in her hand with black pine leaves on it , the emblem of courage in Aouine . He and the thirty-six thousand players who swore to protect Aouine did not manage to protect that flag , and even until her death , she still stood tall in the battlefield . <p> Perhaps she fulfilled her own promise to she 'd every last drop of blood for this land . In the end Aouine was too weak and old . There were actually three different armies from Kirrlutz that stood there and did nothing . There was only Freyas army and players . And all of us players were no match for the opponents grand army . <p> The brightest jewel in the Corvado family , the princess fared no better . She married an Arreck duke that she did not like , and led a gloomy life , until she was murdered in a scheme conceived by The Unifying Guild . ( TL : Remember that fake noble that took Brendels sword ? He s from this guild . ) <p> Brendel thought back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They did not play the Amber Sword constantly and some of them stopped playing , but when they did gather together , they would talk about the past events that happened in the game . Everyone would still feel sorry when they remembered that day when Aouines spirit was gone forever . <p> Can I let this happen all over again ? <p> He looked at Freya , Romaine and Marden , then shook his head . If he was teleported somewhere else where he did not meet them , he might have considered to escape and develop slowly . With his knowledge , he would have become a legendary figure . <p> But experiencing the events and meeting everyone in Bucce made him realize that he was unable to do so , and he decided to take on a burden so that he could change Aouines fate . <p> Even now , I 'm still trying to figure out the possibilities in front of me . To change history , I definitely need to sweep everything off that 's blocking my path , and its possible that I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act like a despicable noble Not only that , I might have to fight against every single noble in Aouine , and even the princess had to choose carefully when dealing with that five infamous dukes . <p> Brendel rubbed his forehead when he thought about his specs . <p> My growth is n't that of a player and the enemies that I 'm going to face from Madara are pretty much a boss spec , not to mention they are considered uniquely talented , especially that boss amongst bosses , the emperor with the Mercury Staff . Even if I joined hands with the Goddess of War , is it really possible to change the future ? <p> Brendel thought about the future beyond Aouines demise . <p> If I go further in the timeline , Kirrlutz will take a passive and cold look at things . That Griffin Empire is not the cradle of ancient and kind human civilization . What replaced it is the pride of the highland natives , fueled by the revolution of steel and blood . The instruments of war will sound out loudly with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War will happen soon . When that happens , all the countries will become chess pieces on a gigantic chess board , including Madara . <p> Brendels mind shook a little when he thought of that . Doubt surfaced as he asked himself whether he was able to handle everything , because even if he averted the Madaras undead , what waited for him was something even bigger . He had thought about it slightly when he led the refugees from Fortress Riedon out . <p> Who am I kidding ? Maybe its the pride of a player from another world , but is n't this like a game that has the impossible rating on it ? <p> He thought that it was a little arrogant , but he felt that he needed to at least make an attempt in doing this , at least to make amends to that regretful event . <p> This was also why he felt that he had to acquire enough power and authority when the Civil War started . <p> When that event happens , all methods of leveling up might be affected because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best moment for me to have the opportunity to become a chess player and acquire both land and armies . <p> Brendel had already decided the location , a kingdom that was sealed once upon a time in the west . <p> I felt Emotional To think that Freya dies in such a brutal way .. I wish Brendel would just let it out already and tell Freya everything . That Freya is n't just an ordinary Girl . At least tell her how she dies . This Novel has taken it to a all new level . I cant help but wonder <p> I admire the fact that he refuses to be a pawn due to his pride as a Player but is willing to be the Chess Player instead <p> Wolfe you really left us hanging in cliff lol .

It had spotted a flag at the roof of the highest building . Even till now the mercenaries did not appear , but so did his men who were supposed to attack the backlines . The Lizardmen who fought against the Silver Elves in the frontlines were greatly demoralized , and the latter did not waste any time in launching another attack to take advantage of them . <p> This time , they managed to push the Lizardmen out and even took the control of the outer section .

Even though this old mans temper was incredibly bad and a stubborn person as well , he was exceedingly sharp . Anyone who tried lying to him would easily be exposed . <p> Another young man from the guards picked up the conversation after Bretton sat down to stop the awkward silence . He spoke about the battle in detail , with the occasional nods from the others or additional lines from them added to his description . Bretton and Marden were the only two people who kept their silence . <p> Brendel noted Mardens eyebrows trembling from time to time which showed off his anxiety in his heart . Bretton on the other hand , decided to simply watch everything in silence and ignore Brendel . <p> As Brendel continued to listen to them , and he soon figured who they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pursue them from Bucce should be the Corpse Wizard Rothko . He was a brilliant undead wizard in the game and given the nickname of Corpse Wizard by the players . His talent was to easily convert the undead spirits into necromancers , and thus his army was replenished very quickly . Even though he did not have a high offensive stat , he was cunning , patient and made use of his army as cannon fodder to exhaust the enemy and deal a blow to their morale . <p> Right now , he should only be at an apprentice level . Therefore , under Tarkuss tactics he would only be a leader of a middle sized army . Brendel wondered briefly if he encountered each other when he escaped from Bucce . <p> And he did not need to guess about the second armys identity . The one who razed the Green village to the ground was Kabias . The skeleton warrior was not famous in Madaras history , but was considered as a veteran and definitely one of Tarkuss generals in this battle . <p> A middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and at least twenty necromancers in them . Kabiass army , as one of the main forces sent as a vanguard , had at least one fifth of Tarkus left wings army . His large forces definitely had more than just skeleton soldiers and necromancers . It was highly likely that there were pale knights and dark warriors in the army too . <p> Brendel omitted many details to the Guards . He quoted legends and rumors to briefly describe their ranks , but stating their numbers was certainly out of the question . Even though he knew about the future , he had to tread carefully . <p> " I am not sure if you have heard of this location called Ansel . Its the main region where the undead wizards are living in . Madara is split into three factions . One faction is the vampires , one is the undead wizards . I 'm going to skip the description of these two factions , as you should have heard about them before . " <p> " The last faction is one that also holds considerable might . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knights that committed crimes , nobles that were exiled , pirates and undead wanderers . They worship the black bible , and are rulers that believe in the Madara traditional ways . " <p> " All these stories are very interesting , but they are just stories . " One of the guards retorted . <p> " No , just think if there is one person who could unify them , then Madara will return as the blight from the darkness . And right now , the current events match a certain prophecy . " <p> " You just said that this kingdom has never been unified before . " <p> " It has never been unified in the past , but their chance to do so is approaching before our very eyes . " <p> " What does this unification has to do with our situation ? " <p> " Of course there is , have you heard about the legend of the Mercury Staff ? " Brendel suddenly changed to another topic . <p> " Thats also described in the prophecy right ? Its said that when someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ? " Someone asked . <p> Brendel nodded . <p> " The full name is The Mercury Staff of Loptr . Loptr is an undead wizard genius and he nearly unified the Madara kingdom . Fortunately , he failed at the end and his staff went missing , and this legend was left behind . When someone possesses the staff , he would become the king of darkness . " <p> " And just this year of spring , someone had witnessed the appearance of the staff in Ansel . " <p> The old captain frowned : " Young man , even though I do n't  understand the fights between these powerful people , you mean to say there has been a great change in Madara ? This is certainly terrible news , and at the very least , it would mean that Madara is completely prepared for this invasion . Even though I do n't  know what their goals are , they would n't just invade us on a small scale right ? What you said sounds too ridiculous to be true , but that does not mean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of calluses was placed on his knee , and it was near enough to draw his sword anytime : " Bretton . Do you know this young man ? " <p> Bretton was startled . If he said that he was suspicious of Brendel , even though the captain would not immediately strike at him with the sword , he would at least tie him up and question him . <p> He looked at Brendel without hiding the ridicule in his eyes . But he thought for a while and did not choose to do something like that : " I know him and I think he s lying to us . But if I think about it rationally He has no reason to lie to us . " <p> " What if he has been bribed by Madara ? " Marden asked again . <p> " I have also thought about that , but that 's unlikely considering what he and the third militia squadron had been through . If this Madara commander had prepared things in advance , then I think our defeat was justifiable . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice-captain . <p> Eh ? <p> Not only Marden , even Brendel looked differently at the young vice captain . It seemed that this fellow had a pretty good head on him . He had the impression that he was too narrow minded and could not become a true leader . He started to mull over on his assessment on him again . <p> But even if Bretton had denied knowing him or accused him of something , Brendel had the confidence to persuade Marden due to his knowledge of the future . However , that might have led to a situation that he might expose himself as a different person . <p> " Alright , then were going back to the real topic , " Marden said . " Kid , then you believe that the Madaras goal is Fortress Riedon ? " <p> " In the Grinoires region , Aouines defensive line is Stronghold Vermiere . Fortress Riedon protects the flank of that defensive line , so Madaras goal can only be Fortress Riedon . " Brendel nodded . <p> Marden rubbed his nose and cursed : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are their bigwigs ? Fuck , why did we have to encounter this pile of pigshit trouble ! " <p> " I do n't  know the exact details , " Brendel said while obviously knowing that he knew everything : " But based on your description , there 's an undead wizard in the first army that pursued you , and one of the Dark lords army that came as reinforcements . " <p> " The undead wizards army formation is comprised of necromancers as a platoon leader . Its easy to recognize them . I believe the size is half a company of one hundred to two hundred undead . The Dark Lords army formation is more chaotic , but there should be at least the size of two companies , based on the size that invaded the Green village . " <p> " It sounds about right . " Marden nodded . <p> What he did not know was Brendel actually reduced the number by half . Even so , that number made everyone worried . The size of the undead army vastly outnumbered their thirty guard members who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How were they supposed to break the siege ? <p> The old captain also sighed . <p> " Alright , Brendel . Since you came to tell us all these things , would it be right for me to think that you have your own solution ? I can tell you right now , if the situation is as you have reported , then I have no confidence to bring these men out of this siege . " <p> Freya bleated with surprise . <p> But Brendel nodded : " I do . " <p> Everyones gaze suddenly focused on him , and even Bretton looked at him with shock and disbelief . <p> Brendel wiped his sweaty palms on his shirt and took a breath . He was a little tense . Even though he had a plan , he only had a little confidence in it , and to receive the attention of everyone made him feel pressured . The next few sentences he was going to say concerned many lives . He wondered if he needed to be more careful in his choice of words to convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not leave out something behind . <p> " Everyone can travel to the north and cross the River of Daggers . " He said . <p> " The River of Daggers ? " <p> " Where is that place ? Why do we need to go there ? " <p> Brendel hesitated for a while . How was he going to explain that the White Knight Ebdon and the Undead Ghost Vlad will be late for nearly two days before surrouding that area ? <p> ( TL : There are three grades of army here . The highest grade currently is the Kingdoms army , then the Guards , then the militia . Its kind of hard to spot the differences , so there might be some mistakes here and there from me . Just know that the people Brendel is about to meet are the Guards which is considered as a formal army compared to the militia . And if you are able to think of better middle-ages terms to replace Guards , feel free to comment. )

The tips that my teachers gave were kind of there but not quite enough or too hard to understand . The theory is there , using XYZ as coordinates in space to kind of plot where the fundamental shape should be , but I could never really grasp it properly because its too complicated for me . <p> Cusharts video goes into details about how he plots and constructs using , well , easy maths ( sort of ) . I 'm not sure how far I can go with his method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamentals in spatial XYZ coordinates . I 'm pretty much spending the entire day just to kind of practice in that area , and I 'll probably just keep going at it for the next 10 days . <p> I keep wanting to edit my old chapters and write some codes for the website , but the issue of needing to settle important fundamentals about anatomy keep coming up , and I really want to get my weakest area to a manageable state by the end of this month . <p> Anyways , here 's the donated chapter , and thank you very much for your continued support on TAS and putting up with my ramblings . <p> Also , to make up for the late chapter , I decided to TL one more chapter ( which took another few more hours , lol . ) <p> Chapter 106 Lure ( 6 ) <p> " You do n't  wish to learn ? " Nalaethar looked at Brendel with complete ridicule in his eyes . <p> " I want to , of course I want to . " Brendel rushed his answer out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiot would refuse a Silver Elfs technique ? <p> " The Elven techniques ca n't be taught to you , so there 's no need to think about it . " Nalaethars eyes changed back to its usual taciturn look . " Do n't  be so hasty , I already told you our techniques are specifically designed for my race . " <p> Brendel nodded , but his mind said otherwise : " Then ? " <p> " I can teach you something else that we learned , " Nalaethar paused for a moment : " Do you know how important it is to determine how strong your enemies " <p> " Hold on ! " Brendel drew in a breath rapidly and interrupted : " Are you talking about the ability Probe ? " <p> Brendel was trying hard to restrain himself from beating his fists into the air . The unsociable Silver Elf suddenly looked like he was becoming affable , Brendel looked hopefully at him . <p> He had been relying on numbers from the system to gauge the NPC enemies levels , and had always felt disturbed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used his own experience to recall vital enemies stats and their favored techniques , but there was no way for him to recall every one of them . <p> With the ability Probe , he would be able to see the characters entire list of stats and their skillsets , and once the ability was raised to high levels , the system would even gave an Overall Power Rating . Judging whether they are strong or weak would be a breeze for him . <p> In the game , Marden also taught this ability , but when Brendel tried asking him about it in this world , he discovered that the old soldier did not know that ability at all . When he thought about the reason , he recalled that he met Marden very late in the game and that the latter learned the ability from someone else . ( TL : Marden is the captain of Bucces guards , in case you cant remember . Also I checked this with prior records and I TLed it as exploration back then . Now that the ability is explained clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probe ? " Nalaethar shook his head : " We simply call it Evaluation , if a name is needed . It is something every Silver Elf warrior would learn , so that we can gauge the battlefield with that particular skill . " <p> " Huh ? " Brendel looked blankly at the Elf . " What exactly is it used for ? " <p> He had never heard of a skill like that before . The closest skill to Probe was Eagle Eye , a skill that was much better . Not only did it have the same effects of Probe , there was a chance to steal techniques of the enemies killed . However , he would never be to learn this technique because the person who taught it was against Aouines princess , and he had no interest to betray this kingdom . <p> But he was certainly interested in this new skill that he had never heard before . Given how formidable the Silver Elves were , the skills that they recognized would definitely be good stuff . <p> The Elven commander stared at Brendel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would bring victory to us . I had kept your words in my mind and shall use this skill as a bet . I 'll teach this skill to you if you are able to bring victory to us . " <p> Once the Elven commander finished speaking , he turned his head away and smiled faintly without Brendels notice . <p> Shit , I knew it was n't going to be that easy . Well that 's fine . Both victory and the skill are as good as mine anyways . An unknown skill in the game that I have never seen or heard before .. That 's a little surprising . <p> Suddenly he felt the Nightsong Tigers elbow knocking on his side . He looked at where the latter was pointing and noticed the mercenaries readying their weapons . Even though it was only for a short moment , he knew that the long awaited enemies had arrived . <p> The first group that entered the valley were thirty odd Lizardmen dragoons . <p> They trod under the moonlight and proceeded through the cold boulders , quickly reaching the lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the Lizardmen infantry with lances and crossbows . These monsters were not like a formal army , and the equipment on their bodies were messily put together . There were no banners that they carried , and were comprised of small squadrons led by Lizardmen who wore an armband . <p> The leaders of the small squadrons chattered and made a din , gurgling high pitch noises that kept the individuals who were out of order and their flanks from becoming too scattered . They marched in disorderly lines of twos and threes and did not form a tactical formation because they were still far away from the humans they were after . <p> The long snaking army of Lizardmen passed through the valley , and the mercenaries turned their heads one by one to look for Brendels signal , but he shook his head . The Lizardmen were not the only enemies and it was not the best moment to attack yet . <p> After a few minutes later , the Dark Bishop finally appeared . Because he was not a melee profession , he did not appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch of high ranking disciples . Brendel recognized them easily as high-ranking disciples from their attire , and also spotted two single-armed demons walking along them with large strides . They were called Bachsa ; they were once warriors with great sins cast into hell and subsequently turned into lesser demons which had formidable attacking strength . <p> More than half of the Lizardmen had crossed beyond the mercenaries . <p> Brendel suddenly looked to his left and right before asking : " Wheres Amandina ? " <p> " It seems that Miss Romaine had called her away . " The Nightsong Tiger answered . <p> Brendel answered with a contemplative affirmation . He was slightly worried about that crazy lass causing mayhem again , but he felt better once he heard Amandina was with her . The only thing left to do was to properly handle this battle . He stared at the valley , with the Lizardmen not detecting the killing intent from him . <p> The youth carefully pulled out his sword , taking care to place it under the shadows and pointing to the enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The curtains were pulled back and the battle commenced with crossbows firing at the same time .

Even though most of them did not lose their lives from that , the immense impact had knocked them painfully to the ground and caused them to lose their abilities to continue fighting . <p> " " " " Attack !

He immediately thought that the Lizardmen must have offended this ancient race one too many times and caused them to reappear in this world after disappearing for hundreds of years . <p> I 'm going to kill that fucking lizard Hewjil ! Shit , this is the famous Silver Elven army that participated in the War of the Holy Saints ! <p> The Dark Bishops hands trembled as he stared the Silver Elves who had the strength of the strongest Gold-ranked fighters . <p> He really wished that the Lizardmen were enough to act like cannon fodder and stall for a little time , but it seemed like it was wishful thinking .

Even though the Lizardmen outnumbered them by ten times , they were one-sidedly slaughtered . <p> The mercenaries continued to reload and fire and gave support to the Elven infantry , while Brendel and Nightsong Tiger and the Elven commander stealthily moved at the same time towards the battlefield . <p> Brendel was seeing something that he did not expect as numbers and lights kept flashing in his eyes . His XP was going up all the time . The XP obtained from his mercenaries was one thing <p> Holy shit ! Boosted XP mode because I entered the conditions for a 100% completion rating for this quest ?

It was the best ability any profession that used spells could have , and affectionately called as The Fairys Language by the gamers . <p> All the analysis websites rated the Golden Dawn with a S+ Grade , and was even seen as an option for the warrior class simply because of the stats growth . It was even more compatible with Brendel , because he ultimately had to take on a side profession as an Elementalist to become a Planeswalker . <p> However , he did not hesitate for one moment and refused it entirely . <p> Even though the talent was good , he only had one chance to choose and wanted only the best talents , or at least the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The game had countless gamers vying for the limited professions , but this world was different because there was no one at all <p> He understood there were many opportunities in this world , and the Golden Dawn was merely something that looked decent . <p> He had two Talents he wanted : <p> Primeval Bloodline All Stats increased by 10% , a reduction of 50% in penalty for taking side professions . <p> Classifications above Grandmaster had various names , but the highest of them all was Legendary , and could only be achieved by Genealogy Unification , or at least this was the only method Brendel knew of . <p> The grades of each ability would go up by one when they reached the Legendary tier . Many gamers wondered how overpowered a character would be if they managed to raise their all their professions abilities levels to the max , but that was practically impossible to achieve even for pay-to-win players .

As long as there was a general walkthrough or described process he had read , he was confident that he could do the same like what the previous title holders had accomplished . <p> I 'm not going to make a shitty choice again . Choosing a garbage talent like Unyielding- If I had the choice of choosing the talent Dragons Scion or Ironwill , my combat stats would be twenty percent better .

Even up to till this point , he did not understand that he had being lured into a trap by Brendel , who continued to dodge his arrows . <p> Brendel immediately canceled the Window to stop it from interrupting his mood to fight . Even though it was quite a good talent for a tank there were no warriors in the game who took on the role of tanks , especially when Brendel took on a variant profession as a Mercenary .

Before any of the Lizardmen around the Dark Bishop could react , Brendel had bypassed them to reach the Dark Bishops side . <p> He planted his right foot forward , raised his sword upwards to the sky , activated Power Break and cleaved the Dark Bishop into two that should have happened , but a black shield that reflected no light appeared , and caused a loud clang when the sword crashed onto it . <p> What .. ? <p> Brendel was slightly stunned as he saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly appeared out from nowhere .

If the TSTBGAM chapter is another 3-4k words again , well , the next regular update for TAS will be next Wednesday . <p> I do n't  quite understand what happened there can anyone explain ? What I mean is he got the opportunity to use his new " talent point " in a talent called The Golden Dawn which would give him a 10% stat increase and some other interesting things like casting 4 spells in the same cast and increase his SP which is basically mana , which he will need because he plants to dual-class as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it because that talent while good was n't as optimal as he would have wanted for his future " build " and he wanted that talent point on something that would be far more useful like the two other talents he named , now here is what I do n't  understand did he retaint that talent point so that he can later use it for those other two talents he wanted or was it automatically put into his first talent Unyielding and he lost it all the same as if he would have picked the Golden Dawn talent ? I ask because he got this notice a bit after he cancelled putting the talent point into that awesome but not optimal talent : <p> Your character has reached Level 25 . Your ability has been unlocked for the second time . <p> Does this mean he lost that talent point automatically he did n't  use it in The Golden Dawn talent or did that first talent of his just get upgraded automatically because of him becoming silver ranked ? Does he still have the talent point or was it used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time i checked Brendel does know , that this is no longer a game and there are no respawns , in a game a dps that goes for 0 defense is Ok if you like to get 1 shoted , but this is your life Brendel , that extra HP/Mana/Resistance could decide your life.also not taking the cool talent in hope of geting a nicer one in the future , yeah in the future you can be dead man <p> Let say brandel take a better talent that raised his stats , then he could fight 2 strong warrior and win with ease , , But with his unyielding skill , not only he is n't capable to win against the same 2 warriors , even if its against one warrior he has to risk his life to win , , <p> So even if it sounds " life saving " talent , its actually give more risks than benefits <p> lol , I guess his unwanted child Unyielding-kun will get to shine right after it got deem trashy by its owner by saving him once again . On another note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more 3 than talent point later , perhaps going over lv cap . Actually , is there lv cap in the game ? <p> The problem with this " Unyielding " skill is that you have to die to activate it ! Which means you are weaker than opponent if you let it deplete your HP ! It is " good " skill when you are at low/mid levels , this skill can save you from sneak one shoot attacks , or you can use suicide attacks knowing that it will not kill you ! BUT what about on HIGH levels ? You have large amount of HP/Armour/etc . Having your hp goes to 0 means all this was useless and having few minutes of invincibility wont save you in the end result ! <p> Does " Unyielding " bonuses are passives ? Or only when skill activated ? Because if not , than what the point ? What difference how much you get damage when you cant die ? ! Only pain reduction feeling ?

Even if they retaliated with their own ranged attacks , it was not effective in stopping the Lizardmen warriors from pouring in . <p> However , this showed off the Mercenaries of Lopes strong fighting will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred Lizardmen , giving up their positions twice and took it back two times as well by using Exploding Crystals . <p> The reinforcements that Amandina sent out to help them were rebuffed by the enemies numbers , and the three mercenaries were ultimately overwhelmed by the Lizardmen warriors who swarmed them angrily with weapons and shredded them into pieces . The last person waited till his final breath and detonated the last Exploding Crystal on himself , causing the largest damage to the Lizardmens numbers since the start of the battle . <p> Almost twenty Lizardmen were taken out from that blast . <p> The battles after that were no less bloodier than the first one . The Mercenaries of Lopes were the ones in charge of defending the riskiest chokeholds , and almost every time they battled it was a melee fest that guaranteed corpses . After exchanging twenty two Lizardmen for another four mercenaries , the enemies finally broke through the outer positions and began to invade the ritual hall . <p> The remainder of the mercenaries retreated into the building and defended there , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was less and less room to defend against the enemies . If the defense lines were pushed back any further , they would have to retreat to the roof . <p> Amandina held on to the flag and continued to watch for changes in the battlefield , waiting for an opportunity to order the mercenaries to charge into the enemies weak points . Each mercenarys death made her heart feel heavier . When Brendel was leading these men there was not even a single death , but it was just her mere ten odd minutes of commanding them had caused them to suffer serious injuries and even led them to their deathsWhen the older Elven elementalist sister , Felaern , used her own body to block off a fatal crossbow bolt attack , Amandina felt her eyes tear up uncontrollably . The Elven girl even suppressed her own voice in order to make sure Amandina did not panic . <p> Amandina understood what Falaern was doing and gritted her teeth as she laid her down onto the ground . The latters body warmth lingered in Amandinas hands , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . <p> A handkerchief appeared in front of Amandina . <p> She looked back in surprise and saw Deyna , the younger Elven sister . <p> " Wipe your tears , miss Amandina . " <p> " No , I 'm fine .. " Amandina took a deep breath and then stuttered : " S-sorry .. " <p> Deynas lips moved once and wanted to say something , but she stopped herself . Brendel did not tell her about the secret of the Mercenaries of Lopes , and she did not have the permission to reveal it either . <p> " Please give me the flag , Miss Amandina . This place is too dangerous . " She said after a moment of hesitation . <p> Amandina shook her head . <p> " No , I have to be here . " She needed to do see this to the bitter end . <p> The Lizardmen had already broken the fourth defensive line , and the mercenaries retreated once again . They were close to the roof . From that distance , Deyna estimated there was less than fifty meters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossbows raising towards them . Even though they were not accurate shooters , their repeated attempts will reach the flags position soon . <p> Deyna creased her brows and stood in front of Amandina and reached for her sword . She was out of mana like her older sister . Still , she had to accomplish her task to defend Amandina . <p> " Deyna . " <p> " Yes ? " <p> " Thank you . " Amandina said quietly . <p> The Elven girl smiled faintly , but quickly fell into a solemn expression when her eyes saw that the Lizardmen were chattering amongst themselves . All the crossbows were raised at the same time , and she was not certain whether she could defend against all the crossbows bolts . She gritted her teeth and pulled out her sword , gripping the hilt tightly . <p> The Lizardmens fingers were on the triggers , waiting for the command to allow them to fire <p> Amandina and Deyna held their breaths . No matter how much they prepared themselves for their deaths , there was a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment never came . A small shining crystal suddenly fell onto the ground and in the midst of the Lizardmen . An explosion happened , and the walls were immediately painted with blood and rained across the stairs along with bits of flesh and bones . <p> Everyone was stunned . <p> Amandina was certain she gave all the crystals to the mercenaries at the outer wall ! <p> A sudden clang could be heard from the edge , and she turned her head around to see a sword on the ground . Romaine climbed up onto the roof , appearing utterly exhausted and panting for breath . When she saw Amandina , she gave a smug smile : " Haa I nearly got lost , haa haa It was hard to find a path to the roof Amandina , I learned how to use a sword , I can protect you Haaaaa .. I 'm tired .. " <p> " W-wait , are n't  you supposed to go back and wait ? ! Were you the one who used the Exploding Crystal ? Did n't  you give it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her small bag : " Well .. I might have kept a few . " <p> " Hold on The reason why the explosion failed that night was because there were not enough to break an important section of the hill , causing the rocks to fall around us right ! Damn it , did n't  you say you used them all ? " <p> Romaine jumped up when she heard Amandina curse for the first time . She shook her head repeatedly . " I-I promise I only have five , no , four left . "

Ill be posting the 119-122 which I have spent a ridiculous amount of time on . <p> FF 14 and Persona 5 artbook images . Gosh persona 5 has so much swag and style in it . Im tempted to buy a PS4 to play that game . <p> Chapter 119 The Final Battle ( 7 ) <p> The scouts quickly reported their information . <p> The holy grounds of Baern Shyrltaesi was comprised of the Elves Goddess Temple and two outer courtyards with walls , and was in the center of the Elven ruins , with other buildings surrounding arranged like an axis around it . <p> The grand hall of the Goddess Temple was where Hewjil had occupied previously . The back room led to an altar , while the front of halls entrance was a corridor that led to the rooms where the Elven Priests stayed at . It also had stairways leading to the top of the Temple . <p> Amandina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The mercenaries passed through the ruined walls of the buildings , accepting Amandinas command to enter the temple . The courtyard within the temple was once filled with Silver Elves who came to pray to their goddess , but now that beautiful and tranquil place was in shambles . The elegant white tiles in the corridors were broken and stained with dirt , and the only thing left intact was the pillars . <p> The wind blew softly from time to time , passing through the holes within the walls almost like whispers . <p> In this near silence , three of the Mercenaries of Lopes who set out early were the first to reach the place . They went up to the temples rooftop to deposit a hastily made flag made with a spear and grey cloth torn from Brendels robes , then went out to the second outer walls of the temples courtyards to observe the Lizardmen . <p> Two outer walls that surrounded the courtyard were built by the Silver Elves in order to make defensive lines for the Holy Temple and prevent intruders . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and were nearly gone . There was almost no cover left to stand behind and defend the area properly , and the Lizardmen had not repaired the walls when they occupied it . <p> The Lizardmen did not do so because of two reasons . The first reason was simply because they did not have the ability to repair the walls because of its intricate designs . The walls were built to lure in enemies at certain junctions which allowed the Silver Elves to ambush them , and with Hewjils intelligence , he was never able to figure out how it was supposed to be done . The second reason was the Lizardmen had no need to do so because they had no enemies . In this forest , their worst enemies were themselves and wine , having a hundred deaths nearly every year because they killed each other . <p> The second batch of mercenaries set themselves up at another opening of the outer walls once they arrived . <p> The Lizardmen have passed through the forest- <p> They are approaching the ruins. <p> Their numbers are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mercenaries passed information around through signs , before it went back to the Elementalists sisters who accompanied Amandina and informed her of the situation . <p> She lifted up her skirt as she crossed over the hall quickly , then climbed up the stairs to the rooftop where it was able to oversee the entire area of the temple . <p> The complex defense lines of the temple quickly became clear to her . <p> She looked down and compared the area to the map that was hurriedly drawn by Nalaethar . Her studies in the architecture knowledge was useful enough to recognize the important chokepoints , leading her to turn around and search the area . <p> She straightened the first flag vertically and placed it in the center . <p> As long as the flag was standing upright , it informed Nalaethar and the Nightsong Tiger that the backlines and defenses were not lost . <p> She then gave the orders to the Elementalist sisters , informing the Grey Wolves Mercenaries to defend the fourth chokepoint . <p> The Grey Wolves Mercenaries looked at each other with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Mercenaries of Lopes member accompanying them . <p> Amandinas location was quite prominent . If the Lizardmen broke through the chokepoints , they could easily enter the inner temple and climbed up the stairs to where Amandina was . Brendel had instructed them to protect her safety , but she had ordered them to move far away where she was . <p> " Miss Amandina ? " One of the mercenaries yelled out in a loud voice . <p> " Follow my orders ! " Her reply came back . <p> " But " <p> Amandina flung her hand indignantly : " I 'm your commander now . My orders are your utmost priorities , if there are any objections , you can bring it up to our lord after this is over ! " <p> The mercenaries fell into silence . <p> Amandina suddenly spotted the Lizardmen rushing out of the forest . Their formation was almost non-existent , moving out quickly across the ground for the sake of speed rather than safety . This meant that the leader of the Lizardmen had indeed deduced of their smaller numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she only had a total of fifteen mercenaries under her <p> Even though the mercenaries were much more experienced than the Lizardmen , the latter outnumbered them many times . <p> Delaying them is the best I can do . <p> Amandina gripped the flag tightly subconsciously with gritted teeth . <p> ============= Brendels POV ============= <p> Brendel wiped the sweat of his head . <p> He had already lost count of how many times they escaped Ekmans attacks by mere inches . He could hear his heart pounding loudly because of the constant tension . Scarletts rate of breathing was also beginning to increase , indicating that her stamina was going down . <p> " How long did you say that the warhorse can use charge again ? " Scarlett asked with a panting voice . <p> " Another twenty seconds . " Brendel estimated in his mind . He had used this ability once earlier to cover half of the distance to his destination . <p> " No , if we do n't  fly in the air .. we cant hold on that long ! " She shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a look . <p> He wished that Scarletts answer was different from his own but he knew that was something impossible . He had predicted the same results from the start . Even though the monster was clumsy and slow in turning directions , the speed at which it charged in a straight line was shocking . Each time they turned to pull away from it ended up with the monster gaining back the distance after a few seconds . <p> If they kept changing directions all the time , they would not be able to lure the monster back to the intended location even if the sky turned dark . <p> Flying up to the sky was a temporary solution , but Brendel realized that it was becoming more and more accurate in sending the rock spikes at them . With the nearby trees being destroyed over and over again , the obstructions to the attacks were also becoming fewer . They might as well have a target painted behind their back . <p> " You cant fly up . " Brendel gave his conclusion . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked back again and saw Ekman getting closer and closer . He finally stopped hesitating and threw out an Exploding Crystal at it . The monster covered its head with both hands as the series of explosions happened right in front of it . However , the explosions did not seem to stop it even for a moment , as it charged right out of the smoke and dust . <p> Scarlett felt that threat and forced the warhorse to jump into the air . Ekman did not waste any time and shot the spikes out from the ground at them . <p> Even though Scarlett reacted to the attack as fast as she possibly could , the exhaustion from the long tension had caused her to be slower by a split second . The rock spikes accurately struck the warhorses thigh and caused the entire body to topple , knocking it straight onto a tree . <p> The immense impact caused Brendel and Scarlett to be jerked out from the warhorse , and when they finally reacted from the attack , they realized they were already on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was back at Bucce the first time he arrived there . That feeling of wrecking pain and confusion was almost like a bomb thrown into his mind . But his worry was not about what kind of damage he received from the impact , because the bastard was going to follow up with another attack . <p> Fuck , this time were in grave trouble ! <p> He grabbed the last Exploding Crystal and tried to get up while he shook his head to shrug his dizziness , but before he was able to do so , a hand pressed him down . <p> " Listen carefully . " <p> Scarletts voice sounded like it came from a near and far place at the same time . Even his vision appeared like there were two or three images overlapping each other when he tried to focus on her . <p> " I 'm going to delay that monster and give you some time to escape . " <p> " What are you trying to do ? " <p> Brendel felt pangs of sharp pain in his spine , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Theres no need to worry about me . I 'm also an Acolyte , the most damage that mindless creature would be able to do is injure me if I delayed it for a short while .

" The horse is right behind you . Stop wasting time . " <p> She took up her halberd and turned around to face the monster . It had crashed into a few trees and destroyed them in its charge . <p> Scarlett took up a stance and placed her spear horizontal to her body and gritted her teeth . <p> Brendel looked at her back once more before he grabbed the reins of the mithril warhorse and mounted it . There was no time to waste and argue . Scarlett had made her choice and he could only cooperate with her . <p> This chance would be wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a furious gallop . There was a loud smacking noise , and when he looked back , he saw Scarlett flying backwards like a piece of rock , colliding into trees with audible snapping noises , before he lost all signs of her . <p> Fuck !

This is n't going to work <p> The monster turned to Scarletts direction for a few seconds , when a small crystal knocked onto its head . The explosions happened in front of its face , causing it to turn into Brendels direction again . <p> It was certain that the girl had lost her combat abilities , and thus set its target on the irritating fly . Without a proper order , the Berserk status that it had caused it to kill anything that still moved . <p> Scarletts delay had worked . <p> Brendel was ready to use his Charge ability . He made the horse run off in another direction and activated his ability , causing the speed of the warhorse to move over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed in his previous world . <p> If someone was able to look at him from a hill , they would have seen a blurring silver line cutting through the entire forest .

Lives had no value here . There were black markets behind destitute places like this , and the price of getting a goat was equivalent to the price of getting a slave boy . In some cases , a slave girl was even lower than that of livestock . The settings in the game was now applied in the real world . <p> Anyone who possessed enough power or authority would be able to trample on these citizens . Bandits raped and murdered people .

I should not have said that . " <p> Brendel waved his hand : " Miss Amandina , you 're mistaken . I 'm not holding it against you at all . " <p> Amandina looked up , as if to confirm whether Brendel was telling the truth . She quickly lowered her head again and did not say anything else . <p> " We still need to head south a little more to reach our land .

She knew the term well . Young nobles or knights who had no land to inherit , would receive the authority from the Holy Cathedral of Flames to develop new land for the kingdom . They would bring along a few of their squires and head to the wilderness and develop new cities . <p> These stories sounded like childrens bedtime stories . She did not expect the legends to happen directly to her . She panicked for a moment . Even though it sounded like a great adventure , it was incredibly dangerous . No one in Aouine had tried to develop new lands for over a century , and for a moment she thought Brendel was a madman . <p> But she quickly calmed down . When she compared the days in Bruglas where she was hounded for her fathers debt to Brendels journey , she saw a glimmer of hope . <p> So what if its dangerous ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pioneer Knight . The title sounded like the classic heroes from the past who were full of eager to progress . Even though it was dangerous , there was an air of romance about it . No matter how she looked at him , be it bravery , wits and morals , he fulfilled her ideal standards completely . <p> He was even quite attractive when he dressed up as a noble . <p> Its a pity . He already has someone else . <p> Amandina blinked rapidly as she found her heart beating a little faster , before she looked at Romaine beside her . After her actions of running in the dangerous battlefield twice , she was lectured by him for a long time and was currently kept in check . <p> Romaine was looking at something with interest and called out to him : " Hey Brendel , look over there " <p> She seemed to have a magnetic pull to her ; Brendel and the others looked over to where she pointed . <p> There were many travelers on the street that were not natives <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Divine Artifact Resonance in Randner had circulated to various bars and inns in the kingdom .

Even the Association of Stars and Moon , as well as the Black Tower sent out their scouts . Within half a month , the population of Princess Gryhpines territory actually doubled . If Trentheim was not under the threat of Madaras army , the cities lords would have been delighted at receiving more taxes . <p> The situation is becoming complicated . <p> Brendels eyes swept across them . It was clear that he did not fit in with these adventurers because of his attire , and the adventurers did not fit in with the local natives . This scene looked as though an artist deliberately painted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to get involved with the locals , and the same goes for the latter who wanted to do with these likely lawless lot . <p> However , Romaine was pointing at something else . It was a small group of adventurers who were distributing food to the emaciated children . This sight made him feel there was an illusion where time was going backwards , as if he was in the game world , and these were the sympathetic gamers who were distributing food . <p> He quickly shook his head to get rid of that illusion . There were still young adventurers who pursued their dreams instead of profit . <p> Four men and two women . All of them are indeed in their youths . <p> Brendel could not help but reflect on the reality between fantasy and the real world . Adventurers were not the exciting and romantic life mentioned in fairy tales , and in truth it was bloody and difficult . They had to enter areas fraught with dangers and perils , and it was common for them to meet with their deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the danger they were in , and most of them ended up as bones in unknown places , although there was no lack of people who became rich overnight . <p> Because of this , the majority of the adventurers had to become practical and work for profit . Only the youths who acted upon ideal dreams did something illogical , and he was certain this group of adventurers had just started their journey . <p> The other exceptions were them being the descendants of rich nobles or merchants . <p> " What did you want us to look at ? " He turned his head back to ask . <p> He felt pangs of danger when he saw her pretty , dark brown eyes roll about as though she had thought of something creative . <p> " What are you thinking about ? " Brendel asked while being on his guard against her crazy antics . <p> " Something like what they are doing . " Little Romaine replied as a matter-of-fact . <p> " The food that we brought along is n't enough , Romaine . " Amandina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our men and horses are draining our supplies quickly . If were going to purchase food supplies here , we would have to deal with the local lord . Have you forgotten what happened just a while ago ? " <p> Amandina was referring to the incident when they passed by a low-ranking nobles land . Brendel had gone with Scarlett to negotiate the price of procuring food supplies , but the noble became interested in Scarlett and sent out his personal guards to abduct her . <p> The end results were thirty-odd iron-ranked guards were soundly beaten by the youth , then forced the noble to compensate for his transgressions . However , this event served as a warning . Even though the royal crown still retained its power , the nobles were already abusing their powers . <p> Brendel gave a grateful glance to Amandina when she finished speaking . The previous lord they encountered was still fine , but this time they were going to face Baron Graudin . Even though he was insignificant in Aouines history , his father was Duke Randner . If he tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would definitely send out his army out after his head . <p> In the past , Duke Rhuns army is able to freely move through Duke Randners territory as they pleased . Perhaps the Princesss faction established some form of deal with him . Someday I 'll deal with these parasites , but it will only be when my army is ready and I have enough speaking authority . Power , is still one of the most important rules in this world . <p> Romaine shook her head upon listening to Amandina , gave a mysterious smile and replied : " Do you all not discover it yet ? " <p> " About what ? " Brendel said . <p> " The method to do business " <p> " Huh ? " <p> Brendel took off his glove and brought his hand to her forehead , wondering if she was having a fever , while Romaine swatted his hand away in annoyance . The younger Wild Elf sister asked curiously : <p> " Miss Romaine , my hometown has a saying . Poverty and merchants do not go along with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really business to be done in such a poor place ? " <p> " Tia !

My aunt said that if there are places with transactions to be done , then there would be merchants . " Romaine said . <p> " I do n't  disagree with your aunt , " Amandina looked at the uneven roads . It was highly unsuitable for horse carriages to even pass through the streets at its state . Having commerce in this area was still a long way off : " But this place seems to lack even the basic conditions for transactions " <p> " But are these adventurers not doing transactions right before our eyes ?

That 's at the level of a Blessed character ! <p> Even though Brendel had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritated to see ridiculous talents popping up around him with Gold-ranked abilities and stats . <p> Or maybe I should target the level 25 dragoons or disciples first Hold on , should I go after the Dark Bishop now ? <p> Brendel quickly swiveled his eyes around to look for the Dark Bishop in excitement . His eyes were starting to become bloodshot as he drooled over that sizable XP . However , what he saw was a group of high ranking disciples rushing to the Elven infantry like a wave . He realized that the Dark Bishop did not wish for the Lizardmens formation to break completely . <p> Once the Lizardmens army was cut into half , it would become difficult for the Dark Bishop to give orders , as well as becoming slower to respond to the enemys attacks . He knew that if he lost control of the battlefield , his chances to escape will be reduced significantly , thus he had no choice but to send out his disciples in order to prevent the situation from becoming worse . <p> Ten over disciples brandished their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the Elven infantry had already moved back into position and lined up with Brendel , ready for them . The Lizardmen were impeded by the mercenaries ranged attacks and there were not many obstacles between the disciples and the Elves . <p> If the Dark Bishop was a little better in commanding , he could order the Lizardmen around him to charge at the mercenaries on the hill . This would even the odds a little bit more , but he was simply not suited to lead . The only things he had in mind were to prevent the lines from splitting altogether and protecting himself . <p> After issuing his commands to his men to prevent any enemies from coming near him , he started to prepare his spells , but Brendel had already found him and formed a plan <p> =============== Amandinas POV ============ <p> The war cries in the valley started to mix together and Amandina could no longer discern what was happening . The battle below seemed like it was happening in another world <p> When the cool wind blew over the hills top which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coughed lightly once , before tightening the cloak around herself . She stood alone in the open cliff and looked at her surroundings in slight fear , then turned back to check a certain crevice in the wall and whispered in exasperation : <p> " Romaine , are you still not done ? " <p> " I 'm almost done . " Her voice came back like she was finishing soon . <p> Amandina sighed . She had heard of that answer a few times already , but she knew that Romaine would definitely ignore her grumblings even if she tried , so she could only stomp her feet to get rid of the cold . <p> However , Romaine was really about to finish what she was doing . She went deeper into the narrow crevice and walked in the dark area without hesitation . Any normal person would feel frightened of this tight area that was void of light , but she walked with an excited expression as she reached her destination . She reached into her pouch and pulled out a crystal , bent down to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed the crystal on top of it . <p> She got up and count the places where she laid five other crystals , nodded and finally came out from the crevice with a light-hearted expression . She discovered Amandina with her frowning eyebrows that nearly touched her eyes which were filled with full of discontent and blame . <p> " I 'm regretting this already . Let 's go back now . " Amandina shivered and coughed from the cold . <p> " Do n't  worry , its just a small experiment and Brendel wont notice it at all , " Romaine showed a lopsided grin and pulled Amandinas arm : " Let 's move on to the next location . " <p> " W-wait " <p> " Give me more of that crystal . " <p> " What are you trying to do ! " Amandinas wary hands went over her pouch . It was unlucky enough that that damned girl discovered her secret , but she did not want to have anything to do with her crazy acts . <p> " But your calculations are fine right ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered : " Romaine , you horrible woman , I 'm actually a recognized student in Lantonrands Royal Geology Circle . " <p> Romaine immediately made a disappointed sigh . <p> =============== Brendels POV ============== <p> A Wind Bullet and a Fireball . <p> When the explosion of burning air finally dissipated from the battlefield , the high ranking disciples had been turned into ashes . <p> Ring of the Wind Empress , 20 OZ , 30 damage , Flame ring , 24 OZ , 70 damage . That 's enough to clear out these Silver-ranked disciples . I was worried there might be some elite demons that came along with the disciples , but it looks like my concern was for nothing . If I think about it , they are unlikely to come into this world in great numbers Unless a flag is somehow raised and the Gate of Demons is opened , cough <p> Brendels XP was raised by two thousand points . He was nearly level twenty five . He quickly lowered his sword and gave new orders to the Elven infantry : " Attack the enemies flanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . The BOSS , I mean , leave the leader to me ! Got it ? " <p> Twenty Elves nodded at the same time . <p> " How about me , my lord ? " The Nightsong tiger asked . <p> " Go along with Nalaethar . " Brendel replied . <p> " You do n't  need any help ? " The Elven commander asked . <p> " Just leave the leader to me , I do n't  want that bastard to die off too quickly . " Brendel answered . <p> He had other thoughts about the Dark Bishop . Even though the latter had abilities and stats equivalent to a level 35 normal NPC , his true level was only 25 and Brendel actually had an easier time to deal with enemies with lower levels . <p> Without giving them a chance to argue , the youth charged towards the Dark Bishop , but- two Bachsa demons that were nearly three meters tall were obstructing him . <p> They were aggressive demons who also had the Charge abilities , and could be said to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped before them for a split moment before going around their backs like a stealthy spirit . His hair flitted about as their weapons missed him before they landed onto the ground with a resounding crash . <p> Although the demons had the Charge abilities , their agility was incredibly low and their regular strength were also no match for Brendels strike combined with Power Break . His sword danced across the demons bodies , painting injuries across them one after another as he constantly moved behind them and biting at their backs . The demons were slowly bleeding to their deaths , but they were not even able to catch a glimpse of Brendels appearance . <p> The Dark Bishop did not waste any time and quickly finished casting his spell . He screamed and directed a bolt of lightning towards Brendel who had kept an eye on him . <p> Claws of the Demon , a magic spell of the Third Circle . <p> Brendel easily recognized the magic spell . It was a spell that had two effects . Even though it was based on the Dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the second effect caused a loss of speed . As a magic spell of the Third Circle , the effects were much more effective than an Ice Arrow . It would literally seal the enemy onto the ground with dark energy unless they had over 40 OZ strength , and would only dissipate after a couple of minutes . <p> This spell was one of the most common spells amongst Dark Elementalists and Witches , and were primarily used for a sneak attack . Brendel really wanted to tell the Dark Bishop it should not be used in this manner when he saw this ugly sight . During the early days in the game , players simply used this spell without thinking until much later , where they discovered that it was better used with a combined spell to hide the flashy effects , or even used as a close combat spell . <p> The reason for that was because the spell needed careful aim . <p> When Brendel saw the Dark Bishops hand stretched out , he immediately kicked the Bachsas body in front of him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chained the body onto the ground and spluttered hellfire everywhere . It was an impressive sight , but the spell effectiveness was rendered to zero as it missed its intended target . <p> He then activated Power Break again with an upwards swing of his sword , sundering the other demons neck and arm and instantly killed it with the body parts flying high up into the air . <p> Brendel took a moment to take a deep breath . The recent addition of the Spectral Knights crystal had caused the effectiveness of Power Break to increase his strength to over 30 OZ , but the drain on his stamina was even higher than before . <p> Fortunately , the balls of light that flew from the demons into his body caused him to level up and his body felt lighter than before . Green words streaked across his retina : <p> He always gets to choose his talent ( only 3 are given , and its permanent ) and he can put it off for later if he wants . He only chose Unyielding ( which has proven to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved his life ) back then as the alternative was death . Now that he is in a situation with more leisure , he is free to choose for the long run without risking his life . <p> What this Golden Apple gives ? In Game Brendel said it was rare item which speed up your regeneration of HP ! But what effects it has now ? If Brendel do n't  want use it , this means he know what its other effects ? !

The next battle should be the concluding arc between Brendel vs Conrad . I do n't  think I 'll be updating the JP series because I want to finish something else in the meantime . <p> Engrish mistakes are probably there because I did n't  really have much time left to look at these two chapters . <p> Chapter 111 Planeswalkers Legacy ( 2 ) <p> Creature cards like Vanguards of Blood and the Black Earth Lion , etc , all these are level 20-30 Elites , but they are only useful for short-term benefits . I should invest my points into redeeming the two Fire Land Cards and the only Wind Land Card in the book . Its common sense to have provision first in order for an army to be effective . <p> Brendel gave a long sigh as he closed the book . <p> After that , the next two targets would be the Ocean Gem at 60 Wealth , and the Silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wealth , and the latter raises Reputation . These cards will fulfill my basic needs and I can think about the higher grade cards next . Hmm The Platinum Angel , a level 60 Elite . I would be able to go anywhere in Randners souther region easily if I have that . <p> He had only hoped to get Dark Crystals to summon Medissa for a short time . It was a terrible transaction if he had to spend 15 Dark EP just to summon her , and his Elemental Pools limit was too small to sustain her too . Even though it could not be called the perfect reward because of the limitations , this result was beyond his expectations . <p> With the Land cards he had now , he would be able to maintain her in the battlefield for quite some time . With a Gold-ranked fighter at his side , the southern region and the outer lands that appeared risky to search in was less fraught with dangers now . <p> He even managed to get a card that could dig into his graveyard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Ciel about the ease of getting another Land card later . The younger squire is much more adorable compared to this middle-aged dude who 's not reliable . <p> Brendel finally placed his focus back on the current situation . The explosions most likely alerted Conrad and Hewjil . Based from the information from the prisoners , Medissas pendant was most likely on Hewjil , and the battle ahead was most likely going to be much worse than the battle that he had just now . <p> " Is there anything else ? " Brendel put the book into his bag and looked back at the Nightsong Tiger . <p> " Anything else ? " The Nightsong Tiger looked back blankly . <p> " Things like Dark Crystals . " <p> " Oh , " The Nightsong Commander showed a look of comprehension , " The Dark Bishop left behind quite a bit of them after he exploded himself , but it somehow fused together to the ground . I have already gotten my subordinates to knock them loose . " <p> Brendel nodded as he knew that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gamers easily got forty to fifty crystals from killing a Dark Bishop , and the cheapest crystals around in the auctions were certainly the Dark Element Crystals . Fire Element Crystals were the next in line for the cheapest crystals . <p> " Is there anything else that you discovered ? " <p> " Oh , yes , there 's something strange . " The Nightsong Tiger nodded and took out a black heavy-looking rock : " This was also found by Felaern . " <p> A rock with blood-like spots on them Right , this is the artifact that 's used to control a God Acolyte like Scarlett . Once she is completely turned , she 's no different from a monster and will have lost her original personality . <p> There was the option to use this artifact to control Scarlett who would become something much stronger if she turned , but the youth felt great disdain to watch a person lose her soul bit by bit . <p> He took over the rock and crushed it with his hand <p> " My lord ? " The Nightsong Tiger jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gods to be dormant for a while . Instruct the Grey Wolves Mercenaries to tell that girl to look for me after she wakes up . " <p> The Nightsong Tiger nodded and prepared to leave , but Brendel called him back as he patted his hands to get rid of the rocks residues : " Hold on . " <p> " What is it , my lord ? " <p> " Ciel said that you and him are creations that are rooted in the Dimension Space created by my Land Cards ? " <p> The Nightsong Tiger nodded . <p> Brendel inspected his Land Cards in his mind. - He was like a giant in the air viewing all these areas . In that alternate world , he could see the edge of the Land of the Holy Tree constructed in his mind , with a bridge leading to a black swamp , and at both the edges of these lands was a small town. - The town was most likely Loxars Market . <p> " Are you able to construct things in that area ? " He pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but .. " The Nightsong Tiger hesitated before explaining things in detail : " The core of these areas is certainly comprised of Land Cards , and Resource Cards attached to such Land Cards pay out Wealth and other Resources . While it is true that you can use summons to gather resources from the Land Cards , but my lords powers as a Planeswalker is still too .. unfamiliar . " <p> The Nightsong Tiger tried to find a word to describe Brendels insufficient abilities . <p> " Of course , my lords current cards are inadequate . Ciel is telling me that this Dimension Space can be seen as an entire world by itself . If my lord concentrates on collecting more cards , they would form the shape of this world , and allow it to become the Planeswalkers strength . This world is ultimately formed because of the cards connection with each other . " <p> " I see . " Brendel muttered . <p> " Is there anything else , my lord ?

" <p> =========== Conrad POV =========== <p> When Conrad met up with Hewjil again , it was afternoon on the second day . He had discovered something was wrong during midnight when he heard faint explosions , but Hewjil was so far ahead with his lack of caution that it was only till morning before Conrads dragoon riders under his command reached Hewjil . <p> On the other hand , the dragoon scouts that he sent to the Dark Bishop were still missing . <p> Conrad felt that the situation was becoming worse , and was even out of his predictions . He made sure the dragoons kept in contact with Hewjil all the time , while moving back in the Dark Bishops path with full speed . He was afraid that Brendel and his men escaped with their successful assault on the Dark Bishop and completely left their area of control within this forest . <p> If that was the case , their actions were completely wasted , with the result of losing a leader and soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Brendels plan was to completely wipe out all the Tree Shepherds forces . <p> When he and Hewjil returned to their original point and saw the undisturbed Elven Ruins , they sighed with relief . <p> The ruins were still being patrolled with a considerable amount of Lizardmen . This meant that Brendel and his men did not reach this place yet <p> Perhaps it could be said they had quick reactions to respond to this strange situation . <p> " Conrad , your plan , this is ? " Hewjils narrow face seemed to expand menacingly in an instant in front of the mercenary commander . His emerald eyes stared coldly at him : " Many men lost , when this is over , additional payment . " <p> Conrad snorted coldly in response . He ignored the bastard who was infamous for his cold blooded actions . When did Hewjil gain a heart and cared about his men ? It was all a chance for him to fleece Conrad . <p> I do n't  have time for this . Something is wrong . The Dark Bishop is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , none of us should have any problems to take care of Eke . Did that white-haired bastard lie to me ? <p> Conrad shook his head as he believed in himself . The white-haired youth did not lie . The Lizardmen scouts confirmed the information . But as he tried to cast out these unknown factors out of his mind , someone else was staring in his direction not far from the ruins . <p> =========== Brendel POV ============= <p> Brendels men hid behind the once-grand Elven walls shadows . <p> Everyone looked at Brendel explained his final plan . Their goal was simple . Deal the first strike and made sure it counts enough to be fatal . <p> Thank you very much for the translations . If I may I have a question : do you know if we will ever see in action the other 4 cards that the emperor Tulman gave to Brendel or if we should just forget about them ?

I do n't  undstand how the skill improve and how he can take new one . I mean when he say status i saw that there was a skill empy but a part for that I do n't  undstand the 10ap mentioned ( if i am not wrong ) . It is a point sistem to acquire and improve skill ? And more important does that mean that if he take another class and want to use militia swordman he had to start to raise it from zero wasting point ? Or it is that the more he use the sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved in a more suitable class ? ( if he is in a point system i am guessing that a lot of the skill he started will stay at 0 level for eternity ) . Hopefully he can learn skill to level 0 without having to spend point and with the possibility of changing the class to bypass the level of the class <p> If you had played Final Fantasy before , there 's a particular game in the series that allows characters to switch Jobs/professions . The AP they gained can be put into the jobs , which seems to be similar here . <p> Now , from how I understand it , he gains XP from defeating monsters , so he can level up all his professions without fearing there 's a limitation there , and with each level up from the professions , he gains 10 AP ( or something , author was never really clear in this sort of thing from the chapters ) . Other than putting in AP into the skill set , there is also the option to grind ( like swing the sword 1000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I read that his sword skills go up quickly when he faced highly skilled fighters or something . <p> About gaining new professions , he probably needs to clear conditions or be taught . He got the skill emergency first aid when Freya taught him , so he probably just needs " XXX is teaching you the profession , YYY . Click yes to learn . " <p> The thing I do n't  know is whether the stats are combined . If he gets lvl 30 in Civilian Soldier , and lvl 30 from Swordsman , will the stats be additive or whichever stats gains are highest or if he selects the profession and the stats apply accordingly .

" <p> " In your dreams ? " Brendel asked with some exasperation . <p> " Yes , in my dreams . " She nodded seriously , her smiling eyes forming in a line like she scored a small victory , then ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest . Brendels mood also lifted up when he saw her actions . He was truly fond of her optimistic mindset even under dire circumstances . Every time she smiled , he found his heart getting conquered by her , regardless of the old and new Brendel . <p> Even from the first night in Bucce , he found it hard to take his eyes off her whimsical actions . <p> He took in a deep breath and allowed the cold air of the night to enter his lungs , and slowly cooled down his slightly dazzled mind which was getting hot . When he spotted the Nightsong Tiger , he paused for a moment before moving straight to him while waving the back of his hand at him : <p> " Prepare for battle , the enemy is only two miles away from us . Hurry up , I want all these XP from the two hundred Lizardmen to be taken completely . " <p> Brendel did not like to waste time on pointless banter before the battle . He had explained everything clearly to them and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an operation that required tactical maneuvers like those in the game . <p> " XP ? " Sanford looked like he was confused as he got down from his mount as he heard this unknown word . The Nightsong Tiger merely curled his lips as he glanced at him . He was used to his lord spouting some strange words from time to time . The other mercenaries had even learned what they meant . <p> " I meant that none of these enemies is to be left alive . " Brendel changed his words with a straight face . <p> The Elven commanders lips twisted subtly at the corner without anyone noticing . <p> Brendels orders were quickly executed <p> His men quickly moved in the forest and the youth started to deploy them at strategic positions . He chose to use the most common tactic in the game against these low level mob of Lizardmen . He hid with the Elven commander and the Nightsong Tiger , while the other Elves and mercenaries moved to their designated positions . The Elves armors were made by the Elven craftsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercenaries painted their leather armor black . They hid well enough that even trained eyes would not spot them unless they specifically looked for them . <p> The Elves crouched down behind bushes with a single hand on their broadswords which were covered with fallen leaves , while the mercenaries were approximately thirty feet behind them , waiting anxiously with readied shortbows or crossbows , not daring to breathe loudly . <p> Brendel did not want any deaths in this battle , so he let the Elves lead the forefront while the mercenaries were in charge of ranged suppression . This subconsciously made decision looked like he was taking care of the newly recruited men . Even though Makarov was able to bring victory for them every time , he was a commander who was born in nobility , and the nobles tend to see the deaths of their subordinates as mere numbers . <p> With the high birth rate of Vaunte surpassing the medieval ages birth rates on earth , the rich population was always a resource to be used in the commanders eyes . <p> However , Brendel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , and some of them were obtained from unique missions ; it could be said that every one of them was obtained with effort , and he was reluctant to treat them like cannon fodder . <p> Naturally he did not notice his actions had raised the loyalty from the remnants of the Grey Wolves Mercenaries ; he merely checked the time from the stats window . <p> I have about an hour more . <p> He exhaled and shook his body to get some warmth in this cold forest . He mocked himself a little . It was just a small battle but he actually felt a little tense . He had led so many battles in the game against Madara forces , and even did so in this world by leading the refugees , but here he was , almost like a new soldier who was participating in battle for the first time . <p> I have n't done an ambush against such numbers for quite some time . My heart seems to be beating faster . <p> He looked at the constant numbers fluctuating in the Stats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both projectile and magic constantly , and he felt like it did not fit reality . Brendel blinked a few times before he checked his own stats : <p> ( TL : The stats are inclusive of the bonuses as stated by the author . Strength is n't 19.5 but 19.4 . Also , his intelligence has not grown since the start of the series . Brendel is currently below level 25 , and still classified as a Iron-ranked fighter . ) <p> My stats are almost at a Silver-ranked fighter . If I gain another level I will definitely reach it . But compared to my basic stats , my techniques are truly outstanding . The encounters in this world are much better than the last , Power Break and the White Raven Sword Rave are pretty much the best techniques for a warrior . <p> He could not really remember how he was able to survive back then in the game with his basic stats and techniques . Right now with his current skillset , he was truly invincible amongst his enemies at his level . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could fight against against a mid level Silver-ranked fighter . If he combined his experience in the game , he could even go against the Gold-ranked fighters who had not unsealed their Element . <p> Brendel rubbed his forehead as he pondered on several things , before he suddenly turned to the Elven commander and asked : " Are your techniques from the Holy Land ? " <p> The Elven commander was taken slightly aback , but he immediately looked back with a little caution . <p> " Do n't  worry , I know your rules . I haw no interest in your Elven techniques but I 'm just a little curious . " Brendels mind said otherwise , of course . If he had a high renown he might have a better answer from the Elven commander . <p> " Even if I tell you about them , you would n't be able to learn because our Elven techniques are designed specifically for us , human . " The Elven commander replied coldly . <p> There was a scene in Brendels mind where he was pulling the Elvens commander cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as clear as the nose on your face ! <p> He had learned the Silver Elves techniques before but he did not break his lies and merely smiled : <p> " Come on , Ser Nalaethar , do n't  be so cold . You experienced the War of the Holy Saints right ? " <p> The Elven commander eyed him coldly , not understanding how the topic turned to that , but he still nodded . <p> " Have you learned any Dark Techniques ? " <p> " No . " Nalaethar snapped . His eyes glared at him , while his lips parted again to say something before he resisted doing so . Any Silver Elf who learned Dark Techniques meant they had joined the faction of the Dragon of Darkness . Even though he thought Brendel was being sarcastic to him , he convinced himself that the latter was innocent . <p> Very few people in this era would know that era well . <p> Unfortunately Brendel was one of them , and he was indeed making fun of him . <p> Nalaethar was silent for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to learn something , human ? " <p> This time it was Brendel who was surprised . His mouth went open but he did not know how to respond . 
@@37042164 @6042164/ <h> The Amber Sword Volume 2 Chapter 103 <p> Aakkin was the commander of a dragoon squadron . His orders were mostly straightforward amongst his usual missions , to either assault or pillage . However , he would sometimes take on the scouting role which was one of his most hated missions . It was too dangerous , especially in the forest where technical expertise was more important than speed and agility . He also disliked the fact that he could not use his best qualities in this role . <p> He raised his head and took in the golden rays of the rising sun . He trembled as the suns warmth drove away the vestiges of the cold night and permeated into his blood . He shook his head in annoyance before sniffing the air , trying to discover any signs of the humans he was tasked to search for . <p> In his eyes , the silence in this valley was quite odd . <p> He did not like the eerie peace because it was the calm before the storm , like how a poisonous snake was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The northern Chablis region was like an ocean of trees , and he felt that it was impossible to find the humans in this huge forest . <p> Still , he cautiously gripped his spear and raised his right hand , pointing all his three fingers into the forest ahead of him . He chattered a series of noises , ordering his men to spread out and search . <p> He did not realize he made a mistake . <p> He only reacted when his men suddenly disappeared without a trace ; his first thought was to retreat and find an excuse to explain to his commander Hewjil as to why he sent four dragoons to their deaths . <p> He did not find an easy answer . Even though Hewjil was a irregular amongst the Lizardmen who was churlish , he was considered to be sharp and Aakkin did not think him easy to fool . <p> But there he soon discovered there was no need to worry over it . <p> That was because he saw a human and Elf waiting when he turned around . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he only knew that it was a Silver Elf staring coldly at him . The Lizardmen had recently caused trouble near the temple so Aakkin had an idea of what race he was from . <p> The Silver Elf had an Element power gathering on his armor . <p> The only thing that Aakkin could do was to surrender . A small mistake of spreading his men out , allowed each individual to be caught without any commotion , and was enough to seal his fate . What was fortunate the two men who caught him seemed like they did not want his life for the time being . <p> At the same time , he understood as a scout that his current fate would not last for long . He would be allowed to live for a while before they obtained the information they needed , be treated like a burden and disposed of in the end . <p> But death was not the most terrifying outcome . If the human and Silver Elf were scouts like himself , then they would know of many ways to make him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veteran as a scout , and even more experienced as a bandit , so he was certain of what was coming next . He was not afraid , because he intended to spill everything out if they interrogated him . <p> There was no sense of dignity amongst the Lizardmen , especially so as a bandit . <p> His limbs were securely tied up with ropes so he studied the surroundings he was brought to . The other four dragoons were lying dead in front of him . He strangely discovered that he was the only one alive and it made him slightly puzzled . Did they think that a single Lizardman was enough to get accurate information ? <p> He suddenly realized that he was in considerable danger . <p> Who are these men ? What do they want exactly ? Aakkin wondered in his mind , before light was blocked in front of him . He looked up and saw the human and Silver Elf standing in front of him . He gulped immediately and his eyeballs turned to both at them in succession . He was willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly could he do to keep his life ? <p> Brendel was also staring at him while he considered this difficult question , <p> If I think about it , there are differences going from a console controller to a computers keyboard and mouse . No matter how close it is in the game to this world , I need to get used to this worlds characteristics and social state . <p> Brendel stood in front of the dragoon and carefully studied him before smiling . <p> He knelt in front of Aakkin , reached out with his hand and patted his rough and narrow face , and spoke with a gentle voice : " I know what you are thinking . You are wondering what kind of questions I would ask , which you would then tell me everything you know about them . After that you would ask me to spare your life , right ? " <p> Aakkins mouth opened wide , displaying over a hundred sharp teeth . He had prepared himself to face his enemys questions but he did not expect to receive this answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punched straight on . He shook his head once as he did not understand how the human knew what he was thinking . Did the human read his mind ? <p> If that was true , did it not mean there was already no reason to keep him alive ? Aakkin trembled . He did not hope to live , but he hoped that he would at least be spared from any torture from these terrfiying enemies . He stared cautiously at Brendel with his diamond-shaped pupils . <p> " Afraid ? " Brendel asked again . <p> When he spoke , soft giggles could be heard from behind his back . He could discern who they were ; Romaine , Amandina , the twin Elementalist and many of the Mercenaries of Lopes were amongst the giggles . Brendel fumed for a moment , grumbling in his mind to tell them to give him a little respect . Did they not see he was trying to work seriously here ? <p> But this was something that could not be helped . The truth was that he tried this with every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other mercenaries were really surprised by Brendels words , before they discovered that he was just pretending to know what they were thinking . <p> He attempted several times to adjust each interrogation method he learned in the past , based on his previous experience with the various NPC bandits . <p> But Aakkin did not have the mood to care what the others were thinking . He was completely afraid of Brendel , and was almost certain that this human was a wizard , one who was frightening enough to be able to see through his mind . <p> Brendel took out a ruby from his pouch and shook it in front of him : " Try answering my question " <p> Aakkin looked at him in confusion and tried to respond , but he realized there was no voice coming out from himself .

Aakkin could only look at Brendel in fear , not understanding why he stole his voice . <p> Brendel covered the ruby and took away the Silence spell . He looked at the energy left through the system and saw that it still had six uses left . Then he sternly said to the Lizardman : " Do you understand ? I can take away your ability to talk and I can return it to you . The voice is part of the soul , and I am capable of taking away not only your voice , but your soul . " <p> The youths voice turned cold and merciless : " A body can decay but the soul lives on forever . The torture on a body can only last so long but have you seen a soul being burned for all eternity ?

The atmosphere made him a little tense , but the instinct to live overtook it . He took a deep breath to regain his composure and walked up to his chief . <p> That Lizardman who reported to Hewjil seemed to finish what he was saying and turned to leave under Hewjils indication , passed by Aakkin and left the hall . <p> The blackmailed Lizardman did not dare to look at him or Hewjil and walked on the red carpet with his head lowered , and allowed him to spot two other pairs of human boots at the edge of the carpet .

Plenty of things to improve on for sure . <p> Chapter 3 Freyas calvary army <p> The bar owner fell into silence after hearing Freyas answer , and she saw an unconvinced expression on his face . She looked around the street and discovered that the people had the same attitude as the bars owner . Her heart tightened and she gripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground to release the tension in her . <p> " Freyas friend had said that Fortress Riedon was going to fall , and everyone here would not believe something like this before tonight . I do n't  believe it either , but the truth is right before us . Freya is Bucces militia and I think she has a way out of this . " Sue suddenly spoke at this moment . <p> Everyone paused , and even Freya looked at the girl . Freya cast a grateful glance at her . <p> " I actually do n't  have the means to avoid Madara . " Freya thought for a while and spoke honestly , but everyone was momentarily stunned from her words . She continued speaking . <p> " But , I know someone who might have this ability . " <p> " You mean you are not even sure whether that person can avoid Madara ? " Someone asked . <p> Freya nodded , and immediately saw many of them shrugged . These mercenaries did not put their hope onto a girl like her , even adopting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to be considerably charming . <p> " Wait , please ! I know , as a stranger , it must look ridiculous to ask everyone to trust me , " She struck the sword against the ground , and composed herself . Her voice became clearer and louder " Im just offering you a possibility <p> She thought for a while : " Its like a b-bet , I , I. " <p> She struggled for a long time , but could not find an appropriate description to use . She started to regret her choice to try and explain in a manner that only mercenaries would be familiar with . <p> " Like setting our bets down on gambling dice right ? If we get it right , we will win big ? " One of the gigantic mercenary soldier laughed : " That 's a good explanation , Call me Mano , yeah ? So missy , I just need to lay down my bets right ?

I think if you see my friend , you will be able to judge for yourself . At the very least , I trust in him . " <p> The mercenaries fell into silence once again . They felt that her proposal had merit to it , and Sue had guaranteed Freya as a reliable person . There was also the fact where they were going nowhere with their own debate , and could go their separate ways if things did not turn out well later on . <p> However , no one wanted to be the first to volunteer , and the atmosphere was growing colder by the minute .

" <p> " Where has your dignity gone to ! " <p> Everyone started making a din , but they basically agreed with Letos words . The bar owner shrugged off the pointed criticism and looked smug . A few moments later , they made a head count on the number of people who did not want to go . The twenty odd people that remained behind was somewhat interested in her proposal , but their pride refused to go along with a young girl like her and act under her orders . <p> " Well then lass , the ones who are going with you are here . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leto folded his arms and asked . <p> The mercenaries understood there were no free meals in this world .

I just want all of us to escape from this place . If you choose to trust and join me , I hope .. that you will listen to my orders and commands , otherwise our agreement will lose its meaning . I know this is a little offending , but I have to insist on this issue . If you have any problems with it , I will not enforce this . " <p> " This is certainly the basic thing that we need to do .

Hmm <p> " Does everyone know how to ride a horse ? " <p> " Of course . " <p> " Then were going to steal some horses . " Freya replied . <p> - - ( TL : Princess POV ) <p> " Steal horses ?

These mercenaries are considerably formidable , able to become soldiers of the kingdoms frontline army . " <p> The princess nodded . Aouines frontline armies were different from the others . There were a few designated armies such as the Imperial Guards , Silver Wing Legion , as well as Seifers 11th calvary corps . The regular soldiers maintained its strength at the Iron-ranked status , and were a few cuts above the White-mane army . <p> As for the other regular regiments , their abilities were even lesser , and their battle prowess were no different from the nobles private army . <p> With Oberbecks description , the half-elf princess understood the strength of the mercenaries who were with Freya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The things that happened next is the most interesting portion .

I only hate Polygamy since I 've seen it over 100times in Japanese Lns . But in this novel I can ignore haha . Please make a drawing of Freya next ! Do you have a DevianArt ? <p> I agree with you . These kinds of flashbacks are not meant to be read slowly in small parts . It also does make it refreshing that it is told in a story teller kind of way since we can get a perspective of the princess while also getting information on the details of the capital ( we know that there is an academy that Freya would probably join .

Anyway , nice drawing ! Tough I personaly prefer more " macho " characters ( like Gattsu is cooler than Griffith ) . <p> I actually like the perspective changes . We have established an in narrative narrator which gives the author a lot of leeway with mistakes and also hiding information from us as readers which usually leads to a better story than 3rd party omniscient narration and I 'm pretty much assuming this entire section of the story is a prologue for the main story . <p> We all already know that Brendel and Co will escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  see why people are complaining that this has been confirmed for us.

" Count Barres eyes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POV ============= <p> In truth , the battle that she was supposed to be in was undertaken by the senior squires in the academy , led by the reserve officers in the graduating class . When Freya and newer members like herself reached the battlefield in the forest , their task was taking care of the battles aftermath . <p> She immediately noticed a carriage filled with bolts and arrows like a porcupine in the center of the road . There were cavalry equipped with silver armor riding near the carriage , with many of their comrades dead bodies on the ground . They refused anyone from approaching the carriage , and insisted of taking care of their injuries as they cleaned up after their own . <p> There were two clear colors . Purple and silver . The bodies with these two colors were strewn everywhere . Heavy groans from the injured , mingled with low frightened murmurs from the newly arrived nobles sons and daughters , could be heard everywhere . They were seeing this bloodied sight for the first time . <p> The reserved officers wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squires to intentionally maim the attackers , and had left many of them alive . However , once they took enough prisoners to be satisfied with , the remainder was ordered to be killed , and this task was also left to the new members of the academy . <p> Many of them found their weapons shaking , unable to swing it , and there were even a few who vomited as they saw the bloodied mess from the ones who were brave enough to attempt it . <p> Freya had fought enough in real battles not to be shaken by the sight and faithfully did her job . She had only paused in the beginning to guess the identity of the people within the carriage . Sangany followed behind with a sick face . He had expelled everything he had for his meals , and he could only heave weakly after that . <p> He held himself against up a tree , while being impressed by Freyas clean strikes to the enemies . She was certainly an admirable maiden . <p> " Do you know who that is ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? " Freya looked back at him with incomprehension . <p> " The carriage . " <p> She took another look at the carriage , then shook her head , her clear eyes showing that she did not understand . <p> " The insignia on the carriage is a Holy Beetle . There is only one person within the kingdom who has this . " <p> " And ? " <p> You do n't  even know this ? How did you even manage to come to the academy Wait , is she bluffing ? <p> The youth looked at Freya in incredulity , but he did not find any signs of deceit in her , so he shook his head and answered : " Grandmaster Fleetwood , the courts First Wizard of Aouine . " <p> " What ! " Freya was shocked . <p> But Sangany shook his head : " If that is truly Grandmaster Fleetwood , there is no need for us to go into battle . The person within the carriage is very likely to be someone else . And yet , Grandmaster Fleetwood has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who could borrow his carriage , is either the king , or his student . " <p> " Her royal highness ? " Freyas eyes were wide . She still know this common knowledge even though she came from the borders . <p> The youth nodded . <p> Suddenly a black warhorse passed by them quickly . The rider swiftly rode through the forest , before the warhorse suddenly stopped , turned around in a trot and moved back the two of them . <p> Freya and Sangany looked up , and found a beautiful but cold face . <p> Her appearance was something like an artistic artifact , it was rare to find such perfectly shaped features . Her sharp chin was a strong arc that led into high cheekbones and deeply set eyes of a pure purple . <p> Her central parting of her fringe led down to her fine eyebrows , which was raised slightly before lowering in displeasure . Her straight nose bridge seemed to reflect her extremely strong character . <p> The two of them instantly thought of the bards descriptions of the beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoff as Maynild looked down at them from the warhorse , first at Freya , then at Sangany . <p> " Your name is Freya ? " She asked a question while she stared at the young man , making the latter feel like he was being targeted by a predator . <p> " Y-yes . " Freya answered . <p> " The results for your riding and sword skills are excellent . " She said in a low magnetic voice : " I have heard of your tale as well , but if you want to accomplish something , you had better leave scum like this man here behind . " <p> There was great disdain in her eyes as she spat out the last few words . <p> The two of them looked blankly at her . <p> Sanganys eyebrows frowned and he tried to refute subconsciously : " Miss Maynild , even though you are Madames " <p> But his words were cut off by a metallic screech , and felt his neck slightly colder . When the youth understood what happened , Maynild had actually jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing it against his neck . Her actions were done in a single second , and he was left frozen with a gesture that he did halfway before it was finished . <p> " Have I given you permission to speak ? " Maynild spoke in a chilly voice . <p> Sanganys back was cold from sweat , but he did not reply because of his confusion . <p> " S-Sangany " <p> " Your rank ? " <p> " M-Miss Maynild , I " <p> The sword in her hand pressed ever so slightly against his neck : " Ser . " <p> " S-Ser Maynild . " Sangany swallowed and answered with a stutter . " I 'm a second year squire , I have no rank yet " <p> He did not waste any more words , and used all his strength in his body to squeeze out the answer . <p> Maynilds sword was sheathed back so quickly that the two of them could not see it done properly . She glared coldly at the youth who was cursing in his heart , then gave an order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut your mouth " <p> She finally looked at Freya properly , then adjusted the latters collar which was a little crooked from cleaning up the battlefield . She patted her arms and said softly : " Remember my advice , it wont harm you " <p> Freya was also in a state of confusion with quick thoughts swirling through her head <p> Should I thank her ? She was really amazing with her sword . Can I be someone like her ? Perhaps someday .. <p> ============ Princess Gryphine POV ============ <p> " Who is she ? " The half-Elven princess asked the young man beside him . The scene where Maynild and Sangany exchanged words happened to fall into her eyes . She looked at Freya , finding that there was a sliver of familiarity . <p> " Madame Idas daughter . Duke Rhun is her uncle . Shes quite talented and an ardent supporter of the royal crown . We should be able to trust her . " Ser Benninger looked over to her direction and said . <p> Gryphine laughed at the silly response : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is . You even know she 's my close friend . " <p> " I apologize , my lady . " Benninger answered in embarrassment . <p> " I 'm talking about the other girl , do you recognize her ? She looks familiar . " <p> " Thats Evertons daughter " A warm voice came from outside the carriage . <p> Gryphine was slightly surprised , but her light silver eyes immediately shone with delight . <p> " Oberbeck ? " She spoke softly . <p> A laugh came from the outside . " Yes , your highness . It seems that I am late . " <p> TL : One thing I want to keep in mind . Anyone close enough to the princess and is a male knight , I 'll use My lady instead of your highness . <p> it would not make sense to have sent her to the royal academy and to pull her away . The point here is she has a very good chance of becoming close to the princess and a perfect persona to give him a introduction . She could also become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ princess with arousing to much suspicion . <p> I think what Wolfie means is that the knight is the princess personal knight , hence the use of my lady . I am not sure if that 's the case though . Its kind of like how a king is usually referred to as your majesty but to close retainers there may be occasions where they address the king as their liege or lord instead , even though a lord is obviously lower than a king . <p> It do complicated . What I want to convey is that " addressing " the a royal princess as My lady would ONLY be okay IF the " royal princess " herself OKAY with or prefer it . It would be another matter though if the princess is not a direct line to throne or she already announce her " disinheritance " toward the crown . Still , a simply noble knight does n't  have right to decide what their master/lordship " preferences . <p> Princes and Princesses in the middle ages , were actually referred to as Lord ( Name ) or Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given a title or acquired one through marriage . <p> Your Grace : appropriate for a male or female noble of the rank of Duke or higher . Also appropriate and common for members of the direct royal line , to include the Queen . <p> My Lord/My Lady : The form of address for any noble or " lord of the Church " such as a Bishop . NOT appropriate for a knight . Other forms include " Lord " , " Lady " or Your Lordship/Your Ladyship . As a title , it is followed not by the given name , but by the place of which the person is lord or lady " Lord Burghley " was actually named William Cecil , but he was the Baron Burghley . 
@@37042172 @6042172/ <h> The Amber Sword Volume 2 Chapter 104 <p> TL : Alright guys , that 's the last chapter . I 'll see you next wednesday ( unless there are any donated chapters ) . <p> Chapter 104 Lure ( 3 ) <p> At the same time Aakkin planned his maleficence , Conrad and the Dark Bishop were observing the new Lizardman who came in . But what made them feel wrong with this scene before them was how the Lizardmens faces all looked the same . At least from their point of view , the lizard who came in earlier did not look any different from this lizard . <p> Perhaps their patterns on the skin were different ? <p> Hewjil recognized his subordinate and asked in his own native tongue : " Aakkin , you came back earlier than I expected . Why , did you find your targets ? " <p> " Yes , chief . " Aakkin answered with a stuttering chatter . <p> His attitude did not draw Hewjils suspicion as he wanted deference from his subordinates , but he was a little annoyed at Aakkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When did you become inarticulate , Aakkin ? If you have anything you want to report , just spit it out . What else did you see ? " <p> " My men and I were attacked in the southern area . " Aakkin gulped as he continued to chatter . " The people who attacked us seemed to be the men we are supposed to look for . There are fifteen of them , two female , and a youth who is leading twelve guards . They are really formidable , and before we could react four of our brothers .. " <p> " The south ? " Hewjil answered blankly , as if he did not hear the loss of men : " Are you sure its the south ? " <p> Aakkin was also in a daze as he thought his chief would go into a rage . But he quickly recovered and nodded . <p> " What did he say ? " Conrad had no more patience when he heard them talk in their native language . When Hewjil raised his voice , he knew something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hewjil smacked away his hand and yelled out : " This time , in the south region . Conrad , your foes , they playing hide and seek with us ? " <p> " They are appearing in the east , south and southwest . " The Dark Bishop was thoughtful : " This goes against common sense , there has to be a scheme somewhere . " <p> " Damned your scheme , " Hewjil growled loudly : " The situation , simple . Enemies discovered where we are , that shitfaced youth you sent to bite them , is definitely killed already . They are escaping to the south ! In three separate routes ! They are dividing focus , I have seen enough of these ploys ! " <p> " Impossible ! " The Dark Bishop nearly jumped out from his chair : " That fool went with my acolyte , " He grabbed a crystal out from his robes with his bony fingers : " This crystal has not cracked , which means my acolyte is still fine ! " <p> " Then your , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words out coldly with sarcasm dripping in his voice . <p> " An acolyte of the Gods losing her way ? Have your brains rotted , you witless lizard ! " Conrad interrupted Hewjil and blocked the Dark Bishop from attacking the latter with his arm . He roared at the Dark Bishop : " Why are you losing your temper ! That lizard is right in saying that the enemies have discovered our intentions . They wont break through the north any longer and they are sure to retreat . We cant wait for them here any longer . " <p> " Then what should we do ? " The Dark Bishop asked after looking blankly at Conrad for a while . <p> " Of course we need to chase them . " <p> " Into which direction ? " Hewjil snapped . <p> Conrad gave him a piercing look and answered in a tone void of warmth : " Are you truly brainless ? Are there only three of us here ? What about your men , you imbecile , of course were going to divide our forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere ten odd Silver-ranked guards defeating our forces ? " <p> Hewjils mouth opened , but found his voice dying in his throat as he discovered the damned human was right . His tone was slightly deflated as he asked : " Then when do we set out ? " <p> " Of course we should set out right now ! " Conrad said . <p> " No , this time we need to be cautious . " The Dark Bishop stopped him : " When my men are here to rejoin me , we can set out in the night . " <p> " You 're too cautious . By the time we set out , they will be way ahead of us . " Conrad grumbled , although he also shared the same concern of a trap when he heard the reports from the Lizardmen . <p> The two men glowered at him in disgust . The three figures did not pay attention to Aakkin who was secretly relieved . <p> What did that terrifying wizard say ? If I am not dead when the moon is up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pounding and he shivered . Would that cunning wizard keep his promise ? <p> Night quickly arrived . Conrad and Hewjils men acted first . Hundreds of fire torches could be spotted near the Elven ruins . This gathering of Lizardmen was highly unusual and complicated , especially when they had no notion of gathering as a unit before . Grouping them up and dividing them into separate forces was a huge task . <p> After an hour later , another long snaking group entered the ruins from the west , and they carried fire torches with them as well , with the gathered torches lighting up the entire area with a fiery red hue . <p> At this moment , four shadows were waiting at the top of a nearby hill <p> " The disciples have gathered . " Countless lights were reflected in Brendels eyes as he spoke . <p> " So are Conrads men . " Sanford chimed in . <p> Brendel nodded . <p> " Are you sure they will divide their forces into three , my lord ? " Sanford turned to him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme and concentrate their forces ? " <p> " There is no if here . " Brendel firmly said . If he was fighting against Madaras talented commanders , his tricks would not work , but he was facing a bunch of Lizardmen bandits and mercenaries . Based on their quality , they would never be able to guess what he planned to do . One clear advantage he had was knowing how much men they had , while they only knew that he had twelve guards with him . <p> Under this situation , none of the enemy commanders would even consider that he had an additional squadron of Silver Elves and that he planned to consume them as experience points . Even if Brendel went up to them and personally told them he was going to wipe out this thousand odd Lizardmen bandits , they would think he had lost his mind . <p> Brendel was quiet for a moment before he replied : " Even the worst outcome now would be the enemy forces gathering into one direction , but we are already here and ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the hunters and we are the prey . In this hunt , the party that decides where the battle would be , is the prey and not the hunters . " <p> Sanford nodded as he listened quietly . <p> The Elven commander stood there quietly . At this distance away from the Altar , he felt a great limitation on his strength , and he did not see any better than Brendel did . The last person that stood behind them was Romaine . <p> She saw much more than the others did when she looked at the field of fire torches . These lights appeared like stars gathering in the darkness to form a painting , and she thought it was truly beautiful . <p> Very soon , the fire torches started to spread out and reform into three straight lines . <p> " You were right , my lord ! " Sanfords eyes brightened up and he exclaimed excitedly , but his expression quickly darkened as he saw an image of Makarovs confident figure on Brendels back . In the Grey Wolves Mercenaries hearts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory was Makarov , but now it was proven that was merely their wishful thinking . <p> Brendels reactions were not as unsteady as Sanford . The curtains on this play had just been lifted and about to begin . He pointed towards the front of the fire torches : " Romaine , are you able to see the appearances of the leaders ? " <p> Sanford and the Elven commander were startled . How was she able to see that far ? They were approximately four kilometers away from the enemies , and the fire torches were about as bright as a firefly , and it was quite impossible for them to even see the figure carrying the torches . <p> They suddenly realized that the girl who came with them was not an ordinary person as she nodded immediately : " Of course I can ! Hmm . The one of the left looks like a lizard . " <p> " Thats the commander of the Lizardmen , Hewjil . Continue . " Brendel was confident of her abilities . She was able to spot the Madara army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starlight or moonlight . In this clear night , along with the fire torches , she definitely found it easy to see what they looked like . <p> " The leader of the center group seems to be a human . He s a young man wearing leather armor .. And there seems to be something strange following next to him . " Romaine carefully described what it looked like , and Brendel replied : " Thats Conrad and the Earth Bishop . Strange , if those two are together , then who is leading the third group ? " ( TL : I 'll see what happens in the future when Brendel encounters the Dark Bishop and Earth Bishop . Currently I 'm using Bishop because I do n't  know what the appearances of the bosses are , but I might change it to Avatar of Earth name ? and Avatar of Lightning Scarlett in the future to differentiate them . ) <p> She nodded and her gaze moved over to the third group and described what she saw . <p> " It looks like the figure is wearing a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cant see anything further than that . " <p> Brendel took a while to think about it : " Hmm Its a Dark Bishop . That means that bastard Redi was talking about him and not the Earth Bishop . The one who cursed Scarlett should be him , but judging from the strength of the curse , he is n't one of the higher ranked members of the Tree Shepherd . " <p> " My lord , do we stick to the plan ? " Sanford asked with concern in his voice . <p> This is a problem . The plan was to kill off the Earth Bishop alone , but if that boss is moving with Conrad then the entire battle would be extremely tough . The worst outcome is letting both of them flee without being able to stop them . This level 50 boss is the rough equivalent of a level 65 creature , and against the weakened level 35-40 Silver Elves With another Gold-ranked fighter like Conrad , trying to get both of them would be difficult . Luring them into a trap will obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. <p> Brendel rubbed his forehead . He needed to gain the best results from this trap . He agonized over the situation for a while , should he kill the Lizardmen or the Dark Bishop ? <p> Wait , the Dark Bishop ? Holy shit ! Dark Bishop ? ! Isnt he a dark elementalist ? I should smack myself for being an idiot . Killing him would mean I can get dark elemental crystals , and heck , the Dark Bishops are famous for dropping nothing but crystals . Even the gamers called them one of the poorest mob creatures around . <p> Brendels mind was used to think about the overall picture , and actually forgot that he could really use some dark elemental crystals . ( TL : To summon Medissa , in case anyone is wondering . ) <p> Once he thought about it , his mind seemed to clear up and even predicted how the future events would flow . If the Dark Bishop died , the Blood of Gods in Scarletts body would also be suppressed because of the lack of control , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He clapped his hands and said : " No , were not retreating . I want to go after the Dark Bishop now . " <p> Everyone did not understand why he changed his mind so easily . <p> Brendel patted the stolen Lizardmans mount and made the beast turn its body . He smiled with embarrassment : " Its common to change a plan when there are unforeseen circumstances . Do n't  worry , this does n't  affect things . In any case , we should return to our ambush location , I do n't  want to get caught in a battle here . " <p> Thank you for the translations , and finally a nice end chapter , with no dreadful cliffhanger to consume our souls ( lol ) . On a side note , do you have a schedule up for the series ? Because I remember you talked about it some chapter ago , but I cant find it . <p> Typically I 'm supposed to update 1 TAS chapter every wednesday until I proofread the older chapters on the older series ( which I would then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of busy catching up on some real life stuff ( excluding the gaming stint ) . <p> The highest thing on my to-do list is to draw stuff first , then creating some sort of auto-update script that links chapters automatically , preferably to be done within the next two weeks .

" As one would expect from the experienced cunning fox , Makarov smiled and asked in a well meaning way after overcoming his shock , as though he was not the cause of Brendels troubles : " We did not expect to meet you again after we got separated from the ambush . " <p> You fucking bastard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take zero responsibility for your shit ? Are you really treating me like a naive kid ? <p> However , Brendel did not display his fury and even smiled back , patting the lifeless head of the Acolyte of Earth : " Nope . This enemy is not strong enough to cause me any trouble . Its a pity that you fled so quickly last night , I could n't even react fast enough to lend you aid as allies . I sincerely apologize for that . " <p> Both of them exchanged barbs with each other . Their skills at spouting bullshit seemed like a stalemate , but Makarov was on his guard because he was not certain whether Brendel knew the whole truth or because he was angry at his actions at the night of the ambush . Brendel appeared like he had many facets to him in contrast to his youthful appearance , and Makarov felt it was difficult to deal with him in such a short notice . <p> Even to the point where he had to ignore Brendels sarcastic remarks . <p> Ultimately he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at the area behind Brendels back . He hesitated for a while before he asked : <p> " Mister Brendel , did you see anyone else passing by here ? " <p> " Perhaps you mean to find a young man ? " Brendel asked innocently while suppressing his laughter . <p> " Yes , we are indeed looking for a young man ! " Makarov answered as the people behind him also appeared anxious . <p> " You know him ? " Makarov took a step forward and his words left him before he could stopped himself . He realized he had overreacted and coughed once , before he returned to where he was . He looked at the Buga and the old man beside him . Buga was holding on his greatswords hilt with one hand and looked warily at the youth with a darkened expression , while the old man looked at him with a thoughtful face . <p> Makarov was certain that Brendel understood part of the situation by now , although he did not think that the latter knew of their identities , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by him . <p> " Mister Brendel , Eke is the son of my close friend . I promised him that I would take care of Eke , but I accidentally got separated from him . Please tell me where you saw him . " Makarov coughed again and asked . <p> You got separated with not only Eke but the entire Grey Wolves Mercenaries right ? You do n't  even looked concerned with their well being , you piece of shit . <p> " Close friend ? The subordinate of Duke Rhun , Makarov , calling his lord with that title ? Would your duke agree to that ? " <p> The moment Brendel mentioned Duke Rhun , the followers behind Makarov immediately drew out their weapons , while he looked at them in amusement . <p> " Young man , who exactly are you . " Makarov finally cast off his friendly tone and questioned him in a demanding tone . He immediately wondered if Brendel was on Conrads side , but when he looked at the Acolyte of Earth , that did not seem likely . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who would be interested in this affair ? It does feel more likely that its not a faction within the kingdom . Then from the outside ? Madara or Kirrlutz ? <p> Brendel did not know what Makarov was thinking , but he waited for the old man to make his move . If he was standing beside Buga and Makarov , then his status would be high enough for him to do so . That was not Duke Rhun , and he would not make a mistake in recognizing that famous person and would not be fooled even if Duke Rhun was to disguise himself . <p> The old finally spoke , but the question he asked surprised everyone . <p> " Young man , is that the Fairys Apple beside your feet ? " The old man had spend all the time identifying it and asked . <p> Crap ! <p> Brendel yelled in his mind and realized he did not keep the fruit in his bag . That mistake was partially caused by Rauzes remarks on adding something to the Golden Apple , and also because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allies . <p> At the same time , he finally recognized who the old man was when he spoke . <p> That was the head of the court wizards , the old minister who aided King Ansen the seventh , Fleetwood Deverra Gemmer . <p> This person is the princess and princes teacher . So he s involved in all of this . To think Makarov has this hidden card . No wonder he s confident enough to leave Eke in town . He even fooled me into thinking his forces were stretched thin . Conrad must have sent part of his men to the town as well , and if Fleetwood is there I see . The Grey Wolves Mercenaries was a bait all along . Makarov wanted to make sure that all of Conrads men are accounted for . Then <p> Brendels mind worked furiously as he looked suspiciously at the men in front of him and his hand subconsciously touched his swords hilt . <p> Even though he understood the motives of the nobles need for such merciless behavior in times where Madara was at their doorstep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Scarlett and even Redi , had given up great sacrifices in order to work for Makarov , but were regarded as nothing more than mere pawns . <p> When they did not need these pawns anymore , they simply sent them out to die and destroyed their dreams , not even allowing them to resist . The worst thing was how they did not realize this point at all . <p> Brendel took a deep breath and gritted his teeth . He was determined to teach these vermins a lesson . It was not because he was honorable , but because he could no longer tolerate his situation . He wanted them to pay for their actions . <p> " Grandmaster Fleetwood , right ? " <p> Brendel took the Golden Apple and shook it in front of them . <p> His actions made Makarov and Bugas expression change . They finally realized what Fleetwood meant by the Fairys Apple . That was the fruit of the Golden Tree . With that item , they had the ability to change everything . The dying kings body , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apple , everything would change . <p> Was this the chance that the Gods gave Aouine ? <p> Everyone in front of Brendel thought of that . <p> Regardless of whether it was the two-faced Makarov or Fleetwood who had seen countless events , had their breaths quickened . <p> " Young man , the thing in your hands is important to us . May I know if you 're willing to sell it to us ? We will fulfill your demands , regardless of whether it is money or power . " <p> Brendel felt two hands placed onto his shoulders , and a small voice in his ears : " Do you want to sell it ? I permit you to do that , mister Brendel . " <p> Brendel merely gave a big smile while looking at them like they were rotting pigswill . " You want it ? " <p> " Yes , " Makarov continued from Fleetwood with incredible charisma : " Mister Brendel , that item in your hand is incredibly important to us , to the point where it can change the fate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not buying this for ourselves . We are also willing to pay and abide for a fair transaction . As long as you quote a price , we will do our best to fulfill it . Money , power , girls , or even boys , anything that you desire we will grant it . " <p> Brendel chortled coldly : " Such bold claims , mister Makarov . What do you have to guarantee anything to say , or even let me trust you ? Just because the royal family is behind you ? You ask me what I want ? Very well , I do want to ask you two questions " <p> The three men in front of Brendel looked at each other in confusion . They did not understand his request , but if that was all , this chance could not be squandered , so Makarov nodded : " Go ahead and ask . " <p> " The first question . I 'm really curious and I do n't  understand your plan quite a bit . If you had Grandmaster Fleetwood , why do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even throw away the Grey Wolves Mercenaries here . " <p> Makarov and Buga did not expect this question at all and looked blankly at him , but it was Fleetwood who answered : " Young man , these fights are not what they seem at all on the surface . I do n't  know how much you know exactly , but we do n't  want to the world to know that the royal family has interfered in this matter " <p> He did not wish to reveal this information to a stranger , but Brendel had already recognized him , and the item in his hand was too important , so he lowered his status and explained for him . <p> " I see . " Brendel nodded . <p> " Then the second question . The fact that you came here , is it because you wanted to gather back the Grey Wolves Mercenaries ? " Brendel lowered his head with a smile , hiding away his sinister eyes : " You see , I accepted your men into my group " <p> Makarov and Fleetwood looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , you 're thinking too much Mr Brendel . We have no intention to come back for them at all . It was because Mister Eke insisted to find his companions and his betrothed . " <p> He felt a little awkward when he spoke about his betrothed . It was shameful that he allowed the only son of Duke Rhun to get engaged with someone under his watch . But he shook his head and continued his answer : <p> " The Grey Wolves Mercenaries are a thing of the past . It does n't  exist any longer , and for the men that you accepted , I thank you . " <p> As expected . Brendel was grinding his teeth . <p> He heard a clanking sound on the ground , and everyone turned to the source of the sound . They found a red-haired girl covered in blood and holding on to her wound on her cheat , standing blankly there . The spear in her hand had dropped onto the ground . <p> ME:Andromeda is not worth itat all . They messed up big time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bioware long ago . Now they have some youtuber ( insert some kind of insult ) as a designer who spouts ( insert another insult ) about wage gap and white male oppression and that its necessary to have a transgender main character in game soRIP . And also thanks for the chapter : D. <p> Seriously ? Damn . I could really feel the Tumblr presence increasing in bioware with DA:I but I thought it was just them pandering . A shame really , Dragon Age is one of my favourite fantasy RPG series . <p> For Honor is awful truly awful in some parts but pretty damn good in others . Combat is good but could have been far better . Chivalry and like two other games on pc I think , if I recall right are pretty damn good for melee weapon style combat or aka medieval style combat . For Honor is like what this one guy wrote a very intense rock paper scissors or the more proper correct title roshambo/Jon Ken Pon . MP is bad more or less cause 4on4 is small when 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of a yes and no thing . Basically ME 2 had a 8.8 user score , then got a 5.6 on ME 3 . Now that andromeda got 4.2 ( improved from 3.9 ) , it basically means that BW fans generally believe that the series did n't  improved and does not live up to expectations . <p> Also , I do n't  really go to metacritic for reviews . Its just a way for me to gauge public sentiments . <p> The game ai n't  bad BUT OH MY FUCKING HECK ! By satans tits do people look like shit ! Cut scenes are so bad its cringy . Animations are still not fixed up yet either . They fucked up huge by downgrading to a subpar shitty engine that goes by " frostbite " *gag* instead of sticking with unreal instead . Game has potential to look good but demands more then ME 2/3 but for less . ME 2/3 look way better on my pc then ME:A . I recommend that you get it and play the game when its no more then 40$ tops as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completly agree with your choice to get persona 5 , instead of ME:A. albeit the userscores are a bit skewed because the devs did their best to bash on their userbase the last couple of weeks , in addition to the bad news that came out bit by bit . ( about animations and such ) <p> what i want to say is , if the devs would have been more cooperative and if the bad news were released all at once , the userscore would not be so bad . but the game would still be pretty medicore , with not very good writing and lots of bugs or faults . however it would not be a 3.9 but maybe about a 6 or 7 . <p> Hey Silentwolfie any chance we can get a night button or something , sorry if I am seeming greedy but readying 3-5 chapters at a time with pure white back ground and black text hurts the eye something fierce . 
@@37042175 @6042175/ <h> The Amber Sword Volume 2 Chapter 99 <p> I was hoping to meet the disciples during the journey to the Lizardmen , but to think that you would really offer yourself on a silver platter to me . This service of offering your equipment and XP is exemplary . But that figure over there <p> He rubbed his forehead and then beckoned with his hand to that direction . <p> " Come out . " <p> Silence answered Brendel . <p> The mercenaries in front of him were puzzled because they did not see anyone there , and they turned back to look at Brendel and the Elven commander with confused eyes ; Brendel was slightly surprised to see nothing happening despite his invitation . <p> " Hmm ? You do n't  wish to come out ? " He sneered , and pointed with his thumb . " Oss ! " <p> He did not have any patience for hide-and-seek , and did not mind to use violent methods to bring his wretched enemies out . The air around him instantly went into a frenzy , seeming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent winds before it was released forward with a loud explosion . The blast of wind shot directly towards his targeted area and the trees that were in its path snapped and cracked one by one . A deafening thunder echoed throughout the vicinity as it exploded in a circular radius , and once the dust settled , a red-haired girl was revealed . <p> The powerful gale had torn the robes on her body , revealing red-black armor and a war-dress that reached to her knees . She wore a pair of boots fashioned out of layers of overlapping steel armor , and was similarly painted with red and black . She stood in a battle stance and guarded her body with a halberd , as though this action was enough to prevent the Wind Bullet from advancing any further . <p> There were clear tracks on the ground where the air current split in front of her and traveled into two directions where it pulled dirt over ten over meters before gradually stopping . <p> Powerful . <p> This was what Brendels group thought of the girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighter , so it also requires a Silver-ranked fighter to defend against it . But to withstand it without any damage and not even flinch .. A Gold-ranked fighter . <p> The Nightsong tiger rubbed his forehead admist the gasps of the mercenaries . He wondered if they actually came to the Era of Chaos . They kept encountering Gold-ranked fighters for the past few months and every one of them was young . Perhaps the capital or the most crowded cities would have such people appearing , but they were in the southern region and they even traveled to a rural place like this . What was going on in this era ? <p> After a moment of silence , the red-haired girl raised her head up and stared at Brendel without blinking . Her reddish-gold irises seemed to burn with the intention of battling . She straightened herself up and swung her halberd forward . A bright arc of electricity trailed behind the weapon , and at the same time , the trees in the direction of her weapon were lopped off and crashed down loudly onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is that all you have ? " <p> It really is her . Brendel sighed as he had completely forgot to factor a boss like this . The Bishop of Lightning , the Crimson Spectral Knight , Milford . Brendel stared at her unique halberd and immediately recognized her . He had forgotten about this character and her Spear of Lightning which had made numerous gamers vying for that weapon . It was unexpected because this Spectral Knight was already in this forest while she was only supposed to appear a few years later . <p> When the Card Resonance happened he had formed an answer , but until the girl was revealed he was not certain that he was right . <p> The Laws of Eversong . They turned out to be related to unyielding hearts . Their hearts yearned for the light but fell into Darkness , and the Song of Lament is sung over and over again . This region gave birth to two Spectral Knights and actually resonated with each other . Brendel took out the Eversong Card and glanced at it . Mother Marsha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an undefeated army like the Elves , and not because of this reason ! <p> Suddenly he jerked his head back at the red-haired girl , realizing that she was not a spirit yet . <p> But that appearance is definitely Milfords appearance . But what is up with the air around her ? She feels like there 's a complete transfusion of the Blood of Gods within her , not to mention the contradictory facts within the game . Milford is an incomplete bishop of the Tree Shepherds , and she also has a Spectral Knights form , but that 's definitely a real body . <p> " Scarlett ! Redi ! " A voice rang out beside him . <p> Brendel turned his head and saw it was Sanford who was brought back by the Mercenaries of Lopes . He then followed the shocked gaze and saw white hair somewhere behind the girl . He was hiding behind a bush , trying to shrink as much as possible into it . Was it not that arrogant little prick , Redi ? <p> Fuck . Its this pretentious bitch again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given a good lesson to him last night and at least became a little more humble , but he came to look for trouble again <p> Brendel narrowed his eyes as he wondered how he actually hooked up with the disciples . There was indeed a demonic boar beside him . <p> Hah ! So that 's how it is . <p> He could not help but laugh with contempt : " You defected to a new owner in a single night , and could n't wait to drive your former friends to their death . My , my , my , you really are quite hardworking to try and please the Tree Shepherds . " <p> The Grey Wolves Mercenaries were stunned <p> " Redi , y-you joined them ? " Some of them could not believe their ears but they are not idiots . If they thought about what happened earlier , everything made sense . There was one who had a bad temper and immediately yelled at him : " You fucking cuntface , I treated you like my brother ! " <p> " Redi , how could you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked : " Redi , what 's going on ? " <p> If glares could kill someone , Redi would have executed Brendel many times over and even eat his heart alive . He had wanted to hide behind in the back to allow the disciples to kill his companions and brothers . That way , he would not need to have such a guilty heart . <p> But that was quickly broken by Brendels attack , and he started to curse everyone in Brendels group <p> These fucking pointy-eared shit pieces of . Elves ? <p> He suddenly realized there were twenty Elves who were covered in full armor . <p> Where did these bastards come from ? Did the commander , no , that cunning fox , Makarov , place them here ? <p> He looked carefully everywhere , afraid that it was a trap . He soon calmed down as he realized Scarlett was here . She had become a full Gold-ranked fighter and with the numbers of high ranking disciples he had , the thirty odd Silver-ranked fighters guarding Brendel would not be able to win . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Elven warriors . These Elves were really crazy to act like heavy infantries . Their weak bodies were more suited to become rangers , archers or hunters . He smirked as he observed them , before he realized his former allies were staring at him with questioning gazes or hateful eyes . <p> He needed to explain himself . How could he allow himself to be branded as a traitor ? <p> Redi relished that he had made this plan to drive the Grey Wolves Mercenaries to Brendels location . He wanted Brendel to guard these weakened mercenaries , while having an excuse to defend himself if the situation required it . <p> " No , everyone ! I did not join Commander Conrad . I merely made a deal with him to borrow his forces in order to deal with this bastard " <p> He pointed at Brendel : " This is the fucking son of a bitch who is the cause of all our trouble . " <p> " Me ? " Brendel pointed at himself and felt the situation was a little funny . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Redi roared at him , his old and new memories of hatred mixed together , causing his eyes to be bloodshot . " If its not because of you , I would n't end up like this . That fucking shit Makarov used us as baits in order to lure the attention of the disciples , just so that you can leave safely . It looks like the treatment for people are really different for some individuals . I think Makarov did not expect the final situation to turn out this way . " <p> He laughed manically : " Ser Brendel . You 're so amazing with your twelve Silver-ranked guards . I 'm really so terrified . What do you want do now ? Do you really think you still have the confidence and courage to teach me a lesson again ? " <p> Brendel was infuriated over the crazy narcissist in front of him . He wanted to speak but Redi raised his hand and interrupted him : " Theres no need to worm your way out of this . Commander Conrad has already told me everything . Why would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops just to attack you ? I 'm not an idiot as well . " <p> He took a pause to emphasize his point . " You are the real Eke , right ? " <p> Huuuh ? Im Eke ? Brendel felt like he was being turned into stone Fuck your right you imbecile ! <p> The author is forgetting his own rules . The ring takes 12 hours to get a full charge as an NPC ( or something crazy like that ) . He used the ring earlier to take out the initial demon At most he should have a half charge , which would n't be doing full damage like how he tried to word it . &gt;. &gt; 
@@37042178 @6042178/ <h> The Amber Sword Volume 2 Chapter 122 <p> Ill start off with the important news first . Next update is on April 1 , in case anyone is wondering ( I do n't  do April Fools jokes . ) . <p> I have pretty much spent the past ten days translating non-stop and I 'm going to have to seriously catch up with my art stuff now . For the next 11 days and the whole of April , I will expect myself to draw a number of fanart images and start exploring the options to either freelance or put up a portfolio so I can start applying for a job some time in May/June . <p> The next few regular updates for TAS would be restricted to 1 chapter at every weekend for the next 3-4 weeks so I can catch up with my planned art stuff . If there 's going to be any donations for TAS chapters during this time , I will probably need two days to clear it ( I 'll allocate 3 hours/day if there are any donations during this time period ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapters later on are still at sort of a cliffhanger mode , but I cant put in anymore regular time for this month . In my mind , I was hoping to kind of bring forward the regular updates so you guys would n't be stuck on the cliffhangers . Welp .. <p> Skip if you do n't  like to see how I edit things . <p> The recent chapters have three particular issues that I want to highlight as to why it took so long for me to do . This section contains spoilers for the chapters for chapter 119-121 in case you have n't read it for some reason . You can come back to read this section once you read them all ( the chapters have been posted ) . <p> 1 ) Level design . <p> Okay . Imagine you 're playing a RPG , you have a team consisting of Warrior , Archer , Wizard and Priest . Youre tasked to invade a castle . Ever wonder what the castle looks like ? Back in my art school , we were asked to imagine and design our levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to fill them up with things that are related to what they have . Could be flags , statues , weapons , food , etc . <p> The recent chapters of the Elven Ruins were pretty much barebones descriptions . Its kind of like how I imagine a client doing this for the first time would say , yeah , I think I want two outer walls surrounding that ritual hall which is the tallest building something . The ruins should have 1 main and rear entrance and 2 side entrances , yeah.- <p> This is the stuff I had to work with in the raws , and I think its the worst section thus far.2 ) Storyboarding <p> I also had some storyboarding taught ( just a little ) , but enough for me to have a headache when I try to piece them together to make it coherent . <p> So , Amandina is leading the mercenaries . She studied Infantry Tactics , okay sure . How is she going to lead the mercenaries in battle ? Is there some gesturing or shouting when she relays orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of goes back to that level design because maybe you cant hear what that girl is saying if she 's too high up and yet the description was , that building is the tallest Elven building in the ruins ( also not described how high it is ) . <p> Then does it mean that the hand gestures are universal ? Would the Mercenaries understand it ? We all know that Mercenaries of Lopes come from a different time period and are different from the Grey Wolves Mercenaries . All these details are missing . <p> In case you guys do n't  know what storyboarding is , imagine you 're the cameraman capturing scenes of people doing stuff . Like Group A mercenaries goes up to Position A on the ground , then asking Amandina about her decision . Then you direct the camera to Amandina at Position B. Cut to long shot scene of Amandina &gt; to close up of Amandinas face shouting from lower angle . You 're essentially capturing these few moments in a movie/television show and drawing them ( moments ) on a medium like paper or PC . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the levels of the boss wrong . Thats kind of a small mistake compared to the above two . That 's sort of minor and can be fixed easily . The above two problems , hmmnnnggg . <p> 4 ) Changes made to Chapter 119 121 <p> Ultimately the detail settings that I roughly made are , this building in the center I 'll just call it Goddess Temple to give it an identity . Its a building that is tall enough for people to communicate by shouting and see gestures ( it can still be the tallest building , sure ) . <p> Amandina conveys orders to Elementalists sisters and they signal out to the Mercenaries of Lopes who then relay commands to mercenaries by mouth . <p> Some other misc stuff in regards to overall plot that does not affect world settings . <p> This editing took me a whole day to figure out something plausible and the longest edit ( in terms of time ) by far , taking even more time than translating the chapters . Hopefully this does n't  need to happen again . <p> Chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hewjil left the battlefield , he received a report from the Lizardmen under Conrad and discovered that he had escaped much earlier . It cursed loudly in front of the Lizardmen , but was secretly delighted . If it was the first person to escape and leave Conrad behind , there would be repercussions from the Tree Shepherds . <p> If Hewjil did not discover the secrets of the Elven kings grave , it would not consider leaving its men behind . Telling the Tree Shepherds this secret would earn a great amount of goodwill and absolve his responsibility for leaving early . <p> As for Conrad who escaped like a coward , he would be treated as the scapegoat , while the Lizardmen would be seen as the ones who stayed behind to resist valiantly . The situation was unfortunate as the Silver Elves were ultimately drawn out from the graves by its actions , otherwise it would be free to complain to the Tree Shepherds about this bastard and land him into great trouble . <p> This bloody bunch of sharp ears bastards . <p> Hewjils uplifted mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All his stolen goods were placed in the ritual hall of the Elven temple . Giving them up like that made its teeth itchy . Suddenly , it knocked into its adjutant who was in front as it did not pay attention . <p> Hewjil did not have anything to vent its anger on , and this made it reach its boiling point : " You mindless bastard ! Do you have no eyes " <p> The leader of the Lizardmen suddenly realized something was wrong , it quickly snapped its head to the object that was obscuring the light in front of it . <p> There was a tall Silver Elf fully clad in a heavy-looking silver armor . A pair of silver eyes was behind a pointed helmet with two wings at its side , and at the tip of it was a long white tassel extending below his shoulders . <p> And he was riding on a white unicorn . <p> Behind him were rows of Elves also riding unicorns . They looked almost like they were carved out of the same image ; every one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They stood quietly there in the forest , while the forest was completely silent <p> The Elf in front of him looked down at Hewjil with expressionless eyes , yet they made it tremble . He spoke after a short moment , his voice gentle and low : " Hewjil , I presume ? " <p> The Lizardman opened its mouth and wanted to deny it , but it found that it could not do so because from the intense gaze that seemed to pierce through any falsehoods . <p> " Good . " The Elf nodded : " We intended to slowly find our way to you ever since the Lizardmen invaded the ruins , but it was only until recently that we were forced to come because the kings graves were disturbed . " <p> Hewjils eyes narrowed in terror and felt faint . These Silver Elves were not the same as the ones they fought earlier . <p> The Silver Elves had truly reappeared on this continent <p> =============== Brendels POV ============ <p> The card in Brendels hand turned grey after ten minutes passed . He threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing behind . The card had gone into the graveyard and he felt a little annoyed at that fact . Instead of reducing the number of cards inside his grave , it seemed like he needed to retrieve more of it . Knowing that the cards in his deck were limited made him feel even more frustrated . <p> He peered deeper into the silent forest . Ekman had a poor sense of smell , but it had strong vision and hearing senses . It was able to listen through all of its six limbs , and capable of capturing frequencies much more than a human could . <p> But the distance between them were nearly five kilometers apart . If he did not make any noise , the monster would probably have a difficult time finding him . <p> He considered for a while . Although he wanted to wait a little longer , he was afraid that it would turn around and go for Scarlett instead . If that was the case , that would be the end of her since she was unlikely to beat even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise his right hand and shot a Wind Bullet into the forest . <p> The ring is almost useless against that monster anyway . Using it to attract the enemy is using its capabilities well enough . <p> As expected , once the spell was released , sounds of trees being felled quickly could be heard . The monsters reaction was incredibly quick , almost rushing straight towards his directions . <p> Brendel did not feel tense at all . He took a deep breath to focus himself , took out a ruby from his pouch and counted the time in his mind . <p> Countless trees were being knocked down one after another in rapid succession , to the point where it sounded like an automatic gun being fired . <p> Three , two , one Here it comes . <p> Brendel immediately squeezed the ruby in between his fingers and formed an okay sign . He chanted the activation words and a red light was transmitted from it . The surroundings within ten meters of Brendel was instantly silenced . The rustling of leaves , the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Charge remaining : 6/10 <p> Brendel saw the indication in his eyes . <p> The Acolyte of Earth immediately stopped in confusion and looked everywhere . It realized that the faint heartbeat it heard earlier had completely disappeared . While it was hesitating on whether it should go back to the girl , it saw an elegant white deer appearing in front of him . <p> The deer trotted slowly across the ground silently . It was truly like an open challenge to Ekman who was in a berserk state . It uttered a guttural roar and charged towards it . However , the white deer was nothing more than an illusion which was made out of light . Brendel could make it as fast and agile as he pleased , and Ekman could not do anything other than to be toyed with . <p> Brendel hid on the branches of an old tree , holding on the statue and playing with the monster like it was a game .

With the addition of the ten minutes that the warhorse had given him , he gain a total of forty-five minutes . <p> The last option he had was the Unyielding talent , and Brendel believed that the Silver Elves would be done with the Lizardmen , even with the worst scenario where the Lizardmen attacked the backlines . Obviously , he would not gamble with his life if he did not have the means to delay the boss for that long . <p> The time passed by slowly <p> When Brendel wanted to cast the Silence Magic for the fourth time , his heart suddenly skipped a beat . That was because he discovered the monster had suddenly stopped moving and was not paying anymore attention to the white deer . <p> It was making repeated growls that Brendel recognized as a warning . <p> Someones coming , who is it ? Nalaethar ? <p> Countless thoughts passed through his mind , but he did not waste any time and recast the Silence spell again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did not look to the north but over to his direction . <p> What the actual fuck ? <p> His heart suddenly tightened . He went through his actions in his mind once , but he did not believe he made a mistake . <p> And then he caught something in the corner of his eyes <p> The bushes suddenly parted , presumably with a rustle , because the monster reacted by extending to its full height and roared . A familiar face emerged from the bushes , and the person was someone whom Brendel had seen before . <p> It was Eke Lantonrand Ophelon , the cause of this entire chain of events . <p> He was the only son of Duke Rhun , and the successor of the Lantonrand territory . But that was not the biggest problem . Eke was capable of seeing Brendel from his position while Ekman could not . <p> The first thing that Eke saw was certainly Ekmans body fully covered with the Element power that it had and he paled instantly . But when he looked around for a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> T This fucking wanker ! <p> Brendel wanted to strangle Eke for intruding into his plans . He truly did not foresee this person appearing in this desolate place . <p> Eke hesitated for a moment before he looked at the monster again . He pulled out his sword and ran further away from Brendel , while yelling at the monster : " What are you looking at , you monster , are you trying to pick a fight with me ? " <p> Hah ? <p> Brendel watched the baby-faced youth try to lure the monster away . He understood what his intentions were . At that moment all his thoughts were replaced by something else . <p> I have always been a fan of your translations .

I appreciate your dedication to appropriately translating a novel &amp; making it better ! <p> Always an extreme pleasure to see someone know that translating is more than literally making the word into what it directly translates into . Translating does n't  mean shit if the language its being translated into does n't  make any sense sadly alas too many are fucking dumb shits who do n't  realize such very important wisdom and common sense .

If you wish to support me , please donate generously so I can get a few more artbooks . <p> Chapter 125- The observer in the back ( 2 ) <p> The girl knelt beside the corpse that was almost like a small building . She flipped it around for quite some time but she did not seem to discover anything else , so she lifted the longbow by its string with her fingers , stood up and shook it in front of Brendel before placing it on the ground : " Do you want it ? " <p> " How about you ? " <p> Rauze naturally shook her head at the longbow which was taller than her . " Its useless to me , I just want to see what it had " <p> Brendel wanted to hit the ground . <p> If you do n't  need it stop messing with the body ! <p> He really wanted to destroy things with his bare hands so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Acolyte of Earth with one single blow for him so he had no rights to complain about it . He could only ask with the faintest of hope : <p> " Thats it ? " <p> " What do you mean by that 's it ? " <p> " You only discovered this longbow ? " <p> " Of course not , there are quite a number of things on it , but they do n't  fit my aesthetics so I did n't  want to touch them at all . " <p> This is a reason ? Brendel grumbled , but he continued to ask the question he did not receive an answer to : <p> " You still havent told me what you added to the Golden Apple . If that 's a thank you gift , I think I have the right to know what it is , right ? " He lifted up at the apple . He originally wanted to let Freya or Romaine eat it , but he found that it was fortunate that he did not do so . Only the Gods would know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further away from him , in case he somehow touched that interesting thing on it . <p> " Its a secret . " She giggled again . <p> " Secret " His mouth twitched a little . <p> Brendel still wanted to get an answer but Rauze suddenly frowned a little and looked to a certain direction . She put her index finger to her lips and made an action to get him to be quiet . <p> " Someones coming . " Her expressions turned solemn . " Mister Brendel , your adventures were really exciting and I like them very much . I came to see you personally this time because there 's a little trouble back in my clan . My friend and I need to return back there soon . " ( TL : Friends name is Phoral . ) <p> " Hold on . " Brendel suddenly caught on to a number of things . The girl seemed to have followed him for a long time , but he caught onto something that practically confirmed his suspicion : " Clan ? You are " <p> Rauze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mind . The only race that liked to call itself clan was the Dragon race . Everyone in the continent disliked them , even the Madara undead . They were arrogant and did crazy things , while being unreasonable all the time and were infamous for their deeds . <p> He really did not expect to be involved with a little girl dragon for so long , but it was fortunate that she did not become unhappy through the process and ate him for lunch . In fact , it seemed she seemed like she had a favorable opinion of him . Now he somehow felt a little lucky with a dragon covering his back . <p> Was this good karma for rescuing the refugees ? <p> " All right , Mister Brendel , those men are about to reach here . I do n't  want these lowly stupid creatures to see me . Do n't  worry , I 'll stay with you a little longer and not let them hurt you . " She stood up on her toes and petted his shoulders , like she was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming transparent and disappeared entirely . <p> Hurt me ? Why would Nalaethar and the Silver Elves need to do that ? <p> For the prideful Silver Elves to be called as lowly creatures by the dragon girl would likely cause their king to wake up from his grave and return to the world . At the same time , the dragons were the rare races who still held on the Golden Bloodlines . The dragons might not have large numbers because they conceived less compared to the other races , but any of their lineage had the ability to use the Element power from the time when they were born . It was the most recognizable sign of the Golden Bloodlines . <p> Nalaethar is really slow Hmm , did I forget something ? <p> A faint thought of something important passed through his mind , but he was instantly distracted by Ekmans body . Since a pair of unlucky hands already went through his body , then the items were probably set in stone . He first picked up the longbow in front of him and read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longbows string . He was barely satisfied with the stats . Even though it was merely at a Brass-rating with normal stats , the ability to create an Arrow of Petrification was very useful , as this type of arrow could not be replicated by spells . The arrow was completely effective on any Iron-rank fighters and below , but that would be a waste to use it on them . It would be a serious threat to peak Silver-rank fighters at level 40 , and even affect gold-rank fighters at lvl 41-50 . <p> The arrow itself can be kept like any other generated Magic arrows , and would retain its effectiveness even after a long time . This was something players loved to hoard , and many archers prepared this ammunition in advance . It also did not need special bows in order for it to be used too . <p> The Shale Longbow was not a terrible weapon but it was underwhelming if it was dropped from a level 65 boss with a perfect kill score . He eagerly went went over to Ekman , even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a boss was still something that enticed him enough for him to ignore other problems . <p> He carefully placed the Golden Apple on the ground . He did not feel like putting back into his bag until he figured what the apple had on it . Then he went over and checked Ekmans body . <p> He was a Planeswalker in this world and it was important to expand his Fire Element Mana Pool . This suddenly led him to consider finding and equipping equipment from the Elementalists profession . He could find brooches and earrings , and expanding his Mana pool several times would be an easy task . Even if he had shitty innate talent , he could be a qualified user with great artifacts . <p> Cheating with items in order to compensate for the lack of talent . Ha , ha , ha . <p> Brendel chucked away the necklace before he suddenly heard a snap behind him . When he turned around , he saw a group of men walking out from the bushes . Brendels eyes went wide when he saw them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Eke appeared , was it not possible that the bastards Makarov and Buga were nearby ? Naturally there were more than the two of them . Seven or eight men accompanied them , but they did not like they were from the Grey Wolves Mercenaries . <p> Brendel concentrated on his eyes on the old man behind Makarov and Buga , frowning as he felt like he had seen him before from somewhere . <p> But compared to Brendels surprise , Makarov and Buga were utterly shocked . They obviously recognized him , but Brendel looked like a hero depicted from some legendary fable . He was holding on to a short sword , with bloody wounds all over his fit body which were exposed to the air . The monstrous Acolyte of Earth , Ekman , was cut up with deep gashing wounds and laid dead with blood spewed everywhere . It was even dragged a sizable distance on the ground . <p> It did not seem wrong to say that the youth took the monster down all by himself after an incredible grueling fight . <p> Buga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even at that time the level 50 Boss was equivalent to a level 65 normal monster , which already exceeded a Gold-rank fighter , and were completely outmatched . The worst thing was how Buga and Ekman had the same Element type , making it easy for everyone to see the difference between their strength . Once he realized that he was outmatched , Buga and Makarov made the decision to leave the Grey Wolves Mercenaries and left them to fend for themselves . <p> The two of them took a step back when they saw that corpse . <p> This young man Makarov thought to himself . <p> " Its you ! " But it was Buga who spoke first . <p> " I was wonder who could it be . " Brendel answered lazily as he looked at them . He was laughing inside his mind . To think that karma happened so quickly . <p> It looks like you have yourself to blame for your bad luck . What a fucking joke . If I do n't  get my revenge , I wo n't live up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retire somewhere to live life peacefully . <p> His reply came with a pair of folded arms without any inflections to his voice . Bugas sudden call out was followed by a long silence <p> Is it Makarovs fault ? Brendel joined them know when they were reluctant to accept . And the chase after that was not by Makarov . Makarov only withdrawn from the fight . The one who guide the enemy toward them was Redi . <p> Brendel even leave them to die first after knowing the circumstance . The reason he got surrounded because he stuck completing quests to get items . He couldve broke out if he did n't  care about the loot <p> Makarov led the enemy to believe Brendel was Eke on purpose , or at least he did n't  clear up this point to his men . He then abandoned all his men because the Tree Shepherds were more powerful than he thought . Scumbag , really . I think half of Brendels anger comes from Makarovs betrayal to his men . <p> Brendels plans were supposed to be quite sound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just resummon them , but the Silver Elves did n't  follow his orders ( so did Amandina ) to clear up the Lizardmen and protect the rest of the mercenaries . <p> Then again who would have thought Eke was going to appear and pull off that crazy shit . <p> While its true that he could have gotten out early , I think that its a lot of good that he and his men fought such a desperate battle , cause there are more ahead . <p> Hello , and thank you for translating .

The monster-like commander of the Paper Cards and the dark bishop stood there quietly , as though they were digesting the information that Redit told them . <p> Conrad smiled as he looked at Redi as if he praising the latters cooperation . The truth he would find it praiseworthy , regardless of the latters brave resistance in order to die or his obedience towards him in order to live . <p> " Twelve guards with the Silver-ranked strength .

The Grey Wolves Mercenaries are done for , and those who are smart know when to go over to the other side . Do you want to join us ? " <p> Redi looked at him in with a dumbfounded expression . He did not understand what Conrad meant . The latter had guessed of his identity , and he was afraid that his noble status would actually harm him when he heard Conrad speak of it for the first time . <p> However , it was clear if he refused to join them , his ending would be the same as the useless cowards before him . <p> Redi was once again hesitant . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like a merchant who kept losing money . He poured in more investments in order to gain back capital , but it did not seem to be working at all no matter how much he wished for it . Conrad had given him a final rescue buoy .

I 'll lend you a few men , no , a whole squadron . I want you to lead them and chase that group of fifteen people . You do n't  need to kill them all , but if you managed to do so , I 'll give you the leadership of the Paper Cards . " <p> He slapped Redis face lightly : " Do n't  worry , I am not lying to you .

Now that he was offered a chance to live along with an enticing position , he started to feel glad that he had made the right choice . <p> Even though the Paper Cards were not as famous as the Grey Wolves Mercenaries , they were one of the biggest mercenary groups in the southern region . When he thought of the leadership position offered to him , he felt slightly inclined to become a leader . <p> When he finished reveling in that future , he suddenly caught a glimpse of a familiar figure shrouded in darkness . The dark bishop had stepped away to reveal a figure behind him , and Redi recognized her from the weapon . <p> " Scarlett .. ? " <p> " Oh , is her name Scarlett ?

With so many temptations before him , the greed that was hidden deep in his heart started to grow . <p> Conrad observed Redis expression and gave a subtle grin . He tossed the dagger back to the dark bishop .

He nodded his head respectfully and praised him : " You truly are a master at manipulating minds . " <p> He knew that Conrad had no real interest in asking the other Grey Wolves Mercenaries for information . Everything was done in order to show a performance for Redi simply because Conrad was certain about his weakness . <p> " Human nature is weak . We are keen on gaining profits and possess an instinct to avoid danger . But I do n't  toy with peoples hearts The only thing I offer to them is more choices . " He replied : " Sadly , compared to the people who speak of honor and justice , I have a flaw ; I can not lie like them . " <p> The dark bishop crackled : " But we humans are cunning , he did n't  show his weakness , did he . " <p> " That is why interrogation is an art .

The vivid-green foliage was surprising to their eyes , and the mercenaries started to wonder if the battles that happened allowed the trees to absorb nutrients from the bloodshed . <p> They whispered amongst themselves , but it did not escape the youths exceptional perception . <p> " Creating a myth like this is really scary . " Brendel muttered . He kept flipping the black card in his hand . Even though it was a legendary artifact , the baleful black color from the cards back was perplexing . Medissas smile was warm and pleasant so the contrast was striking . This was the only Black Elemental Card he had , and he had no other cards that provided Dark EP . <p> If he was able to summon the little girl , then he would be able to move freely without any worries . It seemed like it was still impossible to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was feeling the same sensations again from yesterdays night . The Card Resonance was happening again in his heart . <p> According to the rules of the Planeswalker , a Card Resonance means that there 's another card with the same series . I searched through all my cards but the Eversong card is the one causing a resonance . I did n't  think a card that I created myself would have something related to it . Does this mean that new Laws were written in relation to the card ? Or that its because of the Darkness Element that is causing the Card Resonance ? Or both ? <p> " Nightsong Tiger , is it possible for a Land Card to resonate with the Eversong Card ? " <p> " Its quite unlikely , my lord . It is very rare for a Land Card to resonate with any cards . The cards that resonate with Eversong could be equipment , creatures or barriers , or specific creatures that can be sealed into the same series . " ( TL : Medissa , Unicorn Night is Eversong I. If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will probably be Eversong II . ) <p> " The Card Resonance had happened six times since last night , and it gets closer each single time . The last time it happened was an hour ago , and I feel like its near to our left . " Brendel was puzzled . Was it a creature , or someone who was holding on to that card and moving about ? <p> He raised his head to peek at the location of the sun . They had been moving since last night without rest , and it was nearly noon . Most Iron-ranked or people with 3 Physique and higher , had no problems for not sleeping a night or two , but Romaine and Amandina were having a tough time . Brendel glanced at them to check their conditions . The Elementalist sisters took care of them which helped them to barely manage to keep up with the group . <p> There is n't much time left . Because of the delay in the Altar , we cant afford to waste even a second . <p> TL : About Redi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from . He sees Brendel as a merchant who offended the status quo in this world , i.e , merchant vs noble . When it came to Conrad , he s a Tree Shepherd who does n't  give a flying **** about social classes , so Redi is being a hypocritical noble here , as he probably perceives them as outliers who wield considerable power and can be worked with . <p> Remember that it was hinted that some of the nobles allowed the Madara undead to invade the southern region in order to wrestle power from the royal family , so that noble inside Redi probably accepted Conrads proposal more easily than he would think . I read criticism about Redi being that stereotypical Chinese trope of setting up as a villain against the protagonist , but I actually think he s quite subtle as a character since he probably reflects the typical Aouine noble heading to the fallen path ( at least that 's what I think the title of the chapter means ) . I think with a little bit more editing and handling on his character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love the part where Redi gave in to temptation . I love it when an author makes realistic characters , situations or decisions for his/her characters . Reminds me of Alice from Coiling Dragon who chose her family over Leylin . <p> I agree that Scarlet is probably the resonance , but yeah , could be the necklace Says equipment and/or creatures But Scarlet is a demon/undead ( ? ) now , so I think her . <p> As for Redi , I 'm ambivalent . He could be an interesting character if tweaked , but as is he s more just a cowardly brat . That said , as he considered Brendel am outsider anyway , and possibly an enemy , its not really a betrayal , but these guys effectively killed the family he s been with for years , that he would go over so quickly is I think not really believable . The way its made out now , he is just the villain of the week /arc . . And once Brendel gets Scarlet he s going to be the stereotypical scorned and jealous self proclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lol <p> Redy is just a coward who does n't  want to die . Being noble or whatever has nothing to do with it , those are just justification he gaves himself for his craven nature . Just a pebble in Brendels path to be kicked to the wayside . <p> Seriously ? ! I called Redi joining the enemy to kill Brendel ? Is the author taking story beats out of Writing for Dummies or something ? Hopefully he dies when he meets Brendel . He s not worthy of being a recurring villain . <p> I wonder if Scarlett will join Brendels harem or die making some sort of heroic sacrifice . If its the latter , then I really , truly hope that she does n't  die to save Redi . <p> I wonder if the card is that necklace she wanted him to retrieve . Though , if it is , then I 'd also have to wonder how it got turned into a card . <p> I think Redi is quite believable . He hates Brendel from the onset just because . Then , Brendel refuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . Still , he s a coward . He does n't  want to die . <p> Those two points his hatred of Brendel and his cowardice , are why he could be corrupted . Especially when you add the reasoning that he s a noble and thus worth more . <p> I love that the author added hesitation to what he s done . He does have a conscience and its not just about revenge , but also survival . Then he gets a carrot in the form of Scarlet . <p> Though , youd kinda expect him to be horrified about the stuff done to her and thus turn against them , but if it was n't love just lust , then I guess it works out . In a cliche Chinese novel sort of way . " Oh , I cant actually have her , but if I kill her and turn her into an undead and she serves me forever , its still okay " . Its a point of view I do n't  get , but I guess its because I do n't  really fall for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the resonance I 'm not sure its Scarlet . I do n't  see how she fits into the Eversong series , unless the Gods Blood has something to do with the ancient elves . Maybe its the same sort of darkness they fought against and what affected Medissa ? <p> Wimopy , I was thinking the same thing about how the resonance could be coming from Scarlet . The only thing I can compare with scarlet being in the Eversong series is her heart ( she and Medissa are similar in a way ) <p> I suspect the resonance is from either the necklace one or two from someone/animal with elven heritage who was corrupted like Medissa . I like the second one because it would be drawn to her card for companionship and resonate with where she now is . <p> Thank you for the chapter . Yeah Redi is just typical privieliged nobles son you could find anywhere , so technically he s no important character except for highlighting how far the nobility have fallen .

The boy was already about to be released from the petrification , and she hesitated whether to continue to petrify him or to go on a strike and stop . <p> " S .. Save me " The boys face was pale and his lips were dark , weakly mumbling and his whole body was shivering in a heap . It was evident he was in great pain even when he was unconscious . <p> Save you ? ! I need a huge budget to save you , and even after then there might be twouble from behind the scenes . This transaction can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider whether I can ensure my safety in this world . Sue yawned while supporting her chin . ( TL : Sue says Trouble with a lisp on purpose . ) <p> " Save me " <p> Hmm , who 's pulling my clothes ? ! <p> When she lowered her head to look at the unconscious- uhh , the boy actually woke up from the pain and was looking at her with wet puppy eyes . <p> Ack , staph it pwease , I 'm still a loli , I 'm not suitable to be seduced at this age <p> Sue had massive amount of perspiration forming up - If this brat continued to sleep she did not have too much pressure as to save or leave him to die . But now that he had woken up , she would feel guilty if she just watched him waste away to death ! <p> What was appropriate for this situation ? ! Sue spoke with mixed feelings : <p> " Erm , do you want to sleep for a while again ? ! " <p> " .. " <p> " .. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of awful quality ! <p> Perhaps it was hard for the boy to lose consciousness again after waking up from the pain He was a little more alert , and he pulled and gripped the corners of Sues clothes even tighter , with huge beads of cold sweat on his forehead : " Please save me ! " <p> The physique of the young boy was good . Even though the poison would have taken more than half his HP bar , he was able to wake up and jerk Sues clothes with a strong strength . <p> " Little boy , its not that older sis here do n't  wan na save you ! Its because I 'm lacking the herbs " Sue tried to explain : " Look , your own body condition is just terrible right now , if I 'm going to remove the poison by force your HP wont be able to support it . But if I do n't  remove the poison I can only handle the side effects I think the person who poisoned you is rich , and the stuff that the person used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Save me .. " <p> Reasoning was reasoning , but Sue forgot that children typically did not use reason . They were typically good at fawning and being shameless . They would not understand and could care less about the complicated logic behind the reasons <p> " Save me " <p> " " Sue swallowed a pint of manga blood that was surging up : " How about this , I 'll sing a lullaby for you and you can continue to sleep for a while . Urgh , you look like you disagree with this suggestion with your eyes , then how about a bedtime story ? ! Sleeping beauty , alright ? ! " <p> The little boy grabbed onto her sleeves with determination and would not let go : " Save me " <p> " Are you a telephone recorder ! " <p> Looks like I have to make a move , otherwise this guilt will torment me. and the key thing is , this kid is n't easy to lie to . <p> Sue silently drank her bitter anger , and took out a set of red potions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that your body is weak just drink one potion a little at a time . Be good ! Remove your hands , I 'll try and make a potion ! " <p> The bottles were laid in front of the boy , and the little girl finally regained her freedom . She quietly stood up and laid the crucible up and prepared to make the potion . <p> She could not determine the types of poison in the brat , and could only judge from the symptoms .. Persistent loss of blood , weakening , stats reduction but it seemed there was no speed reduction . <p> Tsk ! This is quality stuff with multiple combinations ! <p> The best way to cure the poison was obviously a holy potion , which could remove all status ailments . The problem was she did not have the herbs , so she could only try to remove the side effects , even if it was just one or two of them . <p> Moonstone , sanctified grass , black lotus , and other herbs She brought out the necessary ingredients , slicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy watched quietly as he discovered that she was trying to help him . <p> It was fortunate that he did not ask questions on what she was doing or where the ingredients came from , Sue hated satisfying the curiosity of other people . Some of the brats out there asked too many Why ? and But Why ? . And sometimes when there were questions that were too embarrassing or they could not answer , the feeling was enough to make anyone go crazy .. <p> Preview of Chapter 31 <p> After the white tiger finished his meal , he went around to check his territory , as well as to gossip with the bored magical beasts . He then went back to the safety zone . <p> This is where you do n't  get business . If it killed the kid fast , then his parents wont come looking for the cure and paying even more ! Double Kill ! ! Hehehe ! ! ! *rubs hands together while cackling evilly* . <p> maybe the person who wants the prince dead , doesn-t want it to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultra hightech poison that 's doesn-t immediatly kill him , but weakens him so hard that he will definetly die somewhere in the middle of the forest and eaten by magical beast . All people will go " Oh noes ! What the hell did he do in the forest ! " But no one will ask questioned about poison&gt; No corpse no Questions . Well , poor guy didn-t calculate the world travelling loli-parabola which could mess up his perfekt plan .

Ill probably get one more chapter done if its not too long . <p> Special mention and many thanks to beefcake who donated a whopping $150 . Most of it is going into TSTBGAM though . He/Shes like the first person who donated to that series ever lol , and the biggest donator to donate such a chunk of cash , so Ill throw in a few more TSTBGAM chapters just for you . Holy shit . <p> Chapter 94 Crystal <p> Brendel explained to the girls there was a requirement to summon or use the cards he had at hand , and expressed that he did not have the necessary materials to summon Medissa . Even though he had revealed part of his abilities as a Planeswalker , Amandina did not suspect the Mercenaries of Lopes to be summons . <p> Medissa is one thing , but the Mercenaries of Lopes act like people who are still alive . If people start to think that I can somehow trap people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gallows or to be cut down on sight . Fortunately , Amandina is loyal enough so she probably would n't reveal what I did here . I can probably spin a nice story somehow <p> After keeping the card , he directed the two mercenaries to scout the temple . At the same time a few of the mercenaries went to pass him the loot . The Spectral Knight had left behind a crystal and a pair of boots . <p> When Brendel saw the crystal he thought his eyes were deceiving him . He rubbed his eyes to make sure he was not dreaming . <p> No , I must be seeing it wrongly . Im called the Luckless King in the game , so how did I managed to get so lucky ? <p> When he fought the Golden Demonic Tree , it did not have any Golden Apple on it , and he did not find it strange because he simply possessed awful luck . He thought the crystal was a delusion , but after checking it various times and confirming on the Stats Window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crystal Boosting Equipment , Arm <p> +10% strength upon equipping . <p> Brendel pinched Romaines face , and the latter immediately furrowed her pair of delicate eyebrows in protest : " W-what are you doing Brendel ! <p> Even though he would ignore that level of protest , he really caused her pain this time . She started to complain loudly . <p> " No , I 'm just confirming if I 'm not dreaming . " Brendel spoke as though as he was sleep walking . <p> " Pinch your own cheeks , you idiot ! " Romaine was angry enough to lift her leatherskin shoes and kicked him . <p> This time Brendel knew that he was not dreaming because of the pain . <p> " Ow ! " <p> " You deserve it ! " <p> " I forbid you to wear leatherskin shoes . " <p> " Never ! " <p> Amandina shook her head when she saw the two were acting like children . The mercenaries were giggling in one corner as they knew their lord was in a good mood to act in that manner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really that important . <p> " Is that the Spectral Knights Crystal ? " She suddenly asked a question out of curiosity . The others were also waiting for Brendel to tell them what it was used for . <p> It had became a common thing for them to see Brendel as a walking dictionary . <p> " Yes , this is the Spectral Knights Crystal . " Brendel stopped his quarrel with Romaine and answered . Then he suddenly smiled " It looks like I got my prediction right , so Ill treat everyone at Ampere Seale for a day . " <p> Compared to how valuable the crystal was , the mercenaries were obviously more interested in hearing that line and everyone cheered loudly when they heard him . Even though they were summoned creatures , they still possessed emotions and their memories . <p> Amandina had visited the biggest free-trading harbor of Aouine during her childhood , but other than its busy nature , she did not have a deep impression of it . When she thought of his irresponsible actions , she started to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crystal really that important ? " She asked . <p> " Of course . " Brendel answered in a matter-of-fact tone . It had reached the price of three billion Tor coins even in the later parts of the game , which proved the value of this small Boosting Equipment . <p> These crystals were placed directly into the body , and there were three areas that a level 20 character can put them . The arms , the head and the torso . The price of it was even higher in the game because it was not an item that dropped upon death . While this advantage was lost in this world , it did not mean that it was any less valuable . <p> At least compared to the Thorn of Light , such crystals would never be lost or destroyed . <p> I have enough experience to upgrade Power Break and turn the burst of strength into 30 OZ , 10% of that is 3 OZ , and pretty much the equivalent of a level 20 legendary equipment . Once I get to over several hundred OZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that be ? <p> Brendel knew how much value it was able to bring him . <p> " If you want to put a tag on this , " He smiled as he brought the crystal up : " Three billion . " <p> Three billion ? ! <p> The mercenaries faces turned into incredulous expressions . If Brendel said three million , they might start to have difficulty in breathing . But three billion was more than the richest duchy could earn in a year . This astronomical figure was beyond the imagination of the mercenaries who were born as commoners . <p> They could only think that Brendel was joking with them . <p> Even Romaine snorted lightly and glared at him , while Amandina frowned and thought he was exaggerating again . <p> But Brendel ignored them and happily placed the object on his right hand , which gradually sank into it . He was used to the odd sensation , and he brought the legguards up once the process was over . Once he did so he exclaimed loudly . <p> Is this the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucky King ? A Spectral Knights Crystal with a Magic equipment . This is an Elite monster , not a Boss <p> He stared at it before he suddenly recalled something and asked in a hurry : " Who touched the corpse ! " <p> Touched the corpse ? <p> Everyone did not understand what he meant , and he realized he spoke wrongly . He coughed and changed his words : " I mean , who cleared up the battlefield and collected the loot . " <p> That question sounded a little strange . Was there a need to assign someone to do something like that ? The mercenaries looked at each other and was momentarily quiet , but a voice finally responded . <p> " It was me , my lord . Is there something you are dissatisfied with ? " <p> The voice sounded a little taciturn . Brendel turned his head and found that it was the older Elementalist sister . She raised his head up to him but she could not hide the sliver of anxiety in her eyes . He had asked with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Nothing , " Brendel nodded : " I 'll leave the matters of clearing the battlefield to you . " <p> " Me ? " She looked blankly at him with her hand placed over her chest . It looked like some kind of glorious task but she did not understand why she caught Brendels attention . She thought for a long time and could only think that it was some fetish of the nobles , and her eyes became suspicious of Brendel . <p> Brendel whirled around and did not explain to her . He was secretly delighted because he used to lead a bunch of luckless party members . This time there was a lucky person who was also a hot babe <p> The Blood Greaves were a standard Tank item in the game . Brendel wanted to let the Nightsong Tiger wear it , but the latter explained that summons were unable to benefit from any magic equipment . Even though they could use the sword and bow to do damage , they could not access the energy from the artifacts . <p> The only possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Planeswalkers system . By equipping a card onto them , they would be able to benefit from it . For example , if Brendel equipped the Holy Sword card onto the Mercenaries of Lopes , one of them could use the full benefits of the Holy Sword . <p> Although , the maintenance still had to be paid out . <p> The girls were not combatants so they were not suitable for the Blood Greaves . In the end , Brendel wore it with a little guilt in his heart . <p> If this is done in the game , everyone would have posted in the forums about my greedy actions to take all the loot . <p> True , but its still valuable knowledge to have . If he finds some kind of epic equipment that would be much better in the hands of one of his cards , it would be very helpful to convert it to a card at that time . 
@@37042192 @6042192/ <h> The Amber Sword Ch 9 <p> A lower ranked necromancer was well versed in two different magic , shadows and debilitating spells . <p> In the game , black magic was brought about the Miirna race . They were the servants of the twilight dragon , and had lived in the icy plains of northern Kirrlutz a century before the Era of Chaos . <p> The Miirna shamans were well versed in spirit and dark shamanic spells . These spells later on , along with all unnatural spells that affected the mind or attacked the body , were classified into black magic . <p> After the holy crusade , the King of Fire , Gatel , drove these citizens of darkness into the cold north , and it was said from then on no one ever saw them again . <p> But the Miirna definitely existed . In the Bible of Darkness , the black magic had been passed down to the Shadow Lords of Madara from these demonic race . <p> But to call the shadow spells as Black Magic was a little undeserving of the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in concealment , and the spells used were able to cover the tracks of a small squad of undead troops . <p> The skeleton soldiers were not invisible or vanished into thin air , but a mere trick to hide them under the dark shadows . <p> It definitely did not make their sounds , scents or other sensory senses other than sight disappear . It was also limited to a certain radius . <p> During the dark night , these spells naturally became the best cover for Madaras undead troops , and it was the main reason why Madaras army had chosen to only move during the night time in history . <p> As for the debilitating spells , Freya and the other militia had already experienced this frightening black magic at the Pine forest . <p> The evil assault spells were necromancers primary means of attacking , which relied on negative energy to invade the minds of the enemies . The stronger the negative energy from the enemies , the weaker their wills were , the more damage the spells would do . <p> Until the enemies deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black magic that relied on negative emotions to cause damage . <p> With such mysterious black magic at the necromancers fingertips , with its cunning and deceptive nature , leading skeleton soldiers that were stronger than the average human , it appeared as if the necromancer was an enemy that was exceedingly difficult to defeat . <p> But Sophie knew their secret . Necromancers did not have the ability to cast magic . Its true source of power came from the bone staffs in their hands . The bone staff was a powerful magic artifact that belonged to its own individual owner , and once it left their hands , it would become an ordinary stick . <p> With this knowledge at hand , Sophie prepared a strategy to defeat the necromancer . <p> Following the next defeated skeleton soldier under Sophies supervision , the strongest sword fighters , Freya and Irena marched towards the necromancer on both sides . <p> " Attack its hand ! The dark shamanic spells are not as mystical as you think , " Sophie pointed out the undying monsters weakness from behind : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and knock the bone staff out of his hand " <p> That necromancer abruptly raised its head and met Sophies eyes , the viridescent flames quivering in hatred . Sophie choked up , his throat drying up as though it was being burned . He knew that the necromancer was starting to focus on him , but he tried to shrug off the unnerving feeling quickly , as he knew it was impossible for the necromancer to bypass the militia and attack him . <p> Nevertheless , the terrifying chill from the creatures gaze forced him to halt his instructions , and he waited for Freya and Irene to rob its concentration away . <p> The necromancer gave a ghastly laugh and shook the bone staff . Darkness covered it completely as if it was being submerged by a wave of water . When Irenes long sword pierced into it , there was nothing but thin air . The necromancer had vanished at the very same spot . <p> " Huh ? " The girl was stunned . <p> Sophies expression did not change at all ; he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your left , Irene ! " <p> She did not react to his voice in time . <p> But Freya who rushed over slashed through the air with her sword , a straight silver line that seemed to illuminate the inky night , and when it reached the place where Sophie had directed , the necromancer stumbled backwards in dismay . <p> " Human ! ! ! Who are you ! You are not a militia at all ! " The screaming voice was of a frenzied rage , and its expression appeared to be in utter agitation . <p> It was impossible for a militia to know this much , and part of what Sophie said only circulated amongst the Madaras undead necromancers . <p> But Sophie kept his silence , and Freyas sword followed up again . The green lights in the necromancers eye sockets danced wildly , it raised the bone staff to parry the sword in hatred . <p> A necromancer possessed 1.7 OZ , and Freya did not have a higher strength than Brendel , thus her attack was easily steered to one side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to stop . She subsconsciously held against her left shoulder and grimaced . <p> The injury from the arrow earlier seemed to be reopened . <p> " Boss-neesama , let Mackie do it , your injury " Irene shouted out as she defended against the necromancer . <p> Mackie and little Fenix charged over to them . <p> " Little Fenix , I want you to back off ! " But Freya cut off his path and shouted at that inexperienced brat with a fierce command . <p> " But I 'm also a soldier ! " The adolescent shouted in defiance . <p> " Back off , did you hear what I said ! " <p> Little Fenixs flushed red with fury , but he did not dare to go against Freyas order . She had always been the leader amongst them , with a kind heart and resolution in her actions . Everyone was actually content with her as the leader . <p> Sophie shook his head in disapproval . The battlefield was not a place to have a squabble . But Freyas insistence had raised his favorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl like her back in his previous world . ( TL : Really ? Haha . ) <p> " The four of you attack the necromancer together . " He said simply . <p> " Mister Brendel , you ! " Freya was lost for words as she looked back involuntarily . The young Romaine stood beside the youth who was lying on the boulder . She looked at Freya innocently and blinked . <p> This damn girl , she defected already to his side already ? ! <p> Freya fumed inwardly . <p> " A necromancer is an enemy that is hard to deal with , and the four of you are just sufficient to cover each others back . " Sophie answered in a serious manner . <p> " But little Fenix " <p> " He s also one of the militia . " <p> Freya bit her lips . When she turned back to look , Mackie and Irene were steadily losing ground from the necromancers attack . If the undead creature found a chance to cast a spell , the squad would lose another member . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She nodded reluctantly as she thought through the possibility . <p> But Freya grabbed his cuff from behind and ordered him solemnly : " You are going to follow closely to me , and never go out of my sword arms radius . Do you understand ? " <p> " Oooh " He replied with disappointment . <p> The situation was reversed when both Freya and little Fenix joined the battle . Irene and her were outstanding sword fighters in their militia batch , and surprisingly little Fenix was not any weaker . He was decisive and accurate with a strong inclination to attack , and unlike Aouines military swordsmanship which pursued balance in both offense and defense , he seemed to resemble Kirrlutzs aggressive sword techniques . ( TL : Military batch Erm , my mind is failing me , is there any official term out there ? ) <p> Sophie gave a high evaluation to him . He thought to himself , when little Fenix reached Brendels age , he would probably be as good as him at using the sword . <p> Sophie mused over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow in the upcoming battles , he would have most likely became as brilliant as Freya . It was as if he was born to fight and his flexibility was even better compared to little Fenix . <p> Unfortunately , there was such a thing called fate , and there were no ifs in history . <p> The battle between the militia and the necromancer relied heavily on Sophies input . It was as though Sophie saw through every move of the necromancer , and even the smallest plan it had was pointed out . <p> What was the necromancer going to do ? <p> Why is the necromancer doing this ? <p> Was it preparing a spell ? <p> When should it be interrupted ? <p> The necromancer grew more and more appalled . The undead did not feel fear , but it could also be unsettled . At the very end it was screaming : " Who are you ! An undead shaman ! Or a black knight ! " <p> The uttered sentences were exchanged for Freyas unforgiving strike . The claw-like fingers that were gripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scream . The green fire in its sunken eye sockets dimmed like it was a candle flame in the winds . <p> " Wretched humans .. " <p> The battle finally ended with Mackies orthodox strike with his sword . The necromancer had tired considerably before the loss of its hands and bone staff , and it wailed in frustration as the bright sword pierced through its skull . <p> The Souls Fire exploded from its body . <p> It was the final counter attack from this creature , but Sophie had already warned them preemptively . Only Irene who was a little slow at evading had her right hand singed a little . <p> The final two skeleton soldiers that remained were destroyed by the rest of the militia , while Freya and the others fought against the necromancer . Only one of the militia got wounded from the skeleton soldiers , and the forest was finally restored to its former peace . The wind blew across the forest , causing the leaves to rustle gently . <p> Everyone stopped and looked at each other . Their faces were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a necromancer and four skeleton soldiers . <p> Mackies sword was the first fall onto the floor with a clang , and it set off a chain reaction . Everyone hugged each other together , shouting and yelling , and even some of them cried out loudly to vent their emotions . <p> To survive from such an ordeal made their feelings ran high . <p> But Sophie was unperturbed . He raised his head and saw three golden lights flew into his chest from the darkness . Nobody seemed to notice this , even Romaine who was beside him . <p> The merchant girl also seemed to be relieved . <p> Hmm , I 'm the only one who can see it ? Sophie felt a little puzzled . <p> He glanced at his surroundings once , and opened his character window at the same time without thinking . He did the same things like he did in The Amber Sword , opening his character window once a battle was over . <p> He noted the change from his strength and physique . This meant he received the increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rating increased by 2.5 . The Ring of the Wind Empress granted a 1.0 increase in agility , and the rest of the increase came from his corresponding stats from his militia profession . <p> Finally in this battle , he gained 4 XP from four skeleton soldiers and one necromancer . It was half of what he should have received . Sophie thought for a while before concluding it was as a Team penalty . <p> This is total bullshit ! Why the heck would there be something like this in reality ? <p> But compared to the fact that he teleported to a parallel world was even more ridiculous . <p> He tried to think of this fact like a gaming otaku but he felt that it was pointless after a while , because this place was different from that online game The Amber Sword . <p> " Mother Marsha , its good that my suspension of disbelief is amazing .. " He rubbed his forehead as he felt a little headache . <p> Sophie stared at the Civilian soldier level and hesitated . He truthfully did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profession was pretty much garbage to him , and he had always viewed it a NPC only profession . <p> Now in this life here , he could not have thought that he would actually spend experience points on it . <p> And he even chose the talent point Unyielding ! <p> The gods above , there were just too many talents useful for a warrior , but this happened to the worst of them all . It was a skill that allowed him to be immune from fatal wounds , but he only had five minutes to bid his will , unless he received a heal powerful enough . <p> Except he still had not seen any restorative that was stronger than banadaging , and the potions that were in the game were literally everywhere . <p> Still , Sophie did not regret it too much as it did save his life . <p> The current situation repeated itself . He was unable to find another profession right now , yet he urgently needed more power , and the only solution was to continue walking down this damnable path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few moments . <p> A veteran warrior turning into a veteran militia ? Heck , was the warrior profession not enough of a cannon fodder already ? ! <p> The meaning is slightly off there . Imagine for example Playstation 3 and Playstation 4 . So we would say something like , oh playstation 4 is the current generation , while ps3 is the last generation console . <p> So right here I used militia batch , but what I meant was their generation of militia , and I cant think of a better way to describe it other than using " batch " . <p> I do n't  know if you 'll ever read this , but the word you 're looking for is either " muster " or " class " . The latter is used more often referring to a group which may have trained together , but did n't  stay together after training ; the former refers to a specific assembling of troops , which does not necessarily imply any training . <p> anyways besides that fault in logic , i feel like because the starting point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential to go higher than a regular soldier class , because most heros typically appear from the common civilians .

Two more chapters will come within 1 hour . <p> Chapter 102 Lure ( 1 ) <p> The difficulty of attaining a perfect rating for the quest was harder than Brendel imagined . He initially thought that he simply needed to protect what was left of the Grey Wolves Mercenaries , but it seemed like he needed to wipe out every single enemy that was in his path . <p> The reports from the Grey Wolves Mercenaries stated there are over a hundred Lizardmen Bandits , but the walkthrough states otherwise . <p> Lizardmen mob Over a thousand . Disciples of the Black Flames Over two hundred with the average strength of Iron-ranked fighters . Paper Cards Over seventy with the same average strength as the disciples .

There are TWO bishops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one currently with Conrad is the Dark Bishop who corrupted Scarlett .

The Silver Elves had already ended Redis life , while the Mercenaries of Lopes were helping the Grey Wolves Mercenaries with their injuries . Perhaps it was because of their similar professions , they seemed to bond well . <p> " What are you planning to do ?

" <p> Sanford hesitated for a moment but he gathered his courage and asked : " My lord , there 's no need to use such a complicated plan . I 'm sure these Lizardmen would not be able to fend us off if we strike at them . I 'm sure the result would be the same even if they are working with the disciples . As far as I know , even Aouine . " <p> He did not state the latter half . Even Aouine would not be able to gather twenty knights of the Holy Cathedral <p> While it was true that Aouine had more than twenty knights within the kingdom , the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any faction . But these words made it sound like he was questioning Brendels identity , so Sanford stopped himself from going any further . <p> Brendel still managed to understand what he was trying to say . He smiled : <p> " Perhaps you might be disappointed but these Elven allies are not under my command . They fight with us because we have the same goal . And one other thing , they get weaker the further they are away from their home . " <p> Sanford did not quite understand what Brendel meant by the Elves getting weaker , but he immediately spoke in a loud voice : <p> " My lord , you misunderstand me . We will never get disappointed . We swore an oath to follow you not because of you possessed a great army but to repay for your aid . Regardless of whether we are the former Grey Wolves Mercenaries or not , we will never break our oath . " But he quickly asked again : " Are the Elven allies Knights of the Holy Cathedral ? Do they still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. ? " <p> Brendel understood what he was thinking . Even if their strength was weakened by half , they could still be considered as people who had the peak strength of a Gold-ranked fighter . Twenty such Gold-ranked fighters would certainly be enough to annihilate the enemies in this region . <p> However , the rules did not apply in such a manner . A single stat reduction merely degraded their powers by a single rank , but in truth it was a level loss by over half . These Silver Elves were originally level sixty Elites , but Brendel judged that they would become lower than level thirty when it was time to meet the enemies in battle . <p> This meant the Silver Elves could not even maintain their Gold-ranked stats . That would spell trouble , especially with the threat of the Earth Bishop and Conrad . He needed to find other ways to defeat the Lizardmen . <p> But explaining these things required some effort , so he merely folded his arms and answered : " Do n't  worry and head off to convey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show you victory " <p> Sanfords reaction was delayed for a moment as he listened to Brendels words , before he nodded furiously . <p> The Elven commander watched Sanfords figure disappear in the woods , then glanced at Brendel and said : " I did not think you are this arrogant , human . " <p> " You mean confidence . " Brendel tilted his head slightly as he corrected him : " Remember , this is n't the battlefield of the Holy Saints , nor the era of your brilliant generals who are capable of commanding the battlefield to dwarf all other tactics . Perhaps the future might welcome that era again , but it would not be right now . " <p> Brendel paused as he looked to the north forest . <p> " At this point of time in this battlefield , I am certain that no one here has the capabilities to steal victory away from my hands . You can jot down my words , commander . I will lead them to victory . " <p> The Elven commander took a long time to respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you mean by the future might welcome that era again , do you mean to say that the Dragon of Darkness is going to return to this continent again ? " <p> " No , that is entirely another matter , I meant that there will be capable people emerging in the future . " <p> " How do you know of this , human ? Can you see the future ? " <p> Brendels voice was stuck in his throat . He hesitated for a while before replying : " Its not foresight but intuition . When the future comes I 'll return to this place and tell you what had happened in the world if you do n't  believe me " <p> Brendel did not know why he said all these words . Perhaps there were too many secrets in his heart which he kept away for too long . After all , the Elven commander was a spirit that could not leave this place . <p> The Elven commander looked at him for a while and gave an emotionless smile : " My name is Nalaethar. " 
@@37042199 @6042199/ <h> The Amber Sword Ch 6 <p> Sophie felt like he was in a long dream . He was in a place surrounded by silent shadows , and everything appeared to be distorted and strange . A black moon and a solitary high tower were reflected in a dark body of water . <p> What did the moon signify ? What did the high tower mean ? Or was all of this just a nightmare ? <p> Sophie did not know , just like he did not know when he would wake up . He persisted in this state until he overheard a conversation in his disconcerted state . <p> " Freya . " <p> " Briedon , have you contacted them ? " This was a girls voice , her diction was clear and distinct . <p> " No , there was a bunch of monsters blocking the road . We were not able to find where Sir Marden and the others went , and there 's this person " This voice belonged to a child . <p> The childs voice pointed towards Sophie . <p> Sophies heard skipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . It was like a pathway that connected him back to this world , making him feel like his body was gradually sinking before the youth realized it was gravity pulling him . <p> Sophie finally recognized the fact that he could sense his body , but it did not respond to him . <p> His breathing started to go into a slight disarray . Was he dead ? <p> " He s one of the wounded , take care of him . " The girl said . <p> One of the wounded ? <p> Were they talking about him ? <p> That 's right , he was gravely injured . His mind started to sharpen and his memories played back like scenes from an old movie . He had borrowed the body of a young man called Brendel , then bet on his life to accomplish something . That was certainly not something an otaku would do . <p> But he succeeded , thank Holy Mother Marsha . <p> " Freya , he s awake . " The child suddenly said . <p> " What ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not possible , he received grave injuries and Mackie said .. Eh ! ? " <p> Grave injuries ? <p> That was true . Brendels body was already in a fatal state , after which Sophie used the talent Unyielding and took another three sword stabs . He clearly remembered that his stomach and right chest were completely pierced through . <p> Sophies mind started to focus , and the surrounding voices became clearer . The noisy din of panicked confusion , with crackling sounds made from burning , along with footsteps and metal colliding that drowned out the conversation between the girl and the child . The temperature around him started to rise , as if to lick him with a gentle warmth , but soon after it started to scald him . <p> Hot . <p> He blinked . The first thing that came into his irides when he struggled to open his eyelids was a surprised girl . <p> Sophies impression of that girl who was supposedly called Freya , matched the one in his mind after listening to that voice . <p> She had light orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tied in a long ponytail , along with a face that brought about a refined heroic elegance . She- lowered her head to observe him and Sophie did the same thing . <p> She wore a greyish white leather set of leather armor that fit snugly to her , and inside the armor was a thick cotton shirt with the pretty emblem of black pine leaves on her left shoulder . <p> The militia of Bucce . <p> He also noticed the short sword in her hand , a medieval short rapier and the metal plate that was on the hand-guard was a flame signet . <p> The symbol of the Church of Flames . <p> He shifted his gaze upwards , and saw the bloody bandage across her left chest and shoulder . <p> She experienced a battle earlier ? <p> Sophies eyes captured every detail . <p> <p> Once he woke up , the noises in the surroundings died down quickly . <p> " Where .. is this place ? Where is Romaine *Cough* ! " <p> When Sophie spoke , he felt like molten steel was poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop of moisture . There was a throbbing pain from his chest that traveled throughout his entire body , and he started to cough lightly . <p> But what answered him was a wind coming from the mountainous stretch of pine trees . The wind that blew across the black pine needle leaves , making it turn into a faint rustle that was like the movement of a river . <p> No one answered . <p> " He woke up . " <p> " I cant believe this , he actually survived with those injuries . " <p> " He s probably just living on borrowed time " <p> Then the hushed whispers wormed their way into his ears . Sophie was a little confused . What was happening , these people should be Bucces militia right ? He was saved by them ? <p> Then where is that merchant girl ? <p> The plan succeeded , Captain Marden understood his intentions ? <p> He turned his head sideways . He first saw a bright bonfire which danced in his eyes , the fire embers following the rising smoke and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The girl finally came to her senses , and quickly rushed to stop him : " Wait , do n't  move , this is Bucce , do you remember ? " <p> " Bucce .. Bucce . " Sophie repeated this name . <p> " Can you tell me what happened to me ? " He let out a sigh . Logically he should have died , no matter how you look at it from the experience in real life or a game . <p> The only possibility was Miss Romaine who really found a health potion . <p> " Little Fenris and Mackie found both of you in the forest not far from here . " Freya looked at him curiously . Even though this youth called Brendel came to their village for almost a year , but he did not really interact with the villages young adults . <p> He was always alone in his gloomy house , and only occasionally accompanied Romaine to the nearby town . Even the dumbest people in the nearby region knew this youth was interested in the girl who dreamt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Freya gave another round of appraisal to him when she thought about this , along with a drop of suspicion . <p> " All of you are ? " <p> " I really wonder how you and Romaine escaped from here . " The girl gave an unwilling sigh . <p> " How is she ? " <p> " Shes very well . Do n't  worry , she 's better than you at least ten thousand times . You should pay more attention to your own condition , " Freya stroked her forehead , and spoke softly : " But she kept going on about going into the village , do you know anything about that ? " <p> Sophie paused . <p> That meant he did not use a health potion , then how did his injuries ? <p> Almost like an instinctive response , he opened his stats display , and the dark green data appeared in his retina . He stared at it in shock at the words : <p> Impossible ! Sophies first reaction was he was dreaming . No one understood his condition better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with massive hemorrhaging . No matter how he sliced , he was deader than dead . <p> Why was there 10% HP left ? <p> Sophie shook his head in an effort to clear his mind a little , but he saw the girls face beside him turned tense : " Do n't  move , you 're heavily injured " <p> " Do n't  worry . " He waved his hand subconsciously . <p> Sophie was very clear about his current status . Even though he was puzzled over it , he was not in a condition where he was losing blood , and there was no other bad status on him. - Although he was in a Weakened , and Near death , he understood these conditions would not be able to be solved easily and could only recuperate slowly . <p> But since his injuries are in a stable condition , there was no danger to his life . <p> This was the part he was most puzzled over , how did his wounds automatically became stable ? The talent Unyielding did not have this ability ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never seen someone who did not want his life . <p> In the beginning everyone thought this guy was doomed to die , and did not expect him to even wake up . Yet he woke up . Just from that alone , he should probably thank Mother Marshas mercy right ? <p> But this damnable bastard did not seem to care at all . One should cherish his life properly , damn it ! <p> " Go and lie back down right now ! " The girl drew a deep breath and ordered through gritted teeth . <p> Sophie became dumbfounded for a while , and could not resist to look at her . What was wrong with this girls head ? <p> " Y-you received the Militias training right ? My name is Freya , Bucces third platoons leader . Right now I 'm ordering you to follow my orders , temporarily , " Freya blushed , as she noticed she made a mistake : " You have no problems right ? " <p> " Youre Freya ? " Sophie became shocked and blurted : " Freya Elisson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father the great knight Ivanton ? " <p> " Huh , how did you ? " The girl got confused with the series of questions : " N , no , my father is only a carpenter in the town " <p> There was suddenly a riot of laughter in the surroundings . <p> " Freya , this guys pick-up skills are good . " <p> " You need to be careful , captain . " <p> " Nobody will treat you as dumb if you spoke two sentences less , Mackie , Ike ! " Freya turned her back and glared at them sullenly . <p> During this time Sophie took the time to observe the militia solemnly . This platoon had seven or eight people , which coincided with Aouines unit structure , but the leader was actually a female and that 's even a young brat in it . <p> He felt disappointed as he watched the girl and child . It might look like it was a special exception , but the truth was Aouines frequent battles over the years had weakened it beyond words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vitality the kingdom had from its shiny surface . <p> Sophie gave a sorrowful sigh filled with lament . <p> He witnessed this passage of history from the beginning , and did not expect to relive it once more in this world . <p> But perhaps he could change something this time round . <p> He stared at the girl next to him in a trance . <p> There was no mistake about it . Freya Elisson . The last general of Aouine , and later called the kingdoms War Goddess . She was the daughter of Ivanton , The Sceptor of Fire . She was not noticed early during the beginning of the war , but received the princess regents favor to become one of the top rising heroes of this kingdom . <p> He did not expect her to experience this battle too . <p> Unfortunately , now was not the time for her to hold the initiative . Sophie understood he had to be responsible for his own life , and also needed to be responsible for the lives in front of him . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head around , and looked back blankly when she saw his gaze . <p> He was not admiring or enamored with her , but treating her like a strange animal and observing her . <p> But why was he looking like her like that ? <p> " You have never seen a dead person yet right ? " Sophie suddenly asked . <p> " Hah ? " <p> " What I am saying is , are you afraid of people dying ? " <p> " No , I 'm just . " The girl paused for a while , at a loss for words . <p> " Then the injuries that I received had nothing to do with you either , can I sit up ? " Sophie asked earnestly . <p> " N , no . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> Freya did not know what to say . She was indeed scared . She was afraid to see someone die in front of her . Even if she was the future War Goddess covered with countless auras , the current Freya was a naive village girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , and still retained a naive outlook towards the world . <p> Sophie smiled . He too had not seen a dead person , but his experiences in the The Amber Sword were many times more than Freya . <p> He had at least experienced the pain of loss . <p> With the cogs turning in his mind , where his memories and events that tormented him played back one by one , he quickly matured and learned to cherish things . <p> But they also left the seeds of revenge in him . <p> " So I am saying , you 're just a country bumpkin lass right ? What authority do you have that would make me obey your orders , Miss Freya ? " <p> " You , you . " <p> Sophie knew that there was no merit to keep dragging this topic . He took another look at the bandages in front of his chest , and immediately changed the topic : " Did someone here tie my bandages ? " <p> " Captain was the one who did it , she 's the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The brat over at the sides rushed to answer first . He looked curiously at the young man . He appeared to be really experienced . <p> The militia in Bruglas was indeed different compared to their militia in a small place like this , he thought . <p> " I barely managed to stop the bleeding . Do n't  think of wandering around , I do n't  want to tie this for you one more time . " Freya immediately reminded him . <p> Sophie knew that the recovery effects from bandaging , besides from stopping the bleeding , was only effective a single time . <p> But he answered politely this time : <p> " Thank you . Although your skills suck just a little . " <p> " " <p> Mother Marsha above , Freya inhaled deeply . At this moment she suddenly had the urge to strangle this grinning bastard to death . What the hell was he trying to do ! <p> The following are a couple of changes possible . === === NOTE : Little Fenris or Little Fenix ? Starting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v2c58 , you have him as Felix . Fenris is part of Norse mythology , just as Freya is . Little Fenris would translate as Little Wolf . You might consider having a poll about this name as well . === === Sophie 's heard skipped a beat .

Now , it was impossible to buy something here in the magical forest . The most important issue was - There was no common currency ! <p> So how could she get a group to get the herbs easily and quickly ? ! <p> In the end Sue decided not to search for the herbs , and spent time gesturing with Blackie-bro in order to change her tactics .. <p> After half an hour later , the little herbivore guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but trembled even more than it was held hostage : <p> " Your parents , husband , children , grandchildren , great-grandchildren .. - Everyone of their ransom is 15 herbs or minerals .

For me to practice eviscerating ? ! <p> " To be a leader with passing grades , you only need to issue orders to the people who are below your ranking . If you do everything by yourself , that 's called irresponsible , or stupid . " Sue smiled and put the bag down , then went inside the treehouse . The little white tiger sprang into the girls lap and fawned on her .

Their battles against the Dragon of Darkness and the Miirna were the greatest they had ever faced . Their enemies had exceptional magic spells and combat techniques that made them gasp . They had never despised the servants of Darkness , simply because they were truly at the forefront of the worlds civilization . <p> They were so skilled that more than a few of the Silver Elves actually turned to the Darkness .

Did he come to this place by coincidence ? Or is it a high level successor to the Holy Cathedral of Fire and these knights are here to guard him ? ( TL : There was a small description in the past chapter about how the people who unsealed their Element powers needed to register in the Holy Cathedral of Fire .

She knew that she was not a match for anyone amongst the Elves , but even so , there was no intention of retreating in her eyes . Her body was placed slightly forward like a panther ready to pounce . <p> " Scarlett ? " Sanford knew of the girls movements . He and the other mercenaries were previously too focused on the Disciples , but now that they were gone they realized that it was someone they knew all too well . <p> " Scarlett , that bastard is a traitor !

He had seen enough in the game to recognize that the will of this Crimson Spectral Knight had not completely disappear . <p> Its her desire to protect Redi ! A bishop of the Tree Shepherds who does n't  care about life will never protect someone of their own volition , so this means she 's actually at her infancy of becoming one . <p> Brendel suddenly realized how she turned into a Spectral Knight and gave a thumbs up in his mind .

Unlike the other brutish Lizardmen , he had cleaned this hall like a civilized person , placed a red carpet in the center leading to a grand chair like how it was done centuries ago , with various stolen furniture that had different designs placed without any particular orde . Hewjil enjoyed the disorder and ordered his subordinates to stack these furniture up , of which he took time every day to study each piece . <p> When Conrad and the dark bishop entered the hall , the three of them snorted coldly at the same time . <p> Hewjil hated to even look at their face , while the other two men did not want to interact with a primitive creature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it looked like a garbage dump . <p> " Cunrat , you had died in the battle , I received news of that .

" <p> " I am going to remind you for the last time , my name is Conrad . " The mercenary commander did not have the mood to correct his bizarre Kirrlutz accent , and merely reminded that lizard not to roll the tongue to pronounce his name . <p> " The same to me .

" <p> The two men exchanged looks . It seemed like Hewjil was really doing proper work , but that particular matter was not of priority at the moment . Conrad arranged the thoughts in his mind and spoke : " That is not a problem . We require your help in another matter right now . " <p> " I helped you already . " Hewjil said unhappily . He spread the news of his group looting in the area in order to lure the Grey Wolves Mercenaries over to this location , but it had also attracted the attention of the nearby adventurers as well . <p> " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke in a low voice . <p> " What benefits ? " <p> " Something big enough . " Conrads expression was solemn . <p> ============ Brendel POV ================ <p> A loud thud could be heard . <p> Brendel had grabbed Redis white hair and smashed it onto the ground , causing the latter to scream out . The news gotten from Redi had made it clear to Brendel that the script had deviated from the walkthrough , even though that result was something that he did not hope for . <p> Conrad and the dark disciples have targeted me even before I reached the Lizardmen I should have predicted that this might be an outcome . Was this moron going to betray Makarov regardless , or did I change something ? The fact that he showed up with the Crimson Spectral Knight It does n't  really matter now . What is important is knowing Conrad had gone to Baerns ruins and has completely abandoned the idea of chasing Buga and Makarov . Instead he has turned his full attention to me . <p> Brendels fury was at its peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a grave situation and caused serious trouble . <p> " My lord , should we retreat ? " Amandina did not speak after listening to Redis description of what happened , and only spoke after a long while . <p> Brendel waved his hand . <p> They are going to pay a bitter price if they really want to cause trouble for me . Very well , it seems like its going to be a 100% completion route where I kill them all . Its not as if I have never completed 100% in similar quests before . I wonder what Mother Marsha would give me as a reward .. <p> Brendel quickly calmed down . He wanted to see how strong his enemies were and was imagining how he would cut them down one by one , but his thoughts was soon interrupted by Sanford . <p> " My lord , what about Scarlett ? " Sanford cautiously came over and asked quietly . <p> Brendel glanced at the unconscious girl . Several Silver Elves were standing beside her , waiting for the order to kill her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in Brendels mind . Putting aside what the new Grey Wolves Mercenaries would think , he would never agree to kill her . There was a connection between her and the Eversong card , if her fate could not be turned her next best result would be something like how Medissa turned out to be . <p> Based on Redis description on that strange figure , it should be that bishop mentioned in the walkthrough . Since she is only turned recently , then there might be some hope . <p> Brendel was not inhumane enough to try and seal a living person as a card , and he was very willing to rescue this girl who had a fiery personality . Perhaps she might even be willing to his subordinate , with the strength of a Gold-ranked fighter . <p> " Bring her along . Shes your companion after all . Perhaps there 's still some way to save her . " He said without thinking much . <p> " She can be saved ? ! " Sanford was shocked and urgently asked . <p> " I will try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept his answer . He understood that Scarletts condition was somehow strange . <p> " How about this person ? " Amandina asked quietly with a little disgust when she looked at Redi . He was forced to taste the mud as he struggled to breathe . <p> With those words , he seemed to regain his strength and tried to raise his head up with effort . His face was mingled with soil and tears as he yelled with all his might : " You promised , as long I told you everything you would n't kill me " <p> " My words count . " Brendel nodded . <p> He patted his hands as he released Redi , then looked at the Silver Elf beside him : " Commander , I will have to trouble you to take over what I wanted to do originally . " ( TL : If you still do n't  get it , its game over for Redi . ) <p> this is the unfortunate truth beings like reidi are not dead til you cut there heads off and incinerate there entire being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe and you see it done with your own two eyes till then there is the chance that they still live by some way <p> Ohhh nooo wolfie has n't  responded after his promise , 3 chapters in a few hours . Something must have happened to him . The dark demons of video games must have taken his soul again , just after he finally escaped their grasp . We , the readers , must send him help . <p> : <p> Well I guess I should get back to gaming and maybe I 'll find his soul in the void .

I 'm planning to draw an image for TAS just like I did for TSTBGAM before moving on to other stuff . <p> When it comes to translating stuff , I like to vary them . TAS is actually a pretty serious series that can be emotional at times , and TSTBGAM balances it up with crude humor . If I actually had the time , I actually want to take on one more JP series , lol . <p> Ill also see if I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only have one account and I would rather have it on my art , but I now learned that you can have more than one without being faulted for . Thanks for your continued support , everyone . <p> Chapter 85 The story of fishes swimming in Chaos ( 7 ) <p> Brendel had been thinking of ways to break through the Tree Shepherds plans from the start . Makarov brought them along with the intention to attract the enemies to them , and also the very same plan that doomed the gamers in Brendels memory to be utterly wiped out . <p> Even though the plan to escape was delayed by the arrival of those two , we managed to escape the ambush . While that cunning fox used this plan to trick the enemies into thinking Eke is amongst us , I 'm sure he does n't  know there 's an Altar here . <p> Brendel believed that his own plans were superior to Makarovs plans , as he was confident in his own experiences that were forged along with other gamers who had spent a lifetime in the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the fishes swimming in it might not follow the currents . <p> The gamers who later explored the land found out bits of historical content from the Altar . The monks from the Holy Cathedral of Flames were the first to discover the temple approximately one hundred years ago from the first era of the game , but the records were mysteriously erased as if they never existed . <p> Amandina glanced at Brendels unfocused gaze into the valley , and looked at the direction at where he was looking at . She saw dense tree crowns but was unable to discover anything . She checked his expressions again , only to discover his solemn looks , and forced back her questions into her throat . <p> She had guessed for herself that Makarov had planned to use them as baits from the very beginning , and was quite furious over his actions . She subconsciously placed Duke Rhuns and the people associated with him into a list where they were not welcomed . <p> Brendel continued to lead them down into the valley . <p> There were two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . Brances and vines were constantly hacked away with their swords , and periodically cast dim light reflected from the stars into the groups eyes . <p> Brendel checked the Stats Window and paid 2 Wealth to keep the Card , Mercenaries of Lopes to keep them in the field . He currently had 10 Water EP and 150 Wealth . <p> He suddenly canceled the Stats Window and narrowed his eyes as he discovered the two scouts ahead of him had stopped . They looked at each other as they had discovered something in front of them , then turned their heads to Brendel . <p> " My lord , there 's something in front .. " <p> " What is it ? " The Nightsong Tiger was the one who responded with a strict voice . <p> The two scouts were the youngest within the group and had the least experience . He had the intention to train them , but did not expect their inexperience to embarrass him . He moved towards them with large strides as he spoke , almost like he had wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he was also stunned when he pushed the shrubberies away to get a better look . <p> It was an large open clearing that was about the size of three hundred meters wide , and in the center of it stood a temple that was covered with vines . <p> The Nighsong Tiger raised his head up subconsciously to study the entire temple ; he was almost able to imagine how the grand structure would look like under the sun . Even now , he could almost feel how glorious it looked like in the past under the dim light . <p> Brendel had also gone forward to look at the reason why they stopped . <p> It was a temple that had tall marble pillars shaped into an arch with intricate patterns carved onto it . It was nearly sixty feet tall and the overall design was certainly a temple to worship the Elven Goddess . <p> However , many of the Gods had already died and became star constellations , leaving behind only their Will and Laws that shaped this world . The temple had already lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection . <p> " Wow ! " Romaine exclaimed . <p> " This is " Amandina was also stunned . <p> " The holy temple of the Silver Elves . " Brendel said . <p> He had seen much of the grand designs in the game . The Elves and Dwarves cities took his breath away when he saw it for the first time . <p> " This building used to be the burial grounds for the Elven Royal Family . The humans had left them untouched throughout history because they treated them as sacred allies , starting from the timeline of the War of the Holy Saints when they defeated the Dragon of Darkness and continuing unto this day . " <p> " But why would the burial grounds for the royal family be turned into a temple ? " Amandina turned around and asked . <p> " The ancestral kings of the Silver Elves swore to protect their territory for all eternity . Their Elven Goddess had asked Mother Marsha to allow their souls to forever reside in this land . " <p> " A Nest of Heroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " But why did it get abandoned ? " <p> " History states it was due to wars , but in actual truth the Ancestral Kings did not wish to participate in wars between humans . The citizens of Aouine nearly angered Mother Marsha as well because of the civil wars , so the real truth was covereed up . " He cast a meaningful look at Romaine and Amandina : " You wo n't find this in any historical text . " <p> Both of the girls nodded without asking why , as Brendel would have answered This is recorded in the wizards historical records ! . <p> " This Altar might still work . " Brendels words stunned everyone . <p> " " " What ? " " " <p> " Calm down everyone , its just a possibility . " Brendel was certain that the chance to activate the Altar was one hundred percent . <p> According to the research done by the gamers , the creatures that dwell within can exist for thirty days , which is more than enough to finish the quest here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiger . Both of them were greatly excited of the possibility of the advantages that could have if it still worked . It was as if a treasure chest was in front of them , which could either contain treasures or was actually an empty box . <p> The Nightsong Tiger licked his lips before he asked Brendel in a low voice . " What are your orders , my lord ? " <p> Brendel turned around and looked at the mercenaries behind him , then pointed at two of them : " Two of you are Elementalists right ? " <p> " Yes , my lord . " They nodded at the same time . <p> " Do you have men who use the crossbow ? " <p> " Yes . " The Nightsong Tiger immediately picked two more mercenaries out : " Is two enough ? " <p> " Yes . " Brendel took a coiled rope out from his backpack . " Come , the four of you . We need to practice a bit of combat tactics . " <p> Amandina frowned : " Theres going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its just a Spectral Knight . " Brendel answered nonchalantly before he saw the Nightsong Tigers incredulous face . He looked at him in confusion and asked subconsciously " What 's wrong ? " <p> " M-my lord , did you said Just a Spectral Knight ? " The Nightsong Tiger asked with a bizzare look on his face . <p> Brendel coughed once . He suddenly realized that the Spectral Knight was a level thirty-five Elite Undead which was easily stronger than a Silver-ranked fighter . The gamers had even described the encounter as a mini boss . <p> Since then , however , the gamers had researched deeply into finding the weaknesses of the various Undead , and he was easily able to handle the spectral knights even with a lower level with tactical means . <p> Brendel consoled him : " Do n't  worry . The Spectral Knights have a specific weakness . As long as you listen to my commands properly , its not difficult to defeat them . " <p> The Nightsong Tiger looked at his lord , partly doubting his words but also trusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area immediately , and they would roared at Brendel with spittle . <p> Are you crazy ? Do you have goat shit for brains ? A Spectral Knight is one the most terrifying Undead you can encounter ! It can move swiftly in the forest like a horse undeterred in the plains , and kill someone without even making a sound ! Anyone below the Gold rank should run because it would have fucked us up to our deaths with their weapons ! <p> The Nightsong Tiger instantly shooed away a voice that crept into his mind . The twelve mercenaries they had here would be easily slaughtered by the enemy , and even if they had twice the numbers , they would also be done in . <p> However , the mercenaries were summoned by Brendel , so the Nightsong Tiger merely nodded . Amandina observed his fearless attitude and merely served to convince her that he was a loyal retainer .

" <p> The youth glanced at him and gave a smile , but he did not reply . <p> Batum looked at him in confusion , not knowing what Brendel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led them to carve out a blood road from the Madara undead army which him incredibly impressed , he felt that Brendel did not act like a proper noble from the interactions he had with him every day . <p> Despite the fact that the youth had said he would inherit a land , Batum did not truly believe in his words fully , feeling that nobles tend to exaggerate what they had . Still , he decided to follow him because he still believed in the youths capabilities . <p> But after witnessing the interactions between the elderly wizard and the youth , he firmly believed in him now . <p> This young knight must have a powerful background , one that is unique amongst the influential families . Normal nobles would not have anything to do with these wizards of high authority , and their lineage might not even need to lower themselves even before the king . <p> Batum scratched his head as he looked at Brendel who was in front . <p> The third morning , Brendel and his group finally reached Bruglas <p> Bruglas could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The city was built along the slopes of Grey Eagle Hills along the eastern side of the Pine River , and buildings were distributed on the upper and lower hills . <p> The city was surrounded by concentric white walls , with each wall higher than the first , and rural villagers sometimes called Bruglas as the White City . <p> Under a clear sky , travellers from Ankries and Dragos were able to see the shining rooftops decorating the streets lined along the hill . <p> It was certainly a breathtaking sight , and represented a prosperous civilization . <p> While it was not considered a large city , there were thirty-five thousand people tightly packed in it , and probably the most densely populated areas in the Grinoires area . <p> The city also had many facilities and workshop situated in the Black Pine Avenue , where constant carriages and mules carrying heavy goods passing by all the time . Travelers from other cities could be seen haggling from the merchants as well . <p> Freya and Romaine were greatly surprised by the tall walls and clean streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bustling area had surpassed what they had seen in Ankries and Fortress Riedon . Even Brendel was amazed by the grandeur of the city when he saw it in the first time in the game . <p> Everyone became excited when they passed through the streets , but Freya and Romaine quickly stopped before the jewelry shops . The shining and intricate things that Bruglas made were exceptional , and they quickly caught the girls attention . <p> Freya looked enviously at a crescent brooch , while Romaine was attracted to a silver casket . Brendel could not hold back his laughter when he saw them hugging the items tightly . <p> The youth gestured to Batum and both of them made their way quietly to the owner and asked the prices , and ultimately paid a few hundred Tor to purchase the items . Romaine easily accepted the gift with surprised delight with a happy gaze , while Freya lowered her head with a blush and thought for a long time before accepting it , then quietly thanked him . <p> Brendel was not surprised at Freyas struggle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Batum giving a thumbs up stealthily .

He actually looks fatter . <p> Little Fenix rubbed his eyes when he saw the three of them . <p> " Sister Boss , Brendel , Freya ! Heavens , I 'm not dreaming right !

Freya almost subconsciously scolded him when she saw the rowdy boy , but changed her words at the end . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyones still around , were fine , Sister Boss ! " Then he looked at Brendel with great admiration : " Brother Brendel , everyone knows about the news where you rescued the refugees out of Fortress Riedon . Some of them went to Dragos and then to Bruglas , so the stories about your exploits have spread around . Did you really fight along side with the super amazing Red Bronze Dragon , Leto ? " <p> " Red Bronze Dragon , Leto ? " Brendel was slightly surprised that Leto got a nickname like that , even though he had a part in it . <p> " Brat , what do you really know about amazing ? " Batum knew that these rumors were actually Brendels instructions amongst the refugees . He did not know why the youth did not want to take this glory , but he still wanted to interrupt Fenix . <p> " Of course I do . Isnt it super amazing that a single man leading a few hundred men was able to escape the undead siege comprised of tens of thousands of undead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Red Bronze Dragon , Leto , I have also heard that he s a veteran in the Novembers War , like captain Marden . Of course he s amazing ! Ah , right , who are you , mister ?

" Batum was confused . <p> " Of course I do . I think very few people in Bruglas do not know your name . There are rumors about the Red Beard Batum who makes the undead quiver in their boots everywhere in the street ! If you do n't  believe me , just ask the Ser Knights in the headquarters , even they know about you ! " <p> " Making the undead quiver in their boots , this description is n't bad at all . " Everyone loved praises , and Batum was no exception . But just when he laughed with pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just beside him . He quickly stashed away his laugh and snorted . " Hmph , a bunch of morons . " <p> Little Fenix was baffled by his response , but as a young teenager , he thought that many skilled people had odd temperaments and did not mind Batums reaction . He looked at Brendel and asked : " Brother Brendel , you must be an important member amongst the mercenaries since you 're so amazing right ? " <p> Brendel laughed and ruffled the kids hair while nodding . <p> " Tch , I knew it . All the other brats in the street do n't  believe what I told them about you . " <p> Freya listened to the talk in great perplexment . She looked at Brendel and called him a great liar in her heart , but once she thought about Brendels invincible charge against the numerous undead forces , she felt her heart racing and turned her head away . <p> Romaine merely smiled at one side , and no one knew what she was thinking . <p> While they conversed amongst themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruglas had already spread in the headquarters . The citizens in the city loved to watch events like this , so the street was quickly filled with people . There were even a few young men from the Silver Winged Cavalry that came out in twos and threes to look at the person who managed to fight their way out from Madaras undead . <p> The Silver Winged Cavalry was the formal troops of the White-mane army , and part of them had fought against the Madaras undead troops and they knew how difficult they could be . Most of them were unwillingly to believe these ridiculous rumors , but there were reports from both the refugees and the soldiers from Fortress Riedon that confirmed the rumors , and the commander of the Silver Winged Cavalry , Lord Xelnal , found there might be truth in the rumors . <p> There were still thousands of refugees nearby Bruglas that did not leave yet , although no one seemed to have seen the Red Bronze Dragon , Leto before . <p> The lower ranked and upper ranked officers saw things differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legendary figure , while the upper echelons wanted to know what was going on . <p> " Fenix , are these the mercenaries from Fortress Riedon ?

" <p> The expressions on the boys changed immediately . The striking red beard on Batum was too easy to recognize . <p> " Hehe , at least you 're not stupid . " Little Fenixs tail could be seen wagging furiously . He knew that Brendel was impressive , but he did not think he would be linked to legendary people in the rumors . Even though he had exaggerated some of the details and no one believed in him , he finally got revenge when he saw their shocked expressions . <p> While the boys were in admiration , Brendel felt the gazes of i 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cavalry . He was not surprised at that , and had instructed them the refugees to spread a different rumor in order to escape attention . He was still too weak and not suited to be placed within the tempest that was to come . <p> At first Batum was his main choice to be his shield , but he also needed someone familiar with Aouine , so Leto was the best choice . However , it seemed that the army was still unhappy and jealous over the events . <p> The game itself had troubling cases of jealousy and pride , not to mention reality itself <p> A previous commenter said Leto is actually Lord Obereck who was the spy .. when you think about it it does make sense since he is strangely close to Brendel . If it really is him I will laugh my butt off because he is receiving all that hate and jealousy . What he deserves for spying lol

TAS is actually getting harder to write because its more descriptive and more confusing recently , that 's one . I 'm now spending five hours and upwards for one chapter just for the first draft ( which you 're getting right now ) . <p> Another reason is because of that undisclosed thing I mentioned earlier , and it kind of affects my IRL plans for the future . Its serious enough for me to actually disclose Brendels name in advance , and I 'll say that 2017 might be a really strange year and I hope it wont affect TAS . <p> The third reason is because I have been playing games , duh .

" <p> Amandina praised as she walked across the hall . The only time she had the chance to see Brendel in action was during the time in the auction site in Bruglas . However , she was busy pulling Romaine to safety and did not witness Brendels skill in action . <p> Three different sets of footsteps resounded throughout the stony walls of the inns corridor , echoing towards the dim exit . The owner had carved out windows from the walls section , allowing the ambient lighting to cast a soft glow on the dark floors . <p> " Yes , but Brendel has always been impressive . " Romaine added with flushed pride . Her beaming smile allowed her eyes to narrow in a bewitching manner , and she turned back to look at Brendel . He flinched as he became wary of her brewing strange thoughts in her head again . <p> This worry was not misplaced . Romaine first impersonated a regional noble to investigate the market , then enlisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enter Chablis . It was a dangerous move because scribing a map without permission was a risk to be sent to the gallows . <p> Her actions were initially kept from Brendel but her words gave her away , otherwise he would still be kept in the dark . <p> Not only that , she faked identification papers I thought I looked down on Aouines laws , but here is someone who seems to flout the rules at every turn Wait , does she even know what laws there are ? Brendel rubbed his forehead . <p> Romaine was remarkably cautious in her actions , and was quite alike to a cunning politician who did not reveal their misdeeds in any way . Brendel accidentally found her counting her coins in the carriage , before he realized that she had earned a considerable amount of pocket money illegally . <p> In the end he severely lectured her for hours , with her nodding and agreeing in assent with sincerity , but only Mother Marsha would know how much she actually heeded his words . <p> " What are you thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing . " Romaine shook her head rapidly and hurriedly . <p> " Then why are you so tense when I asked you ? " Brendel sighed in exasperation , his doubts doubling . <p> " Did I look so tense ?

" The merchant girls eyebrows raised upwards , but she immediately blinked and asked : " Can I go out alone for a stroll ? " <p> " No . " Brendel said curtly . <p> He refused not because he was afraid of her driving the scenic town into a frenzy of chaos , but of another consideration . <p> The battle earlier had impressed everyone in the hall , and even Makarov admitted that he was competent enough . Once Brendels fiery warriors blood waned , he felt his mind regain its clarity . <p> It was a common thing for a group of adventurers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was easy for them to get into trouble during their travels , and it was more than necessary to rely on others for help . <p> While it was rare for the Mercenaries Oath to come into formal actuality , it was not uncommon for them to be invoked .

That Makarov and Bugas actions are too strange , and they definitely have a hidden agenda . <p> Brendel reflected on Bugas facial expressions . <p> He looked like he was suspicious of me . Is that really necessary to be so suspicious of a stranger ? <p> He was quite puzzled . He thought back on the situation that happened in the afternoon .

" <p> His thoughts shifted as recalled of another issue which might turned out to be a new problem for him . <p> " The Grey Wolves . " <p> " The Grey Wolves ? " <p> " What 's wrong ?

Makarov looks exactly like how he s described , but why is the name different ? " <p> Did history change ? While its a possibility that they changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records would have been a huge task , it would usually be rejected unless there 's a huge incident <p> Brendel suddenly looked up to the stony window to look at the faint skylight . <p> ======================== Makarovs POV ================= <p> " What do you think of him ?

He narrowed his eyes to look at the town below the hills inn . Man-made steps were carved in winding paths to lead up to the inn . <p> The Maned Wolf Makarov was renowned in the mercenaries circle for nearly seven years . He was famed for his bravery and unforgiving duels he had , almost as if he had no regard for his own life like a starving wolf .

But that young man reminds me of someone . " <p> " Who ? " <p> " Hah , a really stubborn bastard . But putting that aside , I do n't  think he s a spy for Paper Cards .

To be honest I forgot what 's in it , probably just a normal DVD without any goodies in it since I just chose the 50$ option . <p> Chapter 6 A natural Lord <p> A miracle had happened before the citizens eyes . <p> The cavalry who charged towards the youth were crumpled like a piece of paper . Each time the youth moved , swords would either break or bend backwards , and steel splinters flew all over the place . The force carried behind the youths sword @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew off from the impact . <p> One , two , three , the citizens behind Brendel whispered , until seven of the riders were dismounted forcefully . The remaining three riders were already frightened to the point where they held the reins tightly and did not advance any further . <p> Gaspard stared at Brendel as if he was a devil , while Markov and his guards were frightened to the point where they forgot what they were holding in his hands . The refugees broke past their lines and ran to Brendel . <p> " Who are you ? " Gaspard felt that the blood draining from his limbs . He had seen the captains in the White Manes squadrons training fights , and he felt they were elite fighters , but compared to the youth in front of him , they were amateurs . <p> Who exactly is this person ? ! <p> Brendel sheathed his sword and exhaled lightly . He used Power Break seven times , and he drained a fifth of his stamina , and he felt his hands were starting to go a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . Im Dunn . " Brendel pointed his sword at Gaspard and Markov . " Now , are all of you calm enough to listen to my words ? " <p> The two leaders exchanged looks . How could they not listen ? The riders who charged at him were not exactly amazing , but they were well trained and charged at their opponent with a horse . Even the soldiers of the White Mane army would avoid their direct attacks . <p> But he merely struck seven times with his sword , and each single blow knocked off a rider off his horse , and at the end of the fight he looked like he was not even tired , and even the captains under Luc Beson could not compare to him . <p> He looks like he s at least a intermediate Iron-ranked fighter , but he s so young Gaspard swallowed . The captains under Luc Beson were veterans who were thirty to forty years old . <p> " Very good . It looks like you 're ready to listen . " Brendel nodded at the tongue-tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I 'm taking back my words . I want all of you to block the road . I do n't  care how many undead comes here , your mission is to block them . " <p> " Ciel . " He continued speaking . <p> " Yes . " Ciel jumped down when he saw Brendel beckoning to him , and took out his pocket watch and passed it to him . <p> Brendel looked at the time . There was still a minute left to 4 PM , but Freya was still nowhere to be seen . After rubbing his forehead he raised his head up and said clearly : " All of you here are respected members of Fortress Riedons cavalry , helping out the refugees to gain time is a duty that you have . I am sure that none of you needs me to remind what you need to do , and will stand out with bravery to rush to the frontlines- " <p> " My lord , I am a merchant . " Markov did not dare to act smugly anymore and spoke carefully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're now under conscription . " <p> Markovs mouth moved up and down wordlessly . <p> " Of course , " Brendel looked at the riders who got up from the ground . " I will be here personally to oversee everyone of you . Anyone who wants to flee as a deserted soldier , you can come back over here and try my steel . Whether you want to test me or fight against these damned skeletons , choose one . " <p> The citizens behind him had already started to move out to the north . People were pushing each other and trampled onto hapless people who stumbled onto the ground . The crowd was in a frenzied chaos as shrieks , curses and wails continued to poured forth from them , as if they were painting a picture of the world ending . <p> Admist this chaotic scene , the only place of calmness stemmed from Brendel alone . <p> " The rest of you , grasp this opportunity and leave now . Do not waste this chance that the cavalry gets for you by risking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remaining people who did not move . He was not a messiah , but he did not want to see more lives thrown away . <p> But he did not expect the majority of them to stay behind . The people had seen the unfortunate victims trampled to death by the frightened crowd , and even if they got out they were not certain that they could flee from Madaras pursuit later on . They would rather place their hopes on Brendel , hoping that the incredible youth before them was able to lead them out . <p> There were many people with power in this world , but there were few who protected the weak . Brendels actions had left a deep impression to them , and the last sentence seemed to make them trust in him . <p> " Youre unwilling to leave ? " Brendel looked shocked , suddenly guessing the thoughts of the people before him . He scratched his head and turned around , and saw Ciel with a face full of admiration . Brendel blurted out . <p> " What now ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knights had eight virtues . Mercy was one of them . Every year in this era , there are many knights who swore to uphold the eight virtues in the Holy Cathedral of fire , but who amongst them are able to do something like this ? " <p> The young man continued to speak . " To let the weak depend on you is the charm of the strong . But my lord , how are we going to achieve this ? " <p> " I 'll think of something . Just let them stay . " He went to Markov and Gaspard . " Have you considered carefully ? " <p> " Definitely , yes , we will fight against the skeletons . " Markov nodded as hard as he could . <p> Gaspard said nothing , but ordered his men to gather . He had talked with Markov and agreed that they had better odds fighting against the skeletons . If they went against the youth they would be killed instantly , while they had a better chance to fight Madaras army . Furthermore , Brendel had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely he would help out in fighting the undead . <p> Gaspard was the leader of the cavalry , and was at least considered as a capable man who would submit when the time called for it . He was even better at doing it more naturally then Markov , since he had to watch himself in front of Luc Beson and Lord Esebar . In the end he still watched himself in front of the youth . <p> Brendel , on the other hand , admired his decisive personality to be flexible . He stood there waiting for the riders whose weapons he broke to change to short swords , and at least for the time being he did not have to consider that the men had no weapons . <p> The guards and riders faces were uneasy , with the exception of Gaspard . <p> These men might have been dominating bullies during the normal times , but they were no different from a common man when they faced the fearless undead . Once they thought they were going to face such a frightening existence in the legends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a long spear and stood beside Brendel , trembling like a leaf without saying anything , and it was apparent that even standing there was difficult for him . <p> The citizens behind them looked at Brendel and wondered why the youth did not escape . Because of the words Ciel used to address Brendel , they thought he was at least a knight of some title . Since they decided to follow Brendel , they did not dare to leave if he did not . <p> A prolonged silence between them happened . <p> Finally , the first skeleton soldier appeared from the other end of a burning street , with two more behind it . <p> Scouts . <p> Brendel immediately recognized them . They came over with the sounds of bones striking against the hard ground . Their speed were not too fast or slow . He checked the pocket watch again . If Freya still did not come , he would let Ciel and Romaine move ahead first , while he would go out to find her . He would still see her as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if he was disappointed at her results . <p> He put down the watch as he saw the skeletons approaching the guards . There were seven of them , and if they divide themselves into three groups , they would easily destroy the low level skeletons , but they actually crumpled right there onto the ground , not even able to turn and flee <p> The three skeletons killed the seven of them . <p> The eleven riders were so shocked and frightened they did not even have the courage to go up and fight back . Brendel was- dumbfounded and surprised at the outcome that he could not react in time to save the guards . For one moment , he wanted to just cut the useless riders in front of him and be done with it , before checking himself as he still needed more bodies to cut a path through Madaras army to save the citizens . <p> " What are you bunch of morons doing ? ! Where did your bravery go after bullying the citizens for so long ! " Brendel shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how its done . " <p> " Me ? " Gaspard might looked like he was calm , but his hands were turning into jelly . <p> Brendel said nothing more and just looked at him . <p> Gaspard clenched his teeth . He knew that he was most likely going to end up dead . He normally drank and feasted while sleeping with some wench during the normal times , and had already discarded his swordsmanship a long time ago . He glared at his subordinates , but they quickly averted their faces away and pretended not to meet his eyes . <p> " You bunch of bastards raised by prostitutes ! " The rider cursed out loudly as he charged forward with his long sword , half trembling . One against three , and the youth appeared as if he had not intention to fight . He closed his eyes as he galloped closer to the skeletons , almost certain that he was going to be dead . <p> But right at this moment , there were rumbling noises that felt like horses galloping . Gaspard was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was the sound of a vanguard cavalry charging together . The rumbling noises got louder , as if it was thunder that came from a distance away . The earth seemed to tremble , and the skeletons turned their heads around , noticing the oddity of Lifeforce gathered together . <p> Three horses suddenly jumped out from the burning flames , and sword flashes could be seen as the skeletons were struck down into pieces . The riders on them pulled the horses reins , and galloped towards Brendel before stopping a slight distance away from him <p> Brendel looked up and saw the figure of a person wearing sky blue armor , with one hand holding a sword , while the other hand pulling the reins . The long ponytail was illuminated by the flames in the street , and Brendel saw an elegant rider on top of a horse . <p> Behind her , more and more riders came out from the flames and gathered behind her , the majority of them wearing outfits that belonged to mercenaries . <p> The majority of them looks like they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few of them are at least intermediate ranks Brendel was surprised . <p> Where did this group of mercenaries come from ? There are at least ten over people here that are as good as Luc Besons captains ! Wait Could this be the private army of Freyas father ? Brendel knew of Freyas true birth , and took a wild guess . <p> " Brendel , wheres Romaine ? " Freya looked curiously at the people in front of her . <p> they did n't  grow in a place of conflict they are more like bad caps that see a robbery in process but claim that it is not robbery ( seems the worst bs ever but it happened to me and some friends sad country indeed ) <p> &gt;&gt;Do not waste this chance that the cavalry got for you with their risked lives . the ending of this sentence is strange both in tense and in phrasing : &gt; " will get for you by risking their lives " or &gt; " got for you with their lives "

Conrad and the Disciples of the Black Flamess bishop stood together to survey the battlefield strewn with corpses , as wafts of white smoke rose thickly . There was death everywhere . <p> Demons , disciples , mercenaries bodies were gradually becoming colder as their blood poured into the ground . They were still living a while ago , but their skin were becoming taut and their muscles rigid . <p> Conrad walked over a few steps , turned over a female mercenarys body and a groan could be heard from the latter . He frowned and ran his sword through her heart and ended her life . <p> He then raised his heart and said impatiently : " No , Duke Rhuns only son is n't here . That fucking bastard Makarov ! " <p> " Since you knew him so well , why did you fight this battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " We lost quite a few men , and it was that giant who was beside Makarov .

He pulled out the sword stained with blood and pointed to his nearby men : " Bring the rest of the prisoners to me ! " <p> Several shivering men from the Grey Wolves Mercenaries were quickly brought before him . They fought like the bravest warriors during battle , but once they were out of it they realized they had no chance to fight back . Their comrades-in-arms were skinned alive or eaten by the demons and they realized they had no chance to change their fates . <p> Once they understood this , fear of their unknown fate gripped their hearts . <p> Amongst them was the familiar white-haired youth that Brendel knew well . He looked condescendingly at the other frightened men who were pale . He had stayed behind to cover Yula and a few other Grey Wolves Mercenaries to allow them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught . <p> He glared defiantly at Conrad . He had once thought he was the commander of the Paper Cards mercenaries . <p> Bloody fucking hell That bastard Brendel was actually right . Not only was this shit bastard colluding with the Disciples of the Black flames , he was the dog of the Tree Shepherds . <p> Conrad did not look much older than Brendel , and Redi was furious over how Brendel had humiliated him . Now that Conrad did the same thing by catching him , he saw Brendel and Conrad as the same arrogant fucks who deserved to get their faces crushed by hammers . <p> He used the most condescending gaze he had to look at his enemies , trying to incite their anger . <p> If this piece of garbage intimidates me , I 'll be able to shame him and let these unworthy bastards know the bravery of the Grey Wolves Mercenaries . <p> He planned to do so , but Conrad merely paused and smiled at him . The latter then shifted his gaze and looked at another mercenary . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry and said muffled words because his mouth was gagged , trying to struggle and rush at Conrad , but the latters men restrained him tightly . He could only watch helplessly as Conrad walk over to the last man of the Grey Wolves Mercenaries on the right and said something to him . <p> That mercenary was momentarily stunned before he shook his head with much difficulty . <p> Redi thought that Conrad would have tortured him at least for a while , but that monster waved his hand and his comrade was taken away . Redi could not turn his head , but the sounds of flesh tearing apart could be heard behind him . It was as if flesh was being ripped apart from the bones while organs started slipping out from the body and dropped on the ground . Desperate shrieks of pain echoed throughout the forest , which gradually turned to sobbing howls and finally hoarse gasps with a final low bellow . <p> The voice disappeared after a while , and the remaining mercenaries trembled at the same time . <p> Conrad walked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared out of his wits and merely knelt on the ground and said nothing . The young commander shook his head with regret and signaled to the men behind the mercenary . They moved away , and Conrad suddenly stabbed through the mercenarys eye with his sword and kicked him backwards . <p> He clapped his hands and let his men take the corpse away . <p> There were three men left , including Redi . The white-haired young man saw that his fellow mercenaries seemed to lose their sanity because of fear . It seemed like they had started to remember they joined the profession because they simply wanted to live and not die from starvation . All the glory and belief that they got from their various feats in battle crumbled in an instant . <p> The two men realized they only wanted to live on . <p> Redi watched them act like cowards . They used to laugh in the face of danger and were proud of themselves , but their actions now made Redi curse at them in his heart , but he hurled muffled abuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cunt ! " Redi wanted nothing more to prove himself . Was it not just death ? He wanted to prove to his comrades who were controlled by fear that death was nothing to be afraid of . <p> The most shameful thing was to submit to the enemies . <p> Conrad seemed like he could not hear Redi . He dismissed the other mercenaries without even asking any questions . Before the final mercenary was dragged away , he managed to loosen his gag and kept begging for his life . He swore to join the Paper Cards and said that he was willing to tell everything that he knew , but in the end he was taken away . <p> Redi was the only one left . <p> Conrad stood right before him <p> Redi acted without thinking , and he tried repeatedly to pounce at him like a crazed animal . But his chest was immediately kicked hard backwards , and he looked like a kicked dog who rolled a few times on the ground . When he crawled back up , he realized that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to witness my bravery ? Who should I show now ? The enemy ? <p> He looked at the reticent Conrad and the bishop who had his features hidden in the shadows . They would not give appreciate his heroic actions . A bone piercing shiver permeated his whole body and Redi trembled . He thought of a problem . Was he going to die here like the cowards in a shitty death without reason or rhyme ? <p> I 'm the most talented youth aside from Eke in the mercenaries , if I die here just like the corpses here , who would know of my heroic deeds ? No , I cant die just like that , but there 's no one else in the forest to record them . Was there really no one hiding in the forest ? Someone who 's pretending to be dead ? <p> Redi did not want to die a meaningless death like the cowards before him , but he knew that it was a wishful thought for someone to record his honorable death . Before the Disciples of the Black Flames , no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He hesitated in his heart . Dying an ignoble death was something that he could not bear and his expressions kept changing . <p> Conrad looked coldly at him . He had said nothing from the start to him , then he suddenly pulled out a dagger from the bishops waist and approached the white-haired man . Redis straightened up subconsciously as he realized death was approaching . He did not expect Conrad to say nothing at all . He was from a long lineage of high nobles and descendant of the Knight Mark , and he struggled before feeling the cold dagger blade on his neck . <p> He did not want to die . <p> Redis heart finally had the color of despair in it . The will to fight back had disappeared , and Conrad did not miss the expression of his eyes . The knife was instantly withdrawn and his gag was loosened . <p> " Do you want to die ? " Conrad asked . <p> Redi opened and closed his mouth several times , wanting to curse at him , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . In the end he nodded once , before he suddenly realized what he was doing and shook his head repeatedly . He suddenly felt his face hot . It was not because of his own weakness , but because he was actually afraid till the point where he did not even listen to his question properly . <p> An utter disgrace . <p> " Then I 'll ask you a question . " Conrad straightened up to look down on the kneeling man : " The other group of men who traveled with you , where did they go and how many men did they have ? " <p> Redi was stunned . If the monster in front of him wanted him to reveal the core information about the Grey Wolves Mercenaries , he thought he would not be able to bring up anything , but to mention that particular group of men would mean getting revenge . At that moment , Redi saw them as people to cooperate with , and not surrendering to them . <p> I will first get revenge on that bastard . He gritted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you attacked . They are fifteen in total and their leader is around your age . Amongst them are twelve guards and two girls . " He paused for a moment : " The guards are at least Silver-ranks . I know this because I secretly listened to the commander and Buga talking . " <p> He spilled everything out without even Conrads reminder . If Brendel was to see this scene , he would have been laughing out loud from anger . He only punched him once while Conrad had kicked him like a dog , and it seemed like he had completely forgotten about that fact . <p> And yet again it is proven that if any little s**t gives you trouble and does n't  immediately learn his lesson after being smacked around a bit , you should kill him without mercy , and then you should probably just go ahead and kill everyone that knew him or had any tangential relationship to him , because in Chinese WN logic , anyone you do n't  kill is destined to screw you over at the first opportunity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just kill everyone in the world , because everyone is related to everyone else if you look deeply enough . <p> This chapter could have actually been marginally decent if he had just lied a bit instead of embracing his identity as a cliche so very very hard . Heck , it could even have been salvaged if his reason for betraying Brendel had simply been to buy time for his friends who managed to escape the battlefield . The only thing that could make this worse is if he willingly joined the Paper Cards in hunting Brendel down and made some stupid , self-righteous speech when they found him . <p> Huh ? how could he be a genius second only to eke in the merc when he got instant KO by iron rank summon while there 's also a silver rank girl that could use resonance ( which seems to be rare ) .

@@37042230 @6042230/ <h> The Amber Sword Volume 2 Chapter 90 <p> The Spectral Knight was not going to stick around till it was finally killed by the cowardly mercenaries . Brendel checked on the HP of the monster and quickly prepared ahead . Once it reached about ten percent of its health , it would retreat decisively , and he could not allow his prey to escape . <p> " My lord , that 's too dangerous . " The Nightsong Tiger looked blankly at Brendel for a second before he guessed what he was about to do and tried to stop him : " Let me do it for you . " <p> " You know what I 'm about to do ? " Brendels incredulous reply came . <p> " You can teach me , my lord , " He answered earnestly : " Were your loyal men , and you should leave this to us .

It was always up to him to clear up some form of mess in the past , but he had been worried about it every time he did so . Any mistakes here would not mean that he lost a level but death . The only safety line for him was the Unyielding talent , and as long as he protected his heart and head well , he could at least have a chance to survive , or at least write his final will . <p> The battle persisted for some time . The mercenaries used fortified crossbows that were banned , but most nobles closed an eye when it came to their usage . It was highly uncommon for most citizens because the people required at least 5 OZ in strength to use it properly , yet the damage done to the Spectral Knight was almost negligible . <p> In addition to that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only time where it truly took damage was when the bolts struck critical points of the armor , but the Spectral Knight was not a wooden doll that sat there quietly . Despite the loss in speed from the debilitating effects from the magic bolts , it was still agile enough to avoid most of the projectiles . <p> Brendel was not in a particular hurry . The Nightsong Tiger had enough magic bolts to make the Spectral Knight weakened for at least ten minutes . With that amount of time , a dozen Iron-ranked mercenaries would deal enough damage to a Boss-level creature for it to retreat , and the current enemy was only an Elite-level undead . <p> He slipped quietly behind its back while it was distracted by the mercenaries . The distance he took was neither far nor near , about half a soccer field . It was the perfect balance for him . If he was any closer , the undead creature might notice him , if he was any further , his accuracy might drop too much . <p> His goal was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spectral Knight , the damage done would not be effective to finish off the remaining 10% HP . <p> If I am already at a Silver-rank , if I already learned some form of bow-related skill , if I managed to land a critical hit , just maybe ( TL : Silver rank = Over level 31 ) <p> Brendels mind wandered a little as he explored the possibility of a backstab , but it was never going to work . <p> He glanced at the battlefield one more time before he concentrated on his task . The silence was deafening in this area compared to the battlefield . He parted the foliage and drew an Alchemy Magic Circle on the ground with his longsword . <p> Tamar would have persuaded Brendel not to do it if he saw what the youth was doing . After the Alchemy Magic Circle was drawn , he drew a Blood Magic Formation which was going to strip away his health . <p> He placed the rope onto the Magic Circle along with the Soul Crystal he took from the intermediate-ranking necromancer at Fortress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not going to be easy to get something like this again until many years later . There was no better replacement for it , otherwise he would not have wasted such a rare material . <p> He cut his finger with the longsword and dropped it onto the formation , and his heart tightened greatly . Brendel felt his vitality drain , and the Stats Window reported a loss of half of his health . Brendel had tried to prepare himself for it , but he still got a shock over how much health he lost . <p> He rubbed his forehead a little and was thankful that the Soul Crystal was not of a higher quality . If it was , he might have been sucked dry . But that notion suddenly made him remember that thing in his bag . He flipped it open and a golden light poured out from it . The light glowed and dimmed with rhythm , almost like it was an actual heart . ( TL : The Golden Demonic Trees fruit , The Golden Apple . In case anyone was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret that he had not told anyone . He was certain that there was someone who placed it in his bag . What he did not understand was who the person was .

Or to test me ? <p> Brendel felt unhappy when he thought about it . This thing was highly important to some people , but it was not of much use to him . He needed about four more levels to reach level 25 and allow him to activate the second talent , and this thing in his bag was not something he needed . After a few moments of pondering , he still did not arrive at any plausible answer and quickly returned to reality . <p> His biggest trouble was still the Spectral Knight , and any other matters could be solved later . <p> He focused on the transmuted object in the Magic Circle . The ordinary rope had turned completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . It looked quite impressive and he was reminded of a shiny new pair of handcuffs . <p> Brendel mocked himself for thinking of that . This was clearly a horrifying product of alchemy . It was merely a simple rope infused with the energy from a Soul Crystal . Because the quality of the Soul Crystal was so high , it actually turned out to look like this . <p> If Tamar was to see this He would come after me with his legendary scythe Wait , he has n't  reached the grandmaster status yet . <p> Brendel corrected himself as he stood up to watch the battlefield again . The Spectral Knight had managed to graze a few mercenaries when Brendel was not there to interrupt it . They were bleeding slightly , but in exchange they became even more cautious than before . Just like Brendel had predicted , the battle took close to ten minutes before the Spectral Knight finally retreated . <p> Its upper body creaked loudly as the armor was hindered by the ice . The Nightsong Tiger shot the final Bolt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice , but the speed at which it fled was beyond their belief . <p> The Charge skill . Brendel remarked to himself . <p> The Nightsong Tigers quick reactions allowed him to fire another Bolt of Wind , but the effect was not any better as it continued to speed away . The mercenaries wanted to pursue it , but the Nightsong Tiger stopped them . It was too dangerous for them to cross that invisible line . Once they did so , the undead monster was free to attack them directly without restrictions . <p> He was certain that his mysterious lord was planning something to stop it , and he simply cast his eyes into the forest . <p> Indeed , two dazzling bolts shot out one after another , causing two white lines to extend out in the dark forest Such was the sight before him . <p> Crossbows take a while to reload , and those bolts should have a rope attaching them to each other . If he fired one , loaded the second and fired it , then unless the rope was long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second bolt would be yanked after the first long before he had a chance to load it . And if it was that long , then either he s close enough to the trees to just stab the bolts in , or the rope will sag too much to do anything but lie on the ground . Well , unless the second tree is much further away from the first tree than the first tree is from him . Even then , there would be a significant delay between the two shots . 
@@37042232 @6042232/ <h> The Amber Sword Volume 2 Chapter 59 <p> TL : Schedule again is pretty tight for me , so its still 1 chapter per week , and if there 's a need to I might even have to put it at a TBD schedule . <p> This is my final 3+ months before I graduate , so I 'm going to put in a great deal of thought as to what kind of approach I want to have for my portfolio . <p> I believe TAS has a lot of potential for a portfolio . It has game elements , which is useful for UI design , - the cards based system also allows for some MTG/hearthstone drawings , and finally the characters allow for both illustrations and character designs . If I want to , I can even draw the battle landscape as environmental concept art , ie , Brendel vs Ebdon . <p> This allows for two ( major ) paths for me in the future . <p> a ) I become a freelancer &gt; draws illustrations/TAS web manga/manhua ( style not decided ) , or some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author if I do ) as a living . <p> I know there are a lot of people who want to see more chapters for this series , but it has to be on hold because this is my final chance to ask my lecturers for reviews on the stuff I do . <p> Chapter 59 The last night in Bruglas ( 1 ) <p> The start of Aouines final demise came about from civil wars . Oberg the seventh had gradually felt that he was becoming frail from his old age , and he was desperate to clear the path for the new kings ascension to the throne . In the end , he was unable to wait any longer and acted against the two southern duchies in the southern kingdom , which were his greatest threats . <p> Oberg the seventh had ascended to the throne only when he was thirty nine years old . This king who was fated to have a terrible demise had great ambition when he was young , and he was determined to his grandfather , King Ansen . That was the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cities , allowing central Aouine to become the strongest in its era . <p> Unfortunately , Oberg the seventh witnessed how the arrogant duke Arreck practically forced Oberg the sixth to change the militia laws , and that event had forever left a dark impression in his heart . Unlike King Ansen who ruled with both firmness and flexibility , as well as ruthlessness and clemency at the right moments , Oberg the seventh did not possess the skill to do so . In addition , the era during King Ansens rule was peaceful and without wars . The royal crown was able to control the military forces without any trouble , while the current era was fraught with constant wars . <p> The wind became stronger in Bruglass outskirts . It came from the direction of the sea , and the wind followed the northern mountainous region Karanjar to Randners mountainous region , bringing along the scent of the forest and rivers across its long journey , and finally entered everyones lungs . <p> Romaine was standing barefooted in the water as she held the hems of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel the wind on her face and neck . <p> " Brendel , the wind in this place feels like the exact same in Bucce ! " She took a deep breath and exclaimed excitedly . <p> Amandina also took a deep breath , but she immediately coughed . <p> Brendel glanced at her before looking up . The night wind was bringing a dense cloud from the west and it covered a huge area . It blocked the stars , as if to signify that the kingdom was facing a bleak future . <p> Brendel did not feel any burden on him , and instead felt excitement coursing through his nerves . The future civil chaos that was coming soon , was a chance for him with his meager strength to change a heavy and cold history that was seemingly carved onto a rock . <p> This dark cloud was not a manifestation of a delusion , but a signal for him to start moving . Brendel suddenly turned his head back , as if he had sniffed out a sign from the air , and his cheeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you get the money ? " <p> Roen did not understand why a simple news of the guards mistake sent Brendel into a short daze , and he felt that Brendel was becoming harder to read . He had witnessed Brendels strength when he fought against the Zombie Outlander . <p> That ability is n't normal at all . Now that I think about it , this man really is that old bastards descendant . <p> He looked at Brendel for a moment longer before answering in a convinced attitude . <p> " The money has been received , and I transferred the money to a safe place according to your instructions . " <p> " Did the people from the auction site pay any compensation ? " <p> Roen was startled , but he immediately nodded . <p> Brendel knew that the auction was ran by a famous noble . It was an open secret , and to these people having a good reputation was more important than money , thus he was not afraid that that there was going to be a loss . <p> " How much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counted with his fingers . <p> " Around two hundred and fifty thousand Tor . " <p> Brendel nodded and looked back at the rivers direction and found Romaine walking back to him with a pair of shoes in her hands . <p> He looked at Batum and Amandina next . <p> " Very well . With this our business with Bruglas should be concluded . " <p> Although there are a few other things that should be done Theres a mission within the nobles library that teaches some low level techniques , and the Star-crossed inns quest on the golden wine , increasing 1 OZ strength permanently If I attempt these quests , I 'll be using at least a month to get them , and that will delay things . <p> He wanted to pursue perfection and get every advantage here , but the change in Bruglas as well as the Unifying Guilds appearance made him realize that this place was not suitable to stay any longer . <p> Once these signs appeared , Brendel had made the decision with his fastest reaction and decided to leave as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We should go deep into Randners mountains or forest to seek the treasures there . <p> " Where should we go ? " Even though Batum kept grumbling about leaving this damned place , but he was a little uneasy when it was time to move . Even though he understood from Brendels suggestion that they could escape to Randners forest and mountains , they were still entering an untamed wilderness . <p> It was said that following the river or crossing over the forest after Randners mountains , was a desert that did not seem to end . The people living there described a story about a kingdom in the eastern desert : The famous Village of Pearls , the Kingdom of Nine Phoenix . <p> " Were going to split our forces into two . Batum , take Roen with you and return to the squadron , and let Leto bring everyone to a place called Gris . You need to hire a guide in order to reach there . At least for now , the safer road in Randners main road . Based on the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there should n't be any danger . " <p> " Where is this place , Gris ? " Batum asked . <p> " The most eastern port of the kingdom . " Brendel laughed . " The scenery there is n't bad at all , and the girls there are warm . You might even find a girl of your taste . " <p> Batums face actually turned red as he grumbled : " My lord , I 'm a mercenary who does n't  have a fixed place . " <p> Batum turned quiet . Although he looked like he was still holding on to the past , he was ready to try and move to a new direction . <p> " My lord , what about you ? " Batum asked after a moment . <p> " I have a few private things to settle " Brendel felt that it was a pity to lose the Thorn of Light in the auction site , but it was about time to switch to a better weapon after he was level twenty , and it was necessary to switch to a new weapon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed since the start of the month . Although reality was still within the acceptable levels of his plans , and the stay in Bruglas was a necessary must , he was just simply not satisfied even if he was moving at a reckless speed . <p> This was especially true after he encountered Tirste , and he felt the need to raise his strength once again . <p> There 's a need to move faster . The next target is still that sealed kingdom , but before that I need to confirm Ebdons words about the Lionheart . <p> Brendel did not dare to turn his back on this particular secret . <p> I need the Sage Slate to make the statue speak , but that 's a no go for the one coming into Bruglas in a few days . First of all I cant wait for it , and the second is I cant find five hundred thousand Tor to buy that . The best option is to get one by doing Instances . The nearest one is the Lost Forest near Rander , the Undead Temple Ruins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there with my level , and I just need a little preparation . Indeed , this is killing two birds with one stone since I can level up as well . <p> Batum did not say anything else after Brendel said he had other things to do , especially when his heart was taken to Gris . Brendels description of the place tickled his heart , as he had never seen the ocean before . <p> Romaine turned her head slightly to look at him and replied naturally : " Of course I 'm following you . " <p> But the lights in her eyes were obviously screaming Adventure ! Romaine is going on an adventure ! <p> " You 're not thinking about money ? " Brendel was stunned and he wanted to check her forehead to see if she was having a fever . <p> " Of course not , " Romaine swatted his hand away and said smugly : " Lady Romaine has distributed the task properly to Sue , and the only thing left is to invest the money . " <p> " Sue ? " Brendel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an icy expression , as he owed her a million Tor coins : " Isnt she Letos daugher ? " <p> " Yes . " She nodded : " She was looking for Freya . Since Im Freyas best friend , I can ask Sue for a little help , heh . " <p> " You really trust people too much " Brendel smacked her head lightly . This action was becoming a habit recently . <p> Romaines smile was like a little cunning fox . <p> " If that 's the case , I should stay back . " Amandina suddenly said . " This is supposed to be my job . " <p> Brendely immediately stopped to look at her . <p> " You cant stay behind . " <p> Mother Marsha above , you 're not staying here . Right now you and the future grandmaster Tamar are my greatest assets . Leaving both of you behind in this chaotic Bruglas is not an option . In order to guard against accidents , both of you are leaving this place . <p> Tamar had to bring his heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was a risk to have all his eggs in one basket , so he decided to take Amandina separately with him . <p> Its good that Romaine is coming too . Its easier for a girl to take care of another girl . <p> " Tirste is still here and you know his identity . The Unifying Guild is a formidable organization and there is too much risk to allow you to stay here . Romaine can take care of you if you come with me . " Brendel answered carefully after a moment . <p> " How can I do that ? " Amandina looked blankly at him . Even though she was slightly inclined towards adventuring , but she knew clearly that she could never adjust to that kind of life . For someone like her , adventuring was only something good in her dreams . <p> Some people obey their rash thoughts but Amandina had a good head about her . Even though she still wanted to refuse Brendel , Romaine broke through her defences . <p> " Of course you can , Amandina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Brendel . He nodded . <p> " Theres nothing else to be said . Everyone should go ahead and prepare . We will enter the city separately . I 'm going in alone in case that bastard Tirste comes after me again . Before the last star disappears in the morning , we will gather at the eastern gate .

@@37042234 @6042234/ <h> The Amber Sword Volume 2 Chapter 89 <p> TL : 2nd Chapter . I have translated the chapters till the end of the mini boss . A few things to note , quality might drop a little , and I 'm not too sure about the title for the chapters ( it is never stated whether there are king(s) or not . It might be just one king . <p> Chapter 89 The Kings and the dead ( 4 ) <p> The Spectral Knight raised its spear for the third time , moving much slower than before , and the Nightsong Tiger shot a bolt before it was ready to attack . The sky-blue Bolt of Wind struck the Spectral Knights horse from the front , and trails of colored wind wrapped around its hooves . <p> The binding magic was effective , and both the Spectral Knight and its mount were slowed down once again . <p> -12.7% <p> Brendel immediately pulled the Nighsong Tiger to safety while he read the effective data . The Spectral Knights attack had landed on their original positions . <p> That projectile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the stats of just an Iron-ranked fighter , the Mercenaries of Lopes are quite impressive indeed . Right now the distance we have is giving me enough time to read his moves , and we just need to lead him to the ambush . <p> The ambush was no more than fifty meters away . Brendel believed that the effects of the bolts were going to last more than two minutes , which gave them enough time to lure it . <p> The Spectral Knight thrust its lance after missing the third Vortex Strike . The lances stab through the air seemed to create a vaccum , which created an explosion of air rushing to fill its void , distorting the vision of the nearby trees into a maelstrom , causing them to break and crunch loudly , with the void rushing towards the two men . <p> Brendel quickly dragged the Nightsong Tiger behind the cover of the largest boulder while he summoned the Magic Control card in his hand . ( TL : Magic Control , a Planeswalkers card that seizes control of a magic . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this still works . <p> The card lit up brightly and the blast of air was directed back at the Spectral Knight , causing its body to shake massively . Brendel saw that it did more than three hundred damage and chortled in his mind . The thrusting of the lance made it seemed like a physical attack , but the gamers eventually discovered that it was Soul magic , and countered it by sealing off such properties to render it useless . <p> Because the Magic Control card was a counter-magic spell , he thought that it might work . The damage caused it to lose a third of its health , and Brendel was certain that it entered into a Stunned state , and would enter Stage Two of its boss phase . Brendel quickly pulled the Nightsong Tiger to his feet and they started to run to the location of the ambush . <p> The intelligence stat of the undead Spectral Knight was considerably high , so he was also certain that it would not use the same attack again . <p> When the Spectral Knight shrugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the ambush point with shallow breaths . They were pushed to their utmost limits from the very start . Even though the entire exchange was done in less than thirty seconds , they were starting to get tired . Brendels forehead was full of perspiration , which was no better than his own . <p> The Nightsong Tiger was certain that the Spectral Knight had not shown off its full prowess , so he looked at Brendel and wondered what other tricks he had that could reverse the situation . <p> Everyone at the ambushs location was also thinking of the same thing . <p> The Elementalists twins felt their limbs were turning cold when they saw the Spectral Knight made its first attack . The level of how it fought was beyond any battles they had before , and the strength that it had was beyond common sense . The younger sister even trembled as the older sister hugged her tightly , with both of them gritting their teeth and staying where they were . Any other mercenaries would surely have run away . <p> There was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war against the NPCs against the Kirrlutzs White Lucerne city with a population of five hundred thousand . Eleven Gold-ranked gamers fought in the war and caused half of the city to be destroyed . Even though the gamers were routed at the end , the damage that was caused by these high ranking adventurers were fully shown . <p> Every kingdom eventually tightened the control of such adventurers after that incident . <p> The damage of the Spectral Knight that it caused with the Seismic Blast silenced Amandina . The unending might of the Spectral Knight appeared like it could distort nature , and even though it was an illusion , it made her feel nothing but despair . <p> The Spectral Knight started to charge forward towards Brendel once again , covering an immense distance in a short period of time , and everyone held their breaths . <p> But a miracle seemed to happen . <p> The Spectral Knight suddenly stopped after charging through a certain point . It raised its head- and stared at the two men in front of it , then attacked with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweep across them . <p> The two currents of air rushed forward and caused deep gullies , forcing the nearby trees to bend and groan , but before it could strike Brendel and the Nightsong Tiger , they vanished . <p> What ? <p> The Spectral Knight paced back and forth against an invisible line , swinging its spear again and again , trying to slay the two men in front of it , but it was quickly proven that it was pointless to do so . Everyone started to wonder if Mother Marsha had given her blessings to their lord . <p> Amandina was initially surprised but she quickly became suspicious of how the events turned out . <p> Romaine was also in a state of nervousness , and she sighed with relief and showed a faint smile . <p> Auntie , little Romaine has an outstanding sweetheart <p> The mercenaries started to cheer loudly , while the Nightsong Tiger looked at Brendel in disbelief . Brendel had not relaxed in the slightest . He had estimated the distance correctly but the battle was not over . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knight . " <p> And everyone looked at him in disbelief . <p> " My lord , is n't this good enough ? We can hit him without being worried that he would hurt us ! " One of the mercenaries said , while a few others took out their crossbow and prepared to aim at it . They were somehow worried that their lord had gone half mad . <p> " My lord " The Nightsong Tiger began to speak . <p> " These are my orders ! Are you going to obey them , or not ? " Brendel roared loudly . The situation was not as simple as the mercenaries thought . Perhaps they thought that the undead was unintelligent , but if the situation continued as it was , the Spectral Knight would return to the temple . <p> He was the first to move into the attacking range of the Spectral Knight , which quickly reacted by slashing its lance in his direction . While he nimbly avoided the attacks , he shot another Bolt of Ice and caused damage to it . <p> Even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they still moved in once they saw Brendel did so . With the cumulative effects of the magic bolts , they were able to avoid the slow ranged attacks made by the undead monster . <p> The undead monster kept striking at them but it did not use the powerful Seismic Blast , and the Vortex Strike was continously interrupted by Brendel and the Nightsong Tiger . The mercenaries were delighted to see that the enemy could not reach them as they continued to scurry around it like rats , poking and hurling their projectiles at it , completely disregarding their image on how unsightly and cowardly they were acting . <p> The Nightsong Tiger could only expressed his astonishment in his heart . If the prowess of the Spectral Knight was beyond his imagination , the fight they had right now was the most bizarre he ever had . <p> Brendel was feeling a little smug when he saw the Nightsong Tigers expression . The gamers had spent countless hours trying to bend the rules in the game , and the endless creativity they had created numerous strategies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a well-known meme : <p> The more freedom a gamer has , the more cheats they possess. <p> They would always seek the easiest solution to solve a problem and never stick to common sense . If any resources and advantages were available , they would use it in order to defeat the enemies beyond their means . <p> Brendel believed in such a creed . They represented the crystallization of wisdom that would allow him to progress through the darkness and conquer this world that was full of difficulties and pain . He took out the remaining Bolts of Ice and tossed them to the mercenary commander .

He truly believed that he should not be too curious about things , because there were many moments where ignorance was the greatest bliss . <p> The heart from a black cat , the scales and nails from a lizard , dried worm skin .. Even though the little prince could not identify many of them , just looking at them was disgusting enough . When each bizarre ingredient went into the crucible , there was an increase of bubbles and stink that was like from a swamp . <p> Fedrus finally could not hold on to his sanity points . " What are you doing ? " <p> " Isnt it obvious ? Once its done you 're going to drink this . " <p> " You mean I have to drink this ? ! " He shrieked loudly " No ! You ca n't force a royal member to drink such a disgusting thing " <p> " Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Its fine if you want to leech off a girl , at the end of things , I 'll just collect my reward from your royal dad .. If you do n't  want this potion , once its done Ill just sell it later . " <p> " " Was this not the time to convince him as much as possible , or to soothe him and convince him to take it or something The little prince was conflicted . <p> There were many people who had this funny issue . When someone thought the best for someone else , he would feel that the person was a busybody and an eyesore . Like many boys and girls would find their mum irritating just because she hounded them to eat their meals on time and wear thicker clothes on cold days .. Such were the youths who could not understand this . <p> But the opposite might be true , once someone did not notice him or her , they start to wish for attention <p> Fedrus did not want to drink the potion desperately , but when Sue really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he felt really gloomy . He was certain of the effectiveness of the potion since she could cure his poison easily .. <p> In the end he drank it . Fortunately the potion was not as horrible smelling as the potion during the process , and he tried to hypnotize himself into thinking that this was a foreign races food that was a little harder to take in , like eating rats that was just born .. Bleah ! The socks from the Elven King ! He was wrong , that felt like it was much more disgusting than the potion . <p> " Hows your memory ? " Sue ignored the pale prince who was all on fours after drinking the potion . She took out a blank piece of paper and started drawing it and asked : " What I mean is , how many minutes do you need to memorize stuff from two images ? ! " <p> Hours ? ! The little prince held his chubby hand over his lips and thought for a while before replying : " If its not too difficult it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points do I need to remember ? " <p> " 720 . " <p> " . " Could one really remember all that within minutes .. Fedrus swallowed : " Can you let me see the images I need to remember first ? ! " <p> " Sure , its nearly done . " Sues action increased faster , and after a few minutes later , she passed over two images that had two bodies drawn on it : " The locations for the skill Eviscerate are very important . There are 720 points on the human body , and the fatal points are the ones in red , 36 of them , the ones that do serious damage are these 72 points which are in blue The rest of the different acupoints have different kinds of effects . If you do n't  intend to go too much in detail you can just remember where they are , they are all in black . " <p> Sue taught the evolutionary method that she made herself .. Her newer version had a very high chance to kill things instantly if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had weakened strength , this version was far better than the games . ( TL : I sense a disturbance in the force . ) <p> " " The little prince took a look at the papers that were passed to him . He was soon overwhelemed by the fine red , blue and black dots . His lips trembled and he asked in disbelief : " I need to remember all these ? ! <p> " If you do n't  want to its fine . " Sue was lazy to boost the boys morale , and she raised her hands up : " If you decide to give up , return them to me . " This was a Grandmasters technique , and she did not want to let it leak easily . <p> Fedrus was heartbroken . He felt like life was bullying him .. The choice before him was really hard . <p> Why cant this girl be more patient like the teachers in the royal court ? ! <p> Unfortunately he did not realize his position was the reason why his royal teachers were patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory from teaching him , they even receive benefits and a title . Under such encouraging bonuses , they had to be patient in order to continue to have a job But Sue did not need fame or rewards ! Right now she did not have any advantages and even had to feed the leeching boy . It was kind enough of her not to take a ruler and take good care of this royal flower <p> He was quickly shooed to one side where he obediently started to memorize the acupoints , while Sue generously stated she would prepare supper for him and make a memory potion if he really could not remember them . Fedruss enthusiasm suddenly went up and swore that he would not disappoint her No matter what he did not want to drink that sort of strange potion again ! <p> " Are you not afraid of the Tobias kingdom coming after you when you 're bullying their successor ? ! " The merfolk sighed and asked after looking at the scene . <p> " I can apply political asylum from their enemies . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over this new vocabulary for ten seconds , but quickly guessed the meaning : " Alright , if you do n't  mind that your skin will get wrinkled , our nearby water cities are willing to accept you for a while . There are quite a few exiled races who gather there and no one would travel that far to arrest them .. " <p> " I 'm not afraid of wrinkles , but I 'm scared of my skin dropping off . " Sue sighed . Did anyone really think their place was suitable to live ? ! That 's the area for pickled vegetables ! If she went there to stay for a few days , she could be picked up from that place to be cooked straight away without seasoning . <p> One night passed very quickly , Fedrus could not remember all 720 acupoints but he was considered successful as he memorized the vital 108 deadly acupoints <p> and now the new and improved ( not to mention deadly ) ( dramatic pause ) prince fedrus ! he can drink bitter things , memorize 108 dots on a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you save ( him ) now , you might even get a medal from his country <p> i have a feeling the prince will end up falling for her since she does n't  let him get his way like everyone else , also i have a feeling her being a grand master will eventually come out since shes not exactly hiding it : O would be interesting though cant wait to see what happens <p> When are we getting to something more plot relevance . Also , I dislike that the prince is learning new techniques and skills , because of the possibility of him being more advantageous or powerful than the lead heroine .

After the black panther finished its meal , it went off to find another herbivore . <p> This lesson proved that there was no lack of talent in this world , even if this one was gone , you could have that one The most important aspect is you had to have a bit of luck . <p> Fedrus and the little white tiger went off for a stroll with meat jerky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was hard to say if Fedrus was walking the tiger or the tiger walking the human . In any case , Sue finally had the time to go out with Blackie-bro to look for herbs .. Of course , she was in charge of the meal , including hunting and cooking . <p> Sue often went out to the forest , but she mostly did not walk . Either she rode the white tiger , or flew with the broom . But Blackie Bro accompanied her today , and she obviously could not abandon him and ride the broom . This was because she was above him and if there was any communication errors , it was easy to hurt feelings . Riding on the black panther was out of the question . <p> He was like the boss in this forest , or the equivalent of a human king . At best she was like the cook in the royal palace , and for a little female cook to ride on the body of a king .. <p> Half an hour later , Sue who still had stamina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long more before we reach the medicine that I need ? " She was still at the first ingredient , and to find all the six herbs , she had to make preparations to camp outside . <p> " . " The black panther bared his fangs to laugh at Sue with contempt . <p> The herbivore that was leading the way trembled . Whether it could live or not depended on its usefulness . But there was also the mood of the two violent and cruel monsters behind it . Now that monster number two was unhappy , did it mean that it was unable to escape the fate of being eaten ? !

Edit : Theres a mistake in which the chapter did not copy over ( damned umatrix extension ) . <p> Chapter 92 The kings and the dead ( 7 ) <p> ============ ? ? ? POV ============ <p> Am I in a dream ? <p> The Silver Elven Court was as perfect as my memories . The saintly white luster of the walls , ceilings , corridors and fences . <p> How long ago have I not dreamt of this <p> " Sister . " <p> " What did you address me ? " That voice in my dreams became sharp as usual . <p> " I-Im sorry . " <p> That dream <p> I remember my mother said to me , when I pressed gently on my chest , I would be able to feel my warmth and life from my heart with my fingertips .

He had calmed down from the shock , and thought if he saw it through a gamers perspective , this would be a developers immunity settings , that it was a follow-up to a quest and possibly the key to activating the Altar , and even though he could probably find the answer on his own <p> Did it not look like the solution was in front of him ? <p> If this is a mission , then this little girl is going to wake up pretty soon . The only exceptions thus far in this world are the Planeswalker and the cards <p> Brendel looked up at the starry sky and waited patiently , wondering if the spirits also adhered to the game . <p> The mercenaries whispered amongst themselves , as Amandina grabbed Romaines hand and watched the Silver Elf warily . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still beside her . The might exhibited by the Spectral Knights mount was still fresh in their minds and nobody knew whether it would go on a rampage . <p> But it was just as Brendel had predicted , the Elven girls eyelids moved and opened . <p> It was a pair of slightly vacant silver eyes with a little confusion in her eyes , which quickly seemed to be poured in with many things all at once . It was as if memories and complicated emotions filled her eyes up as it suddenly flickered with comprehension . <p> Her body moved a little , and she turned her head around to look at everyone around her . <p> She seemed to recall something , before she her brows were crunched into a sorrowful expression . Her body curled up as she coughed vehemently , and she brought her hands to her lips . Once she uncovered them , her hands were filled with silver blood . She reached out with her hands , trying to grasp the silver lance on the ground . <p> The mercenaries pulled out their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them wanted to stop her . <p> " My lord , she has no more strength left to fight us . " Amandina quickly tried to persuade Brendel into stopping the mercenaries . She recognized the expressions of the Silver Elf , which was how she felt when she was at her lowest point . <p> Indeed , she has no strength left . <p> Brendel nodded . The spirit had reached the final stage of fading away . Even if he was to stand in front of her , she would not even be able to raise her weapon to strike him down . The spirit was holding on to some wish or mission to persist in this world . It was also the source of her Soul Energy . Once it was gone , she would have no more connection with this world . <p> After a short moment , the girl suddenly stopped and stared at her transparent hand . It was becoming fainter and seemed like it was going to disappear anytime . <p> Brendel raised his hand to make everyone stop , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck fear in the mercenaries hearts , then the Elven girl in front of them was so weak and pitiful that they felt like they needed to protect her . <p> " Messere Am I going to disappear ? " The Silver Elf stared at her hand while she spoke . Her voice was like the fabled nightingales within the deepest forest . <p> Her tone made the twin Elementalists gasp . The Wild Elves were considered as great musicians , and they could hear how beautiful and trance-like the voice was . <p> There are two Elven blood lineage that were derived from the Golden Bloodline . The first is the Silver Elves , the latter is the Mist Elves . As expected , the voice from a Silver Elf is beautiful . <p> Brendel nodded silently to the Silver Elfs question . The related quest indeed came , but he felt he was unable to feel happy . If it was in the game , he would have seen her as a NPC , but at this moment , he discovered that he was unable to cut his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but silently nodded . Her arms and legs were becoming transparent as well . She looked up to sky with a melancholic smile , and said with a tearful voice : " I killed so many people Mother Marsha , must have abandoned me " <p> " That is not your fault . " Brendels voice sounded angry . <p> The Holy Cathedral of Flames was the faction that caused this incident . Mother Marsha would not have gotten angry if it was not for their interference . As punishment , luck as never been on Aouine side ever since then . <p> Brendel had essentially made sense out of the entire situation . <p> The priests of the Holy Cathedral of Flames probably wanted to change the oath between the Elven kings , the Elven Goddess and Mother Marsha . He personally had changed similar contracts before as a gamer , and the risk presented to him was acceptable precisely because he was a gamer . The citizens of Aouine must had been either bold or greedy enough to attempt something like this , and the conclusion was distorting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was a tragedy . <p> The evil spirits surely did not stop at controlling just the little girl , and many more Elves must have been possessed . Despite that , the high ranking priests were not simple pushovers and a dire battle not recorded in history broke out in this area . After the battle ended , all records of the Altar disappeared . <p> " What is your name " Romaine asked . <p> Brendel suddenly discovered her question was really constructive . <p> " Medissa Lunette . " Came the reply . <p> " " You 're not from the royal family ? " " Brendel and Amandina spoke at the same time . Only the royal bloodline , the Aavlon royal lineage , was permitted to enter this tomb . <p> " Yes , I am a craftsmans daughter . " <p> " But this is the tomb of the Elven kings " Amandina continued to ask . <p> The question from Amandina made the Elven girl paused for a while . Half of her body was becoming transparent : " There are unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of the Silvers Elves interring their bravest and greatest heroes along with the ancient kings " Amandina looked doubtfully at the girl , unable to find traces of a greatest hero in her . <p> Medissa carassed the unicorn beside her as her eyes became misty : " That is n't it . I am here to replace someone else . " <p> What ? <p> If there was another mouthful of water in Brendel , he would have spat it out again . He had never heard of substitutes or was there a queue for being entombed ? <p> Amandina had a clearer grasp of the situation . " A replacement in order to save someone ? Or to be buried as a sacrifice ? " <p> What kind of third rate development is this ? To think that the noble elves would also do something like this , looks like they are no different compared to humans . Brendel was surprised . <p> But Medissa shook her head : " I volunteered . " <p> " Volunteered ? " Brendel could not understand how an ordinary citizen was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a faint smile on her face , as though she had recalled a memory to be proud of . " I , volunteered to replace my older sister No , I came here for the sake of the her Royal Princess . " <p> She was becoming fainter . <p> " Hold on . " Brendel interrupted her , " Sister ? Her Royal Princess , what do you mean by that ? " <p> " My mother , is a craftsman in the Cherau village . My father , is the king of Aavlon . I think , I am half a princess " <p> " Does this mean your sister is the Silver Elves Kingdoms princess ? " <p> She nodded . <p> " Why did you need to replace her ? " <p> " My noble sister was cursed by the Miirna people . The royal court magicians told me father that a related blood member had to die for her sake , or else she will continue to weaken in her prime until she died . " Medissa slowly explained : " But my noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human allies , the dwarves , our citizens , no one wished to see that happen " <p> " In the end , my father chose me . " <p> Amandina was so indignant that her brows knitted together tightly : " He s your father , how could he have done something like this ! " <p> Brendel could only pat her on her shoulders to calm her down . " During the era of Chaos , the twilight dragon was a force that exceeded the imaginations of the various races . They paid a great price in order to resist that existence , as the king of the Silver Elves , it could only be seen as something normal . " <p> He stared at Elven girl in silence , before he asked : " Why have you told us about all these ? " <p> " Because I wish to ask you for help ? " <p> Just like a mission . <p> " What help do you need ? " <p> " The lizardmen in the forest had stolen my sisters necklace . I do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without that trinklet , my sisters curse would not be able to focus on me , I 'm afraid it would " <p> " Youre already about to disappear , why are you still trying to care about someone else ! " Amandina interrupted her after listening in dissatisfaction . <p> Medissa cast a glance at her and smiled . <p> " Precisely so , I wish .. That my disappearance .. has meaning .. " <p> Amandina did not know how to refute her . <p> " But this matter is none of our business . We do have the right to refuse your request . " Brendel spoke quietly . Even though logic told him that he should accept the quest , but he felt a little angry when he looked at the Elven girl who had nothing to do with the cruelties and violence in the world . <p> Her eyes momentarily turned sad , but was quickly replaced with a touch of slyness : " Messere human , you came to seek , for the souls of the Ancestral Elves right ? " <p> She was nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I was able to listen in , through the gust of wind in the valley " She closed her eyes . " To gain the acknowledgement of the Ancestral Elves , you would have to gain my acknowledgement " <p> She paused for a moment , as though she was too tired to continue speaking . " That is why , I want to make a deal with you . " <p> I 'm actually being held hostage . And I 'm even threatened by a little girl . <p> Brendel felt bitter feelings emerging from his heart . Did he had the option to get angry ? He turned back to look at everyone , but the girls and even the Nightsong commander nodded their heads . <p> " Very well , but I have also have my own request . In order to deal with the lizardmen bandits , I would have to gather the help of the Ancestral Elves , otherwise I would not be able to deal with them . " <p> The girl nodded . <p> " I acknowledge your presence and you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I will betray you ? " Brendel was slightly surprised . <p> Medissa was silent for a moment . " I am worried . " <p> She started coughing and flecks of blood could be seen spluttering out , before it disappeared into thin air . She raised her head weakly , as tears spilled across her face : " I 'm worried .. I do not wish to disappear . I still have things that I want to do . I 'm really sorry , can you help me .. please ? " <p> A sudden rush of wind blew across the top of the forest , as though it was wailing while Medissa completely vanished before their eyes . <p> Everyone was stunned into silence as the heartrending pleadings wormed their way into their hearts . Each word seemed to hang around their ears , and Brendel had an inscrutable expression . <p> This reminds me of when my friends were talking about Game of Thrones season 5-6 which I have n't seen as of yet .

@@37042244 @6042244/ <h> The Amber Sword Volume 2 Chapter 80 <p> TL : One more chapter coming in about two to three hours later . This chapter is kind of complicated and I 'm not sure if its easy enough to understand . Just ask which part you do n't  understand and I 'll see what can be done . <p> Chapter 80 The story of fishes swimming in chaos ( 2 ) <p> Amandina watched Redis back as he limped away , while Yula was beside helping him walk . <p> " But I still feel like you 're scheming something . " She glanced at him with slight suspicion . <p> Brendel rubbed his nose with a dry smile : " Is my character that awful in your eyes ? I thought that I did things openly in the past . " <p> " Yes , it would appear so . But I have never thought that my lord has ever done things that appear to be as simple as they look . I recall that you arranged miss Freya to enter the Royal Cavalry Academy , which could be seen like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because you noticed the fights between the Royal Faction and the Regional Nobles . <p> If I recall correctly , the Royal Cavalry Academy is within princess Gryphines private lands , and she 's the most outstanding individual out of the current royal family members . Not only that , the younger and weaker brother of hers is strictly cared for by her , almost like a guardian and not as an older sister . <p> Based on the kings health , it is likely that the princess will become a Princess-Regent in the future . Once that happens , my lords action will also become a long-term investment . " <p> Romaine nodded quickly when she heard the words investment . <p> " These other invisible investments that you made from the time that I met you might not look like they are of any use in the beginning , but once my lord has your lands and reap the benefits that you have sown earlier , then you will become a direct supporter of princess Gryphine . <p> If it is someone else , I would think nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people close to my lord will surely understand that your ambition is nothing as straightforward as it seems . " <p> Amandina looked up to Brendel : " Am I wrong , my lord ? " <p> The young girl took a long breath after she finished her speech . She had spent a lot of time speculating in the past few days because Brendels actions were becoming stranger and stranger , to the point where she did not understand them at all , and she did not wished to fall behind too much . <p> Especially if she was the chief advisor . <p> Brendel blinked a few times before he answered : " Youre close enough . " <p> Although you missed a few points . <p> He thought to himself . <p> Rather than call it an investment , I would rather call it a relationship . There 's no need for me to gain honor here , what I need is something I can grow and use in the future . A gamer is different from a lord , especially when I have that land in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strife within Aouine reach its highest point , with Madara invading the kingdom with its full might , until the Princess-Regent would finally not be able to control the situation , then garner the biggest profits by stepping in at that point . <p> But he did not do so . <p> His attachment to the people in the game made him send the future Goddess of War to the princess , and believed that these two brilliant women would not disappoint him . Even if he predicted wrongly , at least he would not leave behind any regrets . <p> Still , he did not expect Amandina to know his thoughts that well , so he merely smiled and gave a neutral reaction . She certainly showed off her intelligence if she was able to predict that much . <p> He turned back to look at Romaine who looked like she was having fun . She did not seek to understand why Brendel needed to do what he did , and only wanted to help him do the best he could in his plans . <p> The future ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much hurts , and one might not attain happiness , Amandina But looking at Romaine makes me feel its a pleasure on its own . <p> " Beyond that , " Amandina continued : " The money made from the auction was invested into Miss Romaines goods which were subsequently used for the celebration after the Madara war . The returns were then poured to gain deep access into this local region . This is the first time that I realize that having gold coins is an amazing thing . Miss Romaines touch seemed to go permeate into the complicated noble society and the underground thieves guilds . <p> There was n't even a need to maintain a good relationship in order to gain access to the information too . I thought it was only at Bruglas that contact was made with the Brotherhood of Thieves , but it seems like it was done much earlier . " <p> " This is one of the reasons why I formed a coalition of merchants . " Brendel admitted it : " But it is not for the reason of acquiring more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of any system , even if they have their own personal agenda , their actions would most likely benefit others just like how the circulation of goods would bring about abundance . " <p> " Information gathering is n't really hard . My aunt says that information is everywhere around us . " Romaine interrupted as if she was interested in the topic . <p> " Thats because the information we require is n't particularly demanding on quality . The hardest part on acquiring information is not on the process of collection , but to determine which information is useful . This requires skilled professionals . " Brendel gave a laugh . <p> " My lord , you 're changing the subject . All the things that you do is because there 's some form of benefit . " Amandina gazed at him . <p> " Even if you point out only these two things , I can only say that they are a coincidence . " Brendel did not wish to spend time on this topic . He had too many secrets and each lie that he gave , would inevitably lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The Red Bronze Dragon mercenaries retired as if they wanted to stay away from the publics attention , but I can safely state that it was a measure to make sure Miss Freya enters the Royal Cavalry Academy But my lord , how did you know there were openings in the academy ? No , not only that , it seems that my lord has the ability to see even further . While we are still focused on the problems before us , you seemed to have already seen the end results . " <p> Amandina looked a little i 'll and grumbled . <p> " I-Im not sure if this is some form of talent , but I feel tremendous pressure . " <p> " Alright , alright , " Brendel quickly raised his hands to surrender : " I got it . You 're right , its a form of talent . But there are areas that I can miss out if I plan things alone " <p> He looked at the trees into the distant . The night battle seemed to intensify as the camps started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with red light . Their location was starting to become unsafe . <p> This was a temporary stop after all . <p> " Were discussing too many things that are not related to our current situation . We should leave this area before the fight reaches here . " <p> He quickly ended his sentences and grabbed the longsword near him and fled from Amandina , and prevented her from asking more questions . <p> At this rate you 're going to even get my identification number Brendel obviously would not divulge himself as a parallel-world traveler with knowledge about the future . <p> Amandina understood that it was a poor attempt to change the topic , but she had gone a little too far by saying too much . It was normal for a leader to keep things from his subordinates , and Brendels foresight boosted the confidence she had in the things they were doing . <p> Thus she followed him without any objections . <p> A few moments later she turned around and whispered : " Ser Nightsong Tiger , are we really fine if we head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and saw him making a scornful face when Brendel said they were going east . <p> The Nightsong Tiger looked at her with an impressed expression . <p> " Yes . " He added a motion to pat his left arm , which was a gesture to guarantee something : " Miss Amandina , I have never seen anyone like my lord who is as familiar with these bastards who deserve to go straight to hell <p> He looked at Brendels back . <p> " I say this humbly , we have frequently fought them in the past , and the Disciples of the Black Flames love to use distractions as a strategy . However , it is difficult to discern their true locations . Even if its me , I can only pinpoint their ambushes to two locations , either in the south or west area . " <p> He pointed towards Brendels injured hand . <p> " Do you see our lords wounded hand ? I 'm willing to bet that he took less than a minute to deal with that high ranking contract demon , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a veteran can see through the Lord of Throns attacking style and approach this monster quickly . Even though it has a wide range , it is far less threatening to fight in close combat . " <p> Amandina listened to his explanation and understood about half of it . It was evident that the veteran soldier was immensely respectful of Brendel . As she looked at Brendels injuries on his back and hand , she suddenly realized something . <p> The current generation of Aouine nobles were soft , unlike their ancestors . <p> Brave , wise , decisive and tough . A lord like this makes me wonder how far his accomplishments will go.

Please report any Engrish mistakes . Chapters links should be corrected now . <p> I 'm also really sorry for those of you who missed chapter 91 , that was a nasty accident . <p> Chapter 93 The Eversong Elves <p> The winds died down and the forest sank back into silence . <p> Brendel deliberated for a moment before he looked back at the girls . They were looking at the Elven girls with teary eyes . Even though they were enemies a moment ago , they quickly realized that it was not Medissas fault for attacking them . <p> " Do you wish to save her ? " Brendel suddenly asked . <p> Romaine snapped her head to look at Brendel and furiously nodded . Amandina hesitated and bit her lips , but every time she wanted to say something her words did not come out . <p> ( Nightsong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . <p> ( My lord ? ) The Nightsong Tiger faced him . <p> ( I have been wondering about the abilities for quite some time , but is it possible for me to turn the Elven girl into a card ? ) <p> Brendel had wondered from time to time as to how Ciel and the Mercenaries of Lopes came about . The only answer he had was that a Planeswalker was somehow able to seal them into cards . <p> ( Yes , you can do so , my lord . This Elven girls abilities are incredibly powerful , and if you try to seal her , she might turn out to be a high quality summon card . At your current abilities , you can only spend up to a maximum of 100 Wealth and a little mana to seal something into a card . With this amount of resources spent of sealing , you can only seal someone who 's extremely weak and willing to be sealed . ) The Nightsong Tiger explained quickly . <p> ( Thats fine ) <p> ( But my lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed . 100 Wealth is approximately a months worth of your savings . ) <p> Brendel shook his head . Even though a loss of 100 Wealth was painful if she rejected it , he needed to do this . <p> ( If I do n't  do this , I feel that I would carry this regret in my life . ) Brendel gave an embarrassed smile . His past regrets in not saving the NPCs from the slave merchants , his guilt in fleeing Aouine after Freya died , the things that he could not achieve in his past life , he wanted to absolve himself of such feelings . <p> For what purpose have I come to this world ? This is a chance for Medissa , but this is also a chance for myself <p> He formed a blank card in his Deck according to the Nightsong Tigers instructions . The card was a blank canvas , as though it was waiting for a guest to move into it . <p> " What is that ? " Romaine saw Brendel taking a card out of from nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save the little Elven girl . " The Nightsong Tiger explained : " He s going to transfer her soul into the card and stablize the Soul Fire that 's collasping . " <p> " That sounds like the abilities of a summoner , but do n't  they use crystals for that ? Can you seal souls aside from magical beasts ? " Amandinas eyes glinted as she asked . <p> " You can think of it as a type of summoning . " The Nightsong Tiger answered : " But this is done because its the only way to let the girl stay here . " <p> The girls nodded . If the Soul Fire broke down , the energy was returned to its basic elements and not returned to the embrace of her goddess . Disappearing in that manner was the most painful way for a spirit , not to mention a sentient one . <p> Brendel raised the card into the air : " Medissa Lunette , do you wish to join in my travels and become part of the Laws in this world ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someones else voice spoke them . The blank card flew out from his hands and floated in the air . Brendel waited for a full minute before he repeated his words again , but no reply came . A mellow sadness spread within his heart as he sighed inwardly , certain that Medissa had refused and was gone . <p> " I have a wish , can you grant me that ? Brendel .. No , Lord Planeswalker . " Medissas voice echoed in his mind . <p> Brendels elation soared and he exhaled loudly . <p> " Of course , Miss Lunette . Please state your request . " <p> " I wish to see my sister on your journeys , just once would be fine . " Came the small voice . <p> Brendel was slightly dumbfounded . He did not think that her wish was so simple . Even if she requested to have full freedom , he could agree to it . <p> The Silver Elves had superior bloodlines and their lives were exceedingly long . Perhaps her father and older sister were still alive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , the Silver Elves avoided contact with the world and might be slightly troublesome to find them . <p> He nodded after a few moments . <p> The card immediately emitted a flash of black light , and the words were written in his retina : <p> " Contract established . " <p> A line came next : <p> " A new card has been found , please name it " <p> " Eversong . " Brendel decided to name Medissa after the most famous Silver Elves army from the ancient era . <p> The card gradually came back to his hand . Brendel inspected the card , and saw a female knight equipped with silver armor and a long lance in her hands . She wore a warm and friendly smile It was the very image of Medissa . <p> The flag of the Elves are raised proudly , with her heart and sword shining brightly in darkness. <p> Brendel stared at the card for some time . The response from the card seemed to show off the difference compared to his other cards . <p> Amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighter , I did n't  think that that she 's on the level of a legendary artifact .

Guahahaha ! <p> Brendel roared with laughter inside his mind . If it was not for the fact that he would ruin his image because of the people around him , he would shamelessly laughed with a greedy voice . He had constantly faced ridiculously overpowered enemies one after another , and was starting to wonder if he was cursed with some unlucky status . <p> He was not really afraid of the Unifying Guild , Tree Shepherds or the Madara army , but being targeted by them at every waking moment made him feel awful . <p> I finally have a Gold-ranked follower . This is at least enough for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even if the Tree Shepherds or the Unifying Guild have the numbers , they cant possibly send a Gold-ranked assassin after me right ? <p> The two organizations only sent such assassins after highly ranked earls , and he thought he had not reached a threatening level yet . With Medissas abilities , he would be able to combine their abilities to fight against any such threats . <p> A good deed is rewarded . Brendel was proud of himself and felt like there was sunshine everywhere . <p> He wiped off his crooked smile and turned back to everyone : " Its done , everyone . " <p> The girls eyes shone brightly , and Romaine even urged him impatiently : " Thats wonderful ! Quick , summon Medissa to let us take a look at her . " <p> " Ahem .

She lightly gasped and answered with a pause on every word : " My responsibility for failing to defeat you Only the weak .. would save themselves by betraying others . " <p> " Really ? " Conrad did not get angry : " But you see , I 'm not a patient man . As both you and I know , the Grey Wolves Mercenaries have seventy to eighty of their men here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice themselves for other strangers .

I can assure you that I do n't  enjoy killing , so I 'm giving you one more chance , little girl , otherwise you 're going to that useless goddess Mother Marsha . " <p> Scarletts eyelids twitched , and he waited with bated breath . In the end the girl gritted her teeth and shook her head . <p> " The other mercenaries are not me . " Her reply was curt . <p> " Then farewell , little girl . " <p> Scarlett tensed her body and paled . She was a normal human being who still feared death at the last moment , but it still did not overcome her willpower . She feebly clenched her fists and waited for her fate , closing her eyes tightly while two streaks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The high-ranking Disciple of the Black Flames who had stood behind Conrad throughout the interrogation nodded his head once . It was just like what Conrad said , the mercenaries were already in their trap and there was nowhere to run . There was no need to worry . Even though the mercenaries were not afraid to die in battle , they would not easily give up their life to meaningless loyalty or honor . <p> Makarov and Buga needed to keep their secrets , but the men under them did not . <p> Conrad took the dagger and plunged it into the girls chest . <p> The disciple looked coldly at this scene . The red blood that flowed from the girl did not look like a life was ending , but more of a painting to be admired . She gurgled and her body convulsed a few times , causing her red hair to flutter about . Her eyes opened wide and she looked like she was thinking of something in her final moments , but they quickly became vacant and void of all expressions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . <p> Am I dying .. ? Eke do you know that I really like She felt extremely sleepy , but felt something was placed onto her chest before she fell to a sleep she would not wake up from . <p> " What is that ? " Conrad turned his head back and asked . <p> The disciple had placed a glowing dark ruby on the girls body . In a few moments , the ruby extended dark tendril-like lights around the wound . The dark lights passed through the veins of the girl and her body quickly gave out a faint crimson glow . <p> " The Divine Blood of a God . " He said . <p> " Do you wish to awaken her as an undead ? " Conrad asked . <p> " No . " He shook his head . " This woman has an Element Resonance with her weapon , and even defeated our high ranking disciple with just her current status as a Silver-ranked fighter . This means that her potential is very high , and with such a tender age as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lightning God , Cabal . If she raises as an God Acolyte , then this gamble is worth it to me . " <p> " Blood from a high ranking God ? " Conrad narrowed his eyes : " You 're a lower ranked bishop . How did you get your hands on the blood jewel when you do n't  even have the qualifications to handle it ? " <p> " A mere coincidence . Luck plays a great factor , as dictated by the highest truth in this world , chaos . " <p> Conrad gave an incomprehensible hum in response to that , and looked back at Scarlett . The tendrils were gradually turning her body into a cocoon . <p> " The chance for failure is very high . " Conrad said . <p> " The loss is acceptable . " The disciple said coldly . <p> " You can do whatever you want , my next move is going to launch an attack . You had better stay back . Makarov and Buga are not your common fodder . If both of them put their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that favorable . " <p> Conrad got up and place his white gloved hand on his sword . Even though he could supposedly lose his life , there was no tremor to his hand . The disciple knew that he was in charge of their current mission , so he did not oppose his rudeness . He moved to one side to allow Conrad to pass , then spoke suddenly : " The group that left the Grey Wolves Mercenaries , is that truly Eke ? " <p> " The possibility is almost certain . " Conrad continued to walk towards the edge of the forest and spoke without turning his head : " Regardless of they do , they wont be able to escape here . If I want them to die here , then they would assuredly be dead . " <p> The disciple merely gave a sneering smile at Conrads declaration . <p> ============= Brendel POV =============== <p> The silence was quickly broken within the quiet forest <p> " My lord , do you mean to say you knew that Eke was Duke Lantonrands son since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amandina . I was only suspicious of his identity in the beginning . " Brendel sighed . " But seeing Miss Yula made me certain of that fact . She is not only a Star Seer , her other identity is Ekes fiancee . I had seen them before in the Black Tower . " ( TL : Black Tower probably refers to where the wizards congregate . ) <p> A lie , of course . I have n't been to the Black Tower in this world yet . Not that anyones going to break my lie anyways . But its true that Yula is Ekes fiancee and the most famous Star Seer in Aouine in the future . At the same time , her capabilities in the battlefield are beyond imagination . <p> Brendel clearly remembered that Yula was a Chosen , and her blindness was proof of that . Mother Marsha favored certain humans , but mortals were imperfect and unable to receive such pure divine energy , resulting in a damaged body . <p> Over Vauntes long history , only two Chosens did not have any defects on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the other future emperor of Madara who possessed the Mercury Staff . The other Chosens might have been famous , but they were still flawed . <p> Telling them that Yula would be a Grandmaster Brawler who awakened her Element status and was at a peak level of 115 , will be treated like a running joke . She aided the Princess Regent and the Goddess of War to form a stalwart defense against Madara . Right now , her abilities as a Chosen have not awakened yet Hold on , is there a possibility that she awakens her abilities in this battlefield ? <p> Brendel wanted Yulas abilities , but she was already in Ekes faction and they were still loyal to the Royal faction . The civil war would temporarily shake their loyalty , but the couple ultimately emerged victorious and pledged their support for the Princess Regent . Unfortunately , the two prodigies died in the war and left behind a daughter , Airrah Lantonrand Orphelon , who led the Aouines final resistance against Madara . <p> At that time , Brendel had left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brendel rapid thoughts were interrupted by Amandinas reply who sounded like she doubted him . <p> " You mean to say that the fight between these two mercenary groups are a cover for the nobles civil war , while Makarov is actually Duke Rhuns retainer ? The Grey Wolves Mercenaries are actually the guards of Eke , and the mercenaries of Paper Cards are hired as assassins ? " <p> " No , the majority of the Grey Wolves Mercenaries probably do not know the real truth behind their commander . " Brendel explained : " When Duke Arreck was in control of the political arena , the entire family of Duke Rhun was nearly wiped out by assassins . I 'm sure you have heard of that incident . " <p> " Yes , the nobles blood that was shed on that day caused great political changes in a month . Its not possible for me to be ignorant of it " Amandinas eyes shimmered . <p> " Duke Rhun knew that the assassination was coming , and he planned to send his only son away . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his other family members in order to protect his only child . " Brendel sighed and answered wearily . <p> Amandina did not respond after listening to Brendels explanation . The fights between nobles were bloody and difficult . From a certain point of view , Duke Rhuns actions were understandable . <p> Romaine merely glanced around , seemingly disinterested in this topic . <p> " Then instead of an assassination , they would want to capture his only son to threaten him ? " Amandina asked again after a short while . <p> " Yes , an astute observation . " Brendel praised her : " Duke Rhun is currently the strongest supporter of the royal family , and if someone wants to act against them , they would naturally need to shake this pillar . " <p> " That would mean " <p> Amandina frowned with worry . Even though a chaotic civil war was an advantage to them , she was still a citizen of Aouine , and did not wish to see the worst outcome happening . <p> " No more than three months . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements of the Paper Cards and the Disciples of the Black Flames from the beginning ? He used his own mercenaries as bait ? " <p> " Most likely . " <p> The girl took a deep breath and sighed wistfully . The entire Grey Wolves Mercenaries consisted of more than a hundred men and women altogether . There were people who had served Makarov for over a decade . <p> She understood that being merciless was the only way to survive in a cruel war , but she still felt a certain chill spreading throughout her entire body when she experienced it first hand . She cast a glance at Brendels youthful face . <p> I wonder if my lord is going to be like them in the future <p> Brendels eyes were already placed somewhere else as he prepared himself to solve a troublesome problem . <p> So the reason why Scarlett transform into undead in the game was because of the evil bishop tried to revive the dying Scarlett into an God Acolyte . Maybe this time around she will really turn into one . Perhaps Brendel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She will be a very strong ally if she revives successfully since the God Acolyte in the game are overpowered enemies .

Brendel already regained his senses and started to curse Redi in his mind . <p> Makarov still managed to make use of him even though he escaped to the east to avoid such a situation from developing . He took a deep breath and penned it down inside his mind . When he had the time , he would visit Lantonrand and get the score even . Right now , he needed to deal with the dolt in front of him . <p> Ill probably lose ten years of my life if I have to talk with this crazy person any longer . <p> But before he had the chance to speak , Sanford had already cut into the conversation : " So to sum it up Redi , you joined hands with the Paper Cards Commander , Conrad ? " <p> Brendel turned to look at Sanford , only to witness his calm face with a pair of cold eyes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was mildly disappointed . Brendel did not think this friendly youth had a steely side to him . <p> Redi was surprised by Sanfords words . He looked at his former allies who were glaring at him with anger , then back at Sanfords gaze who made him shrink back . <p> But these angry gazes stoked his feelings to resist and he scoffed coldly : " Its that simple . Ca n't you see that Makarov has abandoned us ? The old fucker had only treated us like usable pawns . Why should I continue to work for him ? Why cant I choose a better option ? " <p> " Thus you came over to kill us and display your loyalty to your new owner ? " Sanfords voice was biting : " I am your best friend . These men and women were once your comrades .

" <p> " Were the same as well ! " The remaining Grey Wolves Mercenaries spoke bitterly . <p> Brendel watched the scene unfold in front of him , but he was constantly on the alert to see if the situation changed . However , Sanford suddenly turned and bowed to him . <p> " Ser Brendel , Redi is right in saying that Makarov had abandoned us . The old commander had treated us like family for over a decade , whatever hatred that we have is negated by that fact . From this moment forth , we are a group of pitiful worms who is being hunted right now . If you would lend a hand to save us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task that you have for us . We merely wish to live . " <p> Brendel was slightly surprised and he looked at the rest of the mercenaries , and realized that the refugees more or less accepted Sanfords suggestion . It was clear that the youth had considerable influence amongst them . <p> But he tilted his head and looked at Redi : " Though it is true that I can save you , that bastard over there said that I have a deep relationship with Makarov . Even if that 's the case , can you still accept it ? " <p> " That fool has been taken over by the mere thought of revenge . He is no different from a moron ! Who would believe what he s saying ? " One of the mercenaries with a burly figured snapped . <p> Brendel turned back to Sanford and the latter merely nodded . <p> He was secretly laughing inside as that he thought the moron Redi did not entirely do bad deeds .

He had opened his mouth in an exaggerated manner which made Brendel feel really irritated to the point where he wanted to rip a new one for him . <p> " Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! " The white-haired youth laughed three times . " Take care of me ? Ser Brendel , oh , or should I say , Ser Eke . It seems like you have not understood the situation you are in .

" <p> He walked to Scarletts back as he spoke , reaching out to her face in order to pat it . However , the latter batted his hand away and glared coldly at him . He coughed once in embarrassment to clear his throat . It was good that his former comrades did not notice his plight . <p> That was because Sanford and the others were shocked at the strength of his forces , and even wondered how the crazy fool managed to get Scarlett working for him . They only saw that there was something odd about her , as though she did not recognize them at all . <p> They subconsciously took a step back . Were they going to die today ? <p> They looked at the their new boss , but everyone was stunned at his reaction . That young merchant actually had the time to comfort his female companions <p> " Do n't  worry , you can ignore that narcissist .

They were certain of who was the one going to be in trouble . Their lord might look like he was a straightforward person but he was actually a sly and devious person , and there was no way he would let himself get into a disadvantageous situation . <p> The Grey Wolves Mercenaries could only look on and scream inside their hearts as they looked at Brendels reaction . <p> But Brendels actions of ignoring Redi had the effect he wanted .

Redi looked at him with a confused look . It was late for him to beg for mercy when his orders are already given . The disciples had already rushed out with a fervor and would not stop for any other orders . He thought it was just as well for the disciples to attack them and let Brendel know the meaning of fear . <p> " Continue to pretend , you bastard " He muttered angrily . <p> The Grey Wolves Mercenaries immediately paled . Their limbs were cold and shivering , but they still took up their weapons and intended to fight to their deaths . They still clung to their namesake and oaths for the Grey Wolves Mercenaries . <p> Redi glared at their resistance , as though he wanted to enjoy looking at the idiots who wanted to oppose him .

They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a long while before they were formed into a coherent sentence : <p> " Unfortunately , you 're too early . " <p> I 'm too early ?

Even the idiotic random bragging moments of the protagonist , in which he blow his cover for no reason if not to satisfy a shallow sense of gratification ( I do n't  know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or both ) , werent that destructive , but the persona of Redi took such a turn that succeeded in breaking down to pieces my suspension of disbelief This is n't madness , nor true fear , or a greedy attempt to prove his shaken sense of worth , this is simply a silliness . Well , I hope he will exit the scene quickly , since he is the first character in the whole novel that semeed to only reapond to a chinese trope . <p> Thank you very much for your translations and the cliffhanger ( many love to you for both &lt;3 )

On the side were three necromancers controlling these low level undead . They were of a classic design ; a skeleton wearing long robes , its hand holding on to a bone wand , with green fiery eyes darting around as it inspected the low level skeleton soldiers . <p> Brendels grandfathers old house sat on a hilltop not far away from Bucce and was able to oversee the entire village from below . This was like a small manor that was located beside the town . There were originally five or six families but they moved away , and only Romain and her aunt remained behind . <p> The young girl gasped quietly in the dark . <p> " Wheres aunt Jennie ? " <p> " She went to a nearby town , and will only be back a week later . " <p> Sophie turned his head to glance at her . He only saw a pair of gleaming eyes filled with a strange excitement . <p> " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't  know , " She replied in a whisper , and raised her head : " But my heart is pounding , like its really excited . " <p> Sophie went speechless . Looks like there was quite a difference between this girl and a normal person . Well , some people were born for adventure , and maybe Romain was someone like that . <p> He pretended that he did not hear any of it and gazed outside the window again . The necromancer had not paid attention to their house yet , and Sophie was able to continue observing them without any worries . Shadows seemed to appear in and out of the forest , perhaps there a great number of invaders there . <p> He roughly estimated the initial force was slightly over a hundred . This was not a small number , and with such a force there must be an undead acolyte wizard commanding in the shadows . This was a news of dreadful proportions to him . <p> In the game , an undead acolyte wizard was roughly equivalent to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven or eight well trained male adults , be it militia or the army , they would not the match for it . Romain and himself were only two people , while that foe also had a large army behind him . <p> Sophie tapped his finger on the window impatiently . <p> The guards from Bucce would need at least 5 minutes , which meant if they encountered they had to hold on least that duration of time , with the condition they even discovered the attack in the first place . <p> But how were they supposed to alert them ? <p> He felt a little vexed . The best way was to set a fire , the bright flame and smoke would be able to reach far away in the night , and a natural warning to both humans and animals . But it was also a question on how to even set off a fire . <p> " Brendel ? Are we going to die ? " <p> " Uncertain . " <p> The dark room fell into a deep silence . <p> In this deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of the window and created a small silver colored path . <p> After pondering for a few moments , before he was about to set down the curtains down to settle his emotions down and think of a way to escape , they started talking . <p> " Where is that pitiful worms body , bring him out and let me take a look . Did n't  the report only stated there were were two women here ? " <p> This first voice sounded like a young man and his voice was cold and sharp . <p> The second voice sounded raspy and old , as though the dried firewood was cracking . <p> " He was merely an unfortunate fool , my master . " <p> Apprehension struck at Sophies heart , and he peered outside again , and quickly discovered the sources under a trees shadow . Over there , a figure wearing a broad black robe was talking to his necromancer underlings . <p> Sophies eyes quickly cast his eyes on his sleeves , and faintly saw a greyish white bone insignia . This proved that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not wrong . <p> " Know this , I do not need your opinions . All of you merely need to follow my orders . " The robed wizard suddenly stopped and raised his head to the Sophies direction . <p> Sophies heart pulsed with dread and immediately let go of the curtains . Damn it , he still thought he was a veteran warrior with 130 levels for a moment . He completely forgot that the enemys Perception was many times higher than his stealth skills . <p> Even though he was not immediately discovered , he must have raised the enemys suspicions . <p> Just as he had expected , that figure outside said : " Thats enough . Quickly carry out my orders . I feel that there is someone alive in this house . All of you better search carefully , I have the suspicion that our plans have already been discovered . " <p> This was the end of things . If they discovered Brendels corpse disappeared , they would immediately act upon it . Sophies mind spun quickly . His immediate thought was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was no place to hide in the open . <p> There was a small forest at the bottom of the hill , but there were at least a hundred meters of uncovered ground , what could he do in this situation ? <p> " Brendel ? " The girl queried him with her eyes . <p> " Come with me . " Sophie gritted his teeth . One step at a time , there was no choice to it . ( TL : If you want to live ! Lulz . ) <p> He opened the door , and saw a necromancer and two skeletons entering from the door . The necromancer that wore a long robe swiftly raised the bone wand when it discovered Romain and him . <p> But Sophies reaction was faster and he had no hesitation in raising in his right hand . He pointed his ring on his forefinger at it . <p> " Oss ! " <p> He prayed for the ring to work . And it answered his prayers with a slight warmth , and the air in front expanded violently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurricane swept past in the house , and the necromancer with the two skeletons and front of the entire building exploded in a fury . Countless splinters and pebbles along with bone debris were hurled outside , and fell raining down onto the ground like countless butterflies dancing in the air . <p> The instant when the explosion happened , five golden colored orbs flew respectively from the necromancer and skeletons bodies and dissolved in Sophies chest . Everything happened in the blink of an eye , and the youth did not even realize that himself . <p> Even after the explosive wind ended , the ground was left with the evidence of a colossal aftereffect of something firing from within . <p> After everything fell to a silent still , Sophie showed an expression of utter shock . In the game it was 30 wind damage , and certainly more than enough to kill a lower rank necromancer and the skeletons , but the effect was not that exaggerated right ? <p> Although it was a gaping hole in this whole building that was left behind by his grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promptly turned around and ran . <p> " Brendel , you 're a wizard ! " Romain exclaimed behind his back . <p> " No , I 'll explain this to you later . " He took a deep breath , pulled her and rushed down the stairs to head towards the kitchen . He needed to reach there before the enemies reacted . <p> " Wait , Brendel , I cant catch up with you .. " <p> " Careful , were moving down the stairs " <p> " Ah ! " <p> The sudden explosion made the skeletons turn their heads , but they lacked the intelligence to comprehend things and only reacted to the noise . Thus they still waited at the same spot and waited for the necromancers to give the orders . <p> The necromancers green flaming pupils flared up , and they raised their bone wands with embers forming at the tips . <p> " Do n't  use fire , you bloody fools ! " The black robed wizard pushed their bone wands down and rebuked them loudly . The explosion had most likely incurred the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would have merely sent a warning to them . <p> He immediately turned back to point to the house : " Soldiers , catch those two bastards ! " <p> The sounds of swords flourishing echoed out as the soldiers drew out their swords together and rushed inside to the house . <p> Sophie had already dashed down to the bottom of the steps and he saw waves of skeletons rushing towards him. - Uncountable red lights flickered in the darkness , and he felt goosebumps crawling all over his skins . He was not a veteran soldier with hundred of levels , and the ring on his finger was still in the recharging mode . He could only braced himself as to what would come next . <p> Once the skeletons caught up with him , he would most likely become minced meat from being hacked by their swords . <p> His injury in his chest hurt terribly , but they still managed to reach the kitchen before the skeleton soldiers , and closed the door behind him . Before he could even relax , multiple swords immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand quickly , otherwise he would have pinned down . <p> " That was too close for comfort ! " Sophies heart raced quickly . He looked around , and although at the other end of the kitchen was the exit , he knew he needed to find a way to warn Bucce . That was the only way to save their lives . <p> Furthermore , fire could be used to repel the low level undead . <p> " Brendel ? " The merchant girl bent her waist and panted . She could not help but raise her head to look at him . He had greatly surprised her with his decisive bravery . <p> " Miss Romain , please guard the door . " Sophie quickly said . He needed to spend every second to think . <p> " Kssh , kssh , kssh ! " <p> The soldiers started to break the kitchen wooden door . It was never meant to be used for a defence and very soon there were several opened holes on it <p> " Me ? " . She blinked . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " What are you going to do ? " The merchant girl asked curiously . <p> " I 'm going to try to think of a way to warn the people inside the village . This is Madaras undead grand army , we need to warn them . " Sophie tried to hard to calm down , and replied while he searched for flints . <p> Where was that thing that he recalled ? <p> " Okay , sure , I 'll do that . " Romain immediately went over to the door to defend Sophie . <p> " Will you be fine ? " <p> " Of course . " The young girl shook the masonry hammer in her hands and replied confidently : " I 'll do my best , since I 'll become a great merchant in the future ! " <p> " Sophie 's eyes quickly cast his eyes on his sleep " -&gt; sleeves " He did n't  guess wrongly " I would want to modify this too , sth like " His guess was n't wrong " , but I 'm not native English speaker and I respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible .

@@37042260 @6042260/ <h> Tale of Wuxia Review <p> Tale of wuxia review . The overall impression is I enjoyed the characters in the story , the gameplay is truly bad , plot is just okay , minigames are a terrible grind , the cultural aspects are overly verbose , and the overall presentation is passable . Music is pretty good too . <p> Do I recommend it ? Only to Wuxia fans in the strictest sense . I would n't recommend it to casual gamers . <p> Where should I begin <p> I guess it should be the history first and foremost . <p> Tale of Wuxia can be seen as a sequel of Jin Yong Qun Xia Chuan . Jin Yong is a guy , along with two other guys , sort of made Wuxia ( Martial arts + Heroes. ) real popular decades back . Imho , xianxia ( fantasy hero ) kinda evolved from wuxia . This game is actually a remake , as the concept had already been done like years ago . If I 'm not wrong the game was n't financially successful , and after one more game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Jin Yong Qun Xia Chuan describes the protagonist ( you ) , as a modern world dude who time-slipped into Jin Yongs world . He needs to retrieve Jin Yongs 14 different novels in order to go home . After resolving the different events in the novels , he battles the Ten Great Evil Persons ( Canon ) alone and won , which he then proceeds home . <p> Years later , the original developers came back as a company to remake it again . <p> Introduction to the term Wuxia : <p> Wuxia is supposed to be a hero who does good deeds and do all sort of things that relates to chinese ethics and moral codes , something like that . <p> Tale of Wuxia adheres to the genre , obviously . <p> Story Plot/Direction rating 5.5/10 <p> There is a litany of problems here . <p> The first problem is there 's so many lines of poetry talk . Its at the point where I think you need higher level chinese study in a real chinese university to even make sense of the text . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicative of the phrase 4000 years of chinese culture . I think its kind of interesting and boring at the same time ; you really have to have a passion for this sort of thing . <p> Now , do n't  get me wrong , I 'm seriously impressed with how complex it is , and it really shows the writer knows his stuff really well or that he researched really well . I lost count of how many types of Chinese wines are out there and what they drink them with different cups , like how you have different wine glasses for white/red wine . Different types of tea and how the quality of water affects them , ten over different chinese chess puzzles , about how chinese letters are written back then ( like 4-5 different prototypes of the original alphabet ) and their history . <p> Its classy enough to be recognized as a historical gem , but if you 're the typical casual/regular gamer , then its just too complicated , especially more so if you cant read chinese characters . Yet I feel that the writing does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are occasions where the protagonist explains a few answers here and there , most of the time it just leaves the reader to decipher the answer for themselves , and a casual search within the chinese community does n't  show the explanations either . <p> Moving on to the " main " storyline . <p> Now if you look at the above , the level of intricacy for the cultural aspects is really high . Does the main storyline compare ? Sadly , its a no . <p> To start off , the protagonist in Tale of Wuxia is a teenager who dreams of becoming The Hero , like another dude who became The Hero 100 years ago in another different game . He goes through the cycle- trusting certain people all too easily at their words , which in turn causes a situation that causes the villagers to hate him , before he resolves it . You should n't help the villains , says the villagers . <p> Generally that works well enough as a plot device , but the execution is n't that effective . <p> Imagine watching an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where its not exciting in the beginning and even slow because they need to introduce the characters , then the protagonist gets angry/upset because of a particular event and it becomes really exciting at the end . Its like the big clash between the good and evil , and the outcome is where you get a favorable outcome ( An example of such movies , The man from nowhere or Taken . ) . <p> There 's a ton of visual and sound intensity needed to compensate for the lack of plot when it comes to the action genre . Tale of Wuxia tries to do that with some in-game cutscenes , but in order to make it successful on a tired cliche , you need a variety of camera shots to express a full range of emotions . Tale of Wuxia comes off as a bit of a visual novel-type , but the character portraits consist only of 1 body shot illustration . <p> The only time where it uses a range of emotions is the Chibi like shots , which I feel that it takes even more away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be non-serious . <p> Voiced lines would have done wonders for that bland section . <p> Generally speaking , the main plot is okay in terms of writing . As far as I can see , nearly 90% of the plot is about you going through 4 years of nurturing your skills in a valley . I get to see bits and pieces about the Big Evil , but its only at the last year ( which is Year 4 ) , before everything explodes and a war is about to break out between the good and evil . I finally get to " explore " the world map , but about one hour later the story ends . <p> Really ? <p> In comparison , The prequel Jin Yong Qun Xia Chuan ( such a mouthful ) , plays out like a traditional isometric CRPG , somewhat like baldurs gate . It allows you to explore the world map without chucking you into a small place where you spent majority of the time there . While its true that it kind of reflects the life of a martial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this does n't  make up for good story material if you 're going to stay there in a small corner where middling events happen . <p> It also does n't  help that the pacing is completely off due to the format of the gameplay . You 're highly invested in getting good stats/skills , which takes quite a bit of time to think about how to ration your limited stamina . <p> Ultimately the main plot comes out with such a cookie-cutter format that it leaves me scratching my head . In some aspects I find the prequel to be even greater because of the way how it deals with the plot . It has 14 different scenarios where you get to solve the novels character conflicts , and a final conclusion of battling with ten final bosses . Tale of Wuxia gives you one general scenario where you resolve things in a few different ways at the end of the game . <p> Take note that this is merely about the plot and not about the roleplay . One can arguably say that Tale of Wuxia has very strong roleplay elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the prequel . <p> Characters 8.5/10 <p> The characters are designed really well and are varied in terms of personality . Interactions and lines between them are the best highlights of the game . <p> There are 10 girls + 2 DLC girls to pursue . The latest steam version of 1.0.2.6 ( free DLC already included ) has a conflict on the schedule for the DLC girls , which is later corrected in later patches ( not available on steam yet ) . Each of the girls have around 7 or 8 events , along with main mission events to gain affection . <p> I do like how the protagonist is straightforward and kinda dumb in the romance department , but he retains a strong quality of a Wuxia hero who does n't  get seduced by the bad girls and become anakin skywalker , although there are moments where you have to let a thief girl get away if you want to pursue her . <p> All in all , its really quite sweet and even downright cool by throwing away social norms ( Yaksha DLC route ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aging though . <p> The bro factor is done quite well too , although I must say I wish that I get more bro scenes . There was one scene where the protagonist is being dumb enough to get deceived by a con-girl , and his bro tried to soften the blow by acting dumb as well . Said protagonist suddenly took a level up in observational skills and calls him out on him . I chose the " You lied to me too , you bloody bastard ! " option instead of the " You were just trying to cheer me up " option , which caused our relationship points to drop . <p> I kind of wish there was a follow-up scene that the developer puts in so that either one of us apologizes , because that 's how much I cared about being a bro . There are nice other moments , like how the senior-sect bro turned to the dark side and the protagonist risks his life to save him . <p> Out of everything in the game , I liked this aspect the most . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frankly outdated . I know its supposed to be a nostalgic game for the chinese gamers , but man , that 's not something I enjoyed even remotely . Its a horrific grind to get the materials you want so you can craft the items you want , which again is another mini game . <p> There are so many stats that it nearly makes it look really complex and impressive , but then you realize that its really quite silly because its just a multiplier damage OR restriction to learn a particular skillset . You want to punch people ? Well let 's up your punching skills . You want to stab people with a sword ? Let 's up your sword skills . Ad nauseam . <p> The most ridiculous thing and greatest restriction is the cooldown on movesets that occurs if you switch different skill sets . Are you fing kidding me ? This is the biggest letdown , ever . So if you learn a particular skill , say Solar Finger , you get two different movesets on it . The basic skill has no cooldown if you switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets slapped with a cooldown , of like 3-4 turns . <p> That 's the absolute worst gameplay decision ever made . I mean , you could give the excuse like you need maybe need the " Martial art knowledge " to reduce the cooldown , but nope , its a damage multiplier and you cant reduce the cooldown whatsoever for any movesets . <p> The thing with movesets is how they boost you up with different kind of status boost . It might be multipliers for critical chance , accuracy , attack damage , etc , etc . It will really make one feel like you 're a martial god if you can rotate all these combination moveset skills . The developer could have linked cooldowns with related skill profiency and that would have boosted the complexity of the game immensely . <p> If you cant swap the different skillsets , what is the point of learning twenty different skills only to just keep using one skillset ? <p> UI is also terrible in keeping track of the stats . Instead of letting you read the stats that increase , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like they are n't  important . Given the above criticism that I wrote , I can agree that its not important at all , but it still annoys me to no end when I miss the text of what stats increased . Even worse is how the aftermath of each battle is resolved . There 's a hidden XP somewhere in the skillset . Each time you use your skill or defeat an enemy , its my belief that it increases in XP and will even level up even in the middle of a battle . <p> That is NOT shown at all . Even the prequel bothered to show it in text that your skill level has increased . <p> Item management is a clunky mess . I do n't  see any options to rearrange it . There 's no world map/map and there does n't  seem to be a quest log management as well . <p> That 's not the end of it , however . I also feel that the game is not balanced accordingly in regards to the damage calculation , but I did n't  really go deep enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Most of the time you 're going to pick icons to train or find events , and not walk around in a map to explore things , which will be boring after realizing that you 're going to do this for 75% of the game . <p> Roleplay ? /10 <p> The thing about roleplay is that its highly personal . I personally enjoyed having the girls calling me my online name and it is really quite gleeful . I would say 9/10 , but your mileage might vary . <p> Regarding the stats development , I 'll say that its more important if the gameplay actually mattered . At present its a " pick a skill tree and stick with it " , otherwise you 're going to suffer . <p> Graphics 8/10 <p> This is one of the best looking Unity game Ive seen . It tries to merge a variety of art choices into one , and for the most part its fine for what it is . The only criticism I have is the want for better 3D cutscenes and more 2D body portrait shots . <p> Music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets for the budget it has . There 's even a small cutscene of someone singing . <p> There are also a number of short voiced lines that even has a number of dialects for different characters if you right click in battle . I chuckled when I listen to Tang Sects disciples talking . Its all very garbled and mouthful , leading to subtle situations . <p> The people who did this area did it really well . <p> Overall score 6.5/10 <p> I really want to say that Tale of Wuxia is a great game , but its not . However , if you want an English Wuxia experience from a game , I think its the closest experience you 're going to get . <p> No , I 'm not really interested with the gameplay of Tale of Wuxia , and I doubt the prequel will differ that much . Also , the story is about the protagonists seniors instead of a new protagonist , so that 's even more boring for me.

Donated chapter . <p> Chapter 98 Fallen ( 3 ) <p> The Disciples of the Black Flames were actively searching in the forest for their enemies , which meant that Brendels group could encounter them any time . <p> There 's no need to be too worried about encountering any boss fights . The disciples are probably searching for Makarov and Buga , while the only trouble we should encounter are the Lizardmen . This battle ca n't be avoided , otherwise there would be trouble later on if I do n't  clear them as soon as possible . <p> The entire quest was a trap . A few of the government officials were bribed by the Tree Shepherds and the Tree Shepherds simply waited for Makarov to fall into their trap , which he did . However , Makarov deserved his fame and managed to send Eke out safely just with his instincts . <p> Brendel did not care about what was going to happen to them .

In the game , the group of gamers were completely wiped out when Conrad appeared to battle Makarov , which then led to Makarov and Bugas escape by sacrificing both the Grey Wolves Mercenaries and the gamers . <p> If the situation continued to the point where the gamers did not die , Brendel speculated that the Tree Shepherds next move was to give orders to the Lizardmen Bandits and search for his group . Once Makarov and Buga were out of the forest , then the Tree Shepherds attention would turn back to his group . <p> Brendel needed to vanquish the Lizardmen before he was surrounded by the enemies . Once the Lizardmen had the Tree Shepherd leading them , he was not sure whether he would be able to handle his enemies . <p> At this point of time , the Lizardmen were nothing more than a mob of monsters .

It was common sense for them to act in that manner , but the Mercenaries of Lopes were angered by them because they had never been slighted before . <p> The Nightsong Tiger frowned at them as he cast glances at the Silver Elves . He knew how terrifying they were so he did not wish to talk about them . <p> " My lord , I 'm sure that its another card within the Eversong series " He spoke patiently in his mind . <p> " Yes , yes , yes , " Brendel interrupted him inside his mind : " You already told me that six times already .

" <p> The Nightsong Tiger smiled while shaking his head . He knew that point very well , but his lord looked as if he did not care about these important things . The more powerful the Planeswalker was , the stronger the summons would be , but Brendel did not want to listen about it . Even though he kept hinting to Brendel that he should focus to train as a Planeswalker and gather Cards , the latter simply continued doing what he wanted to do without changing his plans at all . <p> The Nightsong Tiger had seen many things in his days but he was unable to guess what Brendels plans were . <p> Does he want to become a lord of a region ? But this is quite meaningless for a Planeswalker , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A mortal might be interested in gaining authority , but the ultimate goals for a Planeswalker are to discover the truth of this world and seek a higher path of power . Is there anything in the mortal world that is more attractive than that ? The Nightsong Tiger scratched his beard . <p> Certainly , the thing that he did not understand about Brendel was his greed for items . The latter was practically drooling for items that might not even exist . As a hardcore gamer , there would be no way for him to escape from the idea of killing and looting a BOSS . <p> When the youth nearly fell into a state of delirious giggling , someone patted his back . <p> The shock was extraordinary . He jumped up a little and whipped his head to the back to a shining golden helmet and a pair of silver-grey eyes . <p> The Elven commander . Gosh , fucking hell bro , do you even make any noises when you move ? <p> Brendel recognized him in an instant , before cursing at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " What 's wrong ? " <p> The Silver Elves were formidable because of their abilities and equipment , and not known for their subterfuge . Brendel was frightened because he did not pay attention to his surroundings in the slightest . <p> The Elven commander did not feel guilty for scaring him , and did not show any expressions at all . He merely pointed to a direction and said quietly : " A group of people is escaping and moving to our location . " <p> " Escaping ? " Brendel paused for a moment as he noticed the word the Elven Commander used . <p> Whos escaping in this direction ? Bugas men should be in the south . Was there anything in the guide that said otherwise or did the gamers miss out something relevant ? <p> The Elven commanders gaze went back to Brendel , as though there was a slight dissatisfaction to Brendels questioning tone , but the latter nodded . <p> Brendel knew that this blockhead-like fellow would not be joking with him . He even wondered if the Elven commander had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he quickly raised his hand to signal for his group to stop . <p> The sleepy Amandina and Romaine were jolted when the mercenaries immediately stopped upon Brendels signal , and the merchant girl asked in curiosity : " What 's wrong Brendel ?

Their chaotic footsteps seemed like they were in great disarray , and he could understand why the Elven commander said they were running away . <p> Amazing . As expected of someone who 's a high level NPC , this level of alertness is n't something a normal person would have . <p> He had seen many gamers playing like they were tourists in another country , hardly fitting for the brewing wars in Aouine . However , their given abilities were strong enough to fend off ambushes , so that was perhaps why they did acted like tourists . <p> He listened carefully once more , and detected another source of troops who had mounts pursuing them . His expression became solemn . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lizardmen with their traditional Riding Lizard mounts , the other was the Disciples of the Black Flames and their demons . <p> Warhorses did not fare well in the forest , especially in this mountainous region , but he still thought it as a third distant possibility . He then signaled for everyone to fall into formation and prepare for battle . <p> Very soon , the panicking people who were trying to escape entered his eyes . There were six of them , males and females split equally into half , and their clothes were tattered and torn like refugees . They had numerous wounds but they did not throw away their weapons , indicating that they still had the willpower to fight .

The reason why I tl TSTBGAM is mainly because I wanted something to distract myself from TAS serious plotline . In the past TAS took just slightly more than 3 hours , because I did n't  really need to worry about the format of the skill names or search for continuity checks . <p> However , like I have explained a while ago , the time to TL has gone up . Not only do I have to make the sure the action scenes are making sense , I have to check the skill names in the past and ( future ) to make sure there 's no TL errors , squash redundancy lines and format stats descriptions .

Note on PROBABLY , so do n't  get excited . <p> In the mean time , I want to TL a R18 JP series ( the series is probably targeted towards the female audience ? Havent really read it ) that 's going to replace TSTBGAM . If I 'm going to spend 7-8 hours to TL then I 'll want to do to improve my kanji dictionary instead . <p> How long will the hiatus be ?

Next regular update will be on next wednesday . <p> Chapter 109 Looting the body and an accident <p> " Mana Arrow ! " The Dark Bishop screeched as he launched it towards Brendel . <p> Brendel clenched his teeth and evaded the arrow by twisting his body , letting it slide across his chest . The hellfire scorched his skin and he felt like his whole body was set ablazed . Even though there was damage done , the outcome was much better than having a few of his ribs broken . <p> Damn it . Even though I was on my guard against the Dark Bishops Cast Invisibility spell , I still got damaged . <p> In the game , the tanking professions would usually take this damage , but Brendel was certain that he would not get caught by it with his reactions and was not disappointed by his agility . <p> If he failed to evade it , then the next few attacks would be a set of combination spells from the Dark Bishop . He would not get killed by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But this is the only time where I can get full solo XP , since the Nightsong Tiger and the others will probably rush to help me out . In any case , now that the Dark Bishop has failed , its going to be my turn for a counter-attack . <p> Brendel leapt and immediately got behind the Dark Bishopss back with another swing of his sword . <p> As he expected , the Dark Bishop flung his arm in an arc and allowed the black shield to intercept Brendels sword , while a pile of black flames appeared on his left hand again . <p> Although my attack only took 1/3 of the durability away , do you really think I cant break your Shield of Darkness that only has 10 points ? <p> Brendel scoffed as he jumped backwards to avoid the second Mana Arrow . There was no need to be impatient . <p> The exchange of attacks took place during Brendels Charge ability . The Lizardmen realized their target had disappeared , and paused for a moment blankly before they started to search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him attacking the Dark Bishop with a sword that was shining brightly <p> He had called out the Stats Window during his retreat , and raised Frontal Assault to level five . At that level the defenses would be weakened by 10 OZ , and was effectively the bane of warriors who wore Heavy Armor as well as wizards with high level barriers . <p> Brendels sword started to vibrate intensely as the blade reflected the moonlight , and making it seem like it was clad with light . <p> The sword went in a straight line . <p> Power Break , Frontal Assault , activate ! Brendel felt as though all his strength leaving his body and poured into the thrust . <p> The results did not disappoint him . The Dark Bishop stared at his shield which was breaking into a shower of fragments in great disbelief . That ordinary looking sword emerged past his abdomen and back without stopping , and once it did so , Brendel immediately released his sword and went behind his back . <p> When he did so , the Dark Bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his eyes , nostrils , mouth and injuries . The strength of the flames which were more than ten times stronger than the Mana Arrow , caused Brendel who went behind his back to feel the Dark Element boiling in the sky and made his skin prick painfully . <p> Burning life points and converting them into Mana . This was the last defense of any Elementalist . It could be used instantly , but only someone like the Dark Bishop was insane enough to use every bit of his life force to kill Brendel along with himself . <p> Brendel had suffered this suicidal move in the past so he made sure to avoid it . If he took that head on , he was most likely going to be dead or at the very least near death . <p> That well made Whitesteel Longsword was probably destroyed . Unless it was a magic artifact , most of the normal artifacts would be destroyed from the Mana Explosion . He was not even sure if there was anything going to be left from it . <p> He then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to surround him . <p> He felt that his smile was quite sincere and friendly , but the Lizardmen looked at him like he as though he was a horrifying monster . Even someone as strong as the Dark Bishop was killed by the youth in an instant , while they were just insignificant minions who would not make a difference in this battle . They could not help but look at each other with doubt , then quickly turned around and ran away . <p> They were able to relish that the fact that the youth did not go after them . The truth was Brendel was actually in a weakened state . The combination of Power Break and Frontal Assault had used up fifteen times the Stamina required to use a full swing . Even though he still had stamina remaining he felt quite exhausted . <p> Whatever . This battle is at its end anyway . Let 's see . I got 4200 points from the Dark Bishop , and my current XP is 5645/13600 , oh , its still going up huh <p> He looked up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and chased them to paths that were narrow and complicated . When the Dark Bishop died , the Lizardmen were unable to form any resistance any longer and started to flee . <p> In the beginning , there were still some resemblance of a defensive formation , but it quickly descended into a chaotic retreat . <p> The only thing left to do in this battle was to just wait for the XP to come in . <p> Brendel went ahead and sat beside the Dark Bishop without touching anything . Since he was unlucky in finding good loot from the bodies , he wanted to wait for the older Elementalist sister to handle the corpse . <p> He took out a Moonlight Crystal out , activated it and threw it up into the air . This was the signal to inform the mercenaries they no longer needed to support the battle with ranged attacks , and they should regroup with him . <p> Since it was boring to wait for them , Brendel started to study his stats . <p> Strength and Physique are over 25 oz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've definitely reached the minimum qualification for a Silver-rank fighter . Adding my other abilities like Power Break and Frontal Assault will allow me to reach the top tier fighters of this rank . <p> " Thats two months . Do you believe that , old pal ? You turned from a common militia to the level of an Apprentice Knight with the strength of a Silver-rank fighter . Even the formal Bucce guards cant even compare to you now . Trust me when I say our road is still far ahead- " Brendel smiled a little as he placed his hand over his chest and muttered . The Brendel from the game world felt a surge of emotions within him . It was true that level 25 was really nothing to him . <p> The mercenaries made their way down from the forest , and the former Grey Wolves Mercenaries were especially excited . They knew very little about their new lord compared to the others . Even though Brendel said he would bring them victory , they did not realize that it would be won so easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven times , and there were Silver-ranked demons and the Dark Bishop who constantly hounded them in the past like an unending nightmare . Sanford was still a little agitated when he ran to Brendels side , and he suddenly felt there was something different about his lord , and caused him to forget his manners . He approached close to him and asked excitedly : " My lord , did you break your limits ? " <p> Brendel nodded . <p> " The lord is only twenty years old , and he attained the might of a Silver-rank fighter , " The Grey Wolves Mercenaries looked at each other and murmured amongst themselves . " We are fortunate enough to witness the birth of two prodigies . " <p> " Two ? " Brendel said . <p> " The member within our former Grey Wolves Mercenaries . His name is Eke . " Sanford replied . <p> " So its him . " Brendel raised his eyebrow . He was not really concerned with that name , so he quickly looked for that person amongst the mercenaries , spotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that direction : " Over here , lucky babe , come over here and loot this body ! " <p> Everyone stopped talking when they heard him <p> They first looked at where Brendel was looking at , hesitated for a while , before putting their eyes on the older Elementalist sister . She looked at the people around her before pointing at herself : " Me ? " <p> " Yeah , did n't  I ask you before to do this task ? " Brendel pointed at the Dark Bishop : " Loot the body . No , I mean , tidy up the victory items . " <p> The girls pretty looking brows frowned as she bit her lower lips , while she glared at Brendel : " My lord , my name is Felaern , and not l-lucky babe ! " Her heavily accented tongue caused her to nearly bite her tongue . She was looking coldly at him as she thought he was trying to cause trouble for her . <p> " My lord , I have also been to Karsuk , but the locals have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from the side . <p> " No , this talk is between us wizards . " Brendels recovery was very quick . <p> " What does it mean ? " <p> " It means that the persons luck is very good , very moe , and a totally hot girl . " <p> Even though the Elementalist sister did not know what moe meant , she understood there were some i 'll intentions somewhere . She glared at her lord as she confirmed in her heart that all human males were certainly lustful beasts . However , she was a subordinate to him , so she did not make any disrespectful actions , nodded and did what she was ordered to . <p> Suddenly there was a series of soft bangs in the east hills . At first the sounds continued with low rumbles , before clear cracking sounds mixed with thunder-like booms could be heard . The ground where they were standing trembled . <p> Brendel looked at the pebbles at his feet which moved like they were dancing . <p> Why are these sounds so familiar . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Come to think of it , I have n't heard these sounds in the game for decades . How nostalgic Wait , what ? ! <p> Brendels expression changed and immediately looked up . Indeed , the cliffs in the east were being destroyed in a pile of rising dust clouds . <p> Everyone stared with gaping mouths as they watched the rocks fly everywhere <p> Not sure this statement is just me talking or if it may help you ; but , you can make a spread sheet with terms you translated . You have one column with the original translation , next with the words you translated it to , what chapter it appears in . Then when you see some move a character does and you think its similiar you check your spread sheet to keep consistency . You want to change the word to a new translation you can see the chapter it was on to easily edit past chapters . <p> I am little confused with level UP ! AS i understand character level = summary of all profession levels . So if he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exp and level up commoner , it is cheap because it is still low level on this profession ! <p> And where is 2nd unique skill when he reached level 25 ? I do n't  think it is frontal assault ! AS i understand from 2 skills which he mentioned/planed to take , the one with status bust + profession penalty reduction is the best now ! <p> And now and in future when saying LVL UP and showing how much needed till next level , author only means about Mercenary profession ? <p> Oh boy , proofreading . I spend quite a bit of time trying to find out if they are any errors , but I cant confirm because there really is n't any direct information on it lol . All the author does is kind of hint at stuff , probably because there 's no need for him to fact check his stuff so he can write faster . <p> I guess I can give you my theories though and a refreshment course . <p> His current Mercenary level is level 18 . <p> Brendels current overall level is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> He received the ability Frontal Assault not because he reached Character level 25 , but because he reached Mercenary level 18 . <p> He has n't  taken his second unique ability . <p> Since he can only reach a maximum of overall character level 160 , he s careful to save XP and not spend too much on any professions . <p> Also Commoner level is maxed out at level 1 . He ca n't level up commoner . <p> He can level up his militia profession ( horrific stats growth ) , but why would he do so ? He s already skimping on the Mercenary profession because he does n't  like the stats growth on this profession . <p> Multi-classing has an XP penalty . The fact that he has the Commoner and Militia classes , means that he s already suffering from poor stats growth as well as class penalty . <p> Brendels profession in the game was a pure warrior-related class that 's over level 130 . <p> His current body in the world is a plain NPC body , which is worse than his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgot alchemy profession ! ? As for multi profession penalty , we still do n't  know what it is ! There was only said about skills , you can get them , but it you do n't  have any profession which related to this skill , then you need appoint this skill to any of existing professions and point required to get skill level up will be twice more ! As for body stats , there was said only that different professions gives different stats ( and their amount ) per lvl ! Look at Militia and Mercenary , they cost different amount of points to lvl up , but also give different amount of stats per lvl ! <p> In game there is cap lvl , but in real NO ! so he could lvl up militia to 10 to get additional stat bonuses wasting only small amount of XP ! <p> I think you missed some of the information . The alchemy profession is a secondary non-combat profession that does not count towards levels . <p> Your grammar is too broken for me to understand if you 're mistaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributed across all main ( combat ) professions , both in the real world and the game world . Brendel will never level up his militia profession because its an utter waste of levels to do so . Where did you get the idea that there 's no cap in the real world ? <p> Multi profession penalty is XP requirement to increase a level ( I 'm not sure if there are any other associated penalties which is why I did n't  write it in ) . I think there 's a bit of early talk in the story about the gamers taking on many professions , gaining an early Stats advantage which only came back to bite them at the end because the XP requirement went up and there was no real stats advantage at the end of the game .

Know this Batum , humans would seek to grasp at the wheat offered to them during desperate times , but they would not hold on to them every single moment .

He had observed Brendel for quite some time from the sides , and knew that his ambition was big , so he wanted to aid him by going for moves that aided in growing his power . <p> But Brendels current concern was not about power , it was about the Unifying Guild .

Batum on the other hand looked like he had found home . A mercenary like him was a frequent patron of this place , where there were sleazy bounty hunters , thieves , illegal merchants as well as low level prostitutes . It was as if this place had the stench of evil and sin . <p> But within this place , there were also scenes where people treated others sincerely . <p> Brendel was not able to criticize this place , and he did not want to anyway .

Dust could be seen scattering from the door as well . <p> Batum frowned when he looked at this place . <p> " I can hardly imagine there is anyone living in this place . I have seen many poor peoples dwelling , but I have never seen a place like this that 's so dilapidated .

He looked at the balding old man who chuckled in a low voice twice , before looking at the two of them with his cloudy green eyes again . <p> " What brings you here , Brendel ? Have you gotten rich ? Or have you sent me a new customer ? " <p> The previous Brendel had pawned several of his personal things at Roens place and therefore became linked to this malicious person . But what he did not understand was how Roen came to know about the painting in his old grandfathers house . <p> Brendel glared at him with an intense expression , and the cripple recoiled backwards . <p> " You . seem to be a little different , Brendel .

Tell me if my grandfathers painting was stolen by your men . " Brendel glared at him as if he was going to kill him right away . <p> Batum turned back and saw several men flinching when they noticed his face . He picked up several rocks and hit them squarely , causing them to squeal in pain and run away , before he gestured to Brendel to inform him he was going to go after them . <p> Roen lost his confidence when he saw this scene unfold before his eyes , and he immediately shouted in a shrill voice : " Brendel , please listen to me , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offend .

He could not kill him here so he pulled back his sword with disappointment . <p> " Another deal ? Brendel , I might not be able to receive your deals if they are of the same nature .

The monster gurgled as the the orange flames shimmered ; it was clearly displeased with the cavaliers flippant attitude . <p> " Its not your place to lecture me , small one . " <p> The monsters voice was raspy and broken , like a clockwork mechanism that had not been maintained . <p> It straightened its body and threw the corpse down from a cliff .

He found one of his cards on the floor . WHen he turned it over , he saw the Wind Spider Spirits had turned grey , an indication that it had entered into the Graveyard . <p> His first reaction was not to mourn for the loss of it but quickly kept it into his pocket and extinguished his lamp , causing his surroundings turned dark immediately . <p> That 's too fast . <p> Brendel felt like he was slightly caught off guard . <p> The Grey Wolves Mercenaries had selected an ideal vale to avoid the winds and constructed tents there . Brendel suggested their forces to be situated further from each other to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they happily agreed . Brendel did not trust them , and they did not trust him either , thus the two scheming parties found this arrangement to be agreeable . <p> What Makarov did not expect was why Brendel wanted this arrangement ; it was just so that he could run away in the middle of the night with an excuse . <p> The youth crawled out of his tent and immediately felt the hair on his bare skin stand up . Chablis was mired in deep fog in its area , and had high temperature during the day time with the temperature falling quickly in the night . Unprepared travelers would certainly find themselves to be chilled if they did not prepare adequate bedding . <p> Brendel shook off any intention to sleep and observed his surroundings .

He was already dressed and ready for full combat . He wore a set of studded leather armor , with pouches attached to his belt as well as a longsword .

After a few seconds , a curious voice came from within : <p> " Brendel ? " <p> " Romaine , why are you in here ! " Brendel felt confounded as he had checked repeatedly that it was supposed to be Amandinas tent . <p> " Its a surprise ! " She giggled with a little pride . <p> " Cut your bloody surprises . " Brendel growled . <p> Someone emerged from the tent , and he saw Amandina tying her hair while she stood up . She had an apologetic face , but Brendel knew that Romaine would have ignored her protests . He gave an audible sigh and apologized to her . <p> " I 'm sorry for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brendels apology to register in her mind , then smiled faintly as she glanced at her tent . <p> " My lord , it seems that you are really fond of Romaine .

He allowed Romaine to do whatever she wanted , was not only because lesser half of him had spent his life with her as a friend , but also because the greater half of him acknowledged her as the first friend that he had when came to this world . <p> Unfortunately , that naive and shy youth is no longer here . This body might be nineteen in this world but I 'm certainly not of that age . what I want to attain here will demand an equivalent amount of responsibilities . <p> He pulled back the corner of the tents opening , and found Romaine beaming at him . <p> " Are you both ready ?

This specific Card summoned beings seemed to represent a certain collective nature , and these twelve mercenaries were the best representation of Heroic , Loyalty , Honor , Morale , and Discipline . They also did not fear death and pain , and were most likely to be the best soldiers that graced this world . <p> Brendel wanted more men like them . <p> The more Amandina watched them , the more impressed she was . She quickly felt her face , then looked at Brendel , wondering whether she was seeing things wrongly- <p> It was not as if she had not seen mercenaries before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect their properties . Most of the mercenaries were related to the kingdoms formal army , if they exclude the local bullies and criminals . <p> She thought she had seen the best of them when she traveled with the Grey WOlves Mercenaries , but Brendels men clearly distinguished themselves beyond reproach . They seemed to exude something that a normal mercenary would never have <p> She showed a slight frown as she tried to find the words to describe them . <p> Pride and dignity . How many mercenaries would maintain what they do like it was some form of sacred duty , like a knights oath ? These men does n't  look like they could be paid with coins , but more like they are retainers from a nobles family . <p> The more she thought about it , the more she believed in her supposition . <p> A nobles scion leaving his own family to create his own fiefdom .

It is better for him to be prepared , rather than someone who 's a hot-blooded knight who wants to imitate the legendary figures of old . <p> Brendel did not know what Amandina was thinking about from his single Cards of Fate . If he knew , he would have tried ways to show off his mercenaries and recruit loyal retainers . <p> When the twelve men were done with their packing and had gathered before him for his next order , Brendel found he had encountered a small problem . <p> Two people , a man and a woman , from the Grey Wolves Mercenaries camps were heading over to his camp area . <p> He squinted and identified one of them <p> Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of commotion here No , these two are clearly not heading for our tents .

She took a look at the Ponoas market area . Even though it was morning , there were a decent amount of people in this place . Torches were lit everywhere , and the brightness more or less made people feel safe <p> She prepared to move , but Sue suddenly grabbed her arm : " Stop , there 's someone hidden in the alley .

" Sue shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clenched fist to her lips , pondering anxiously . If they appeared in the Ponoa market now , they were most likely the soldiers of the White-Mane army . <p> Brendel have predicted this would happen . They really went to find hood . Have they talked to him ? Should I still continue to meet with him ? Freya furrowed her brows . <p> Wait , Brendel said that it was okay even if I discovered the soldiers . Without knowing our relationship , they wont act immediately as they want to capture all of us . <p> Freya took a deep breath . She turned her head and asked : " Sue , can you answer me a question ? " <p> " What is it ? " <p> " How do you know when someone is lying ? " <p> The dark-skinned girl laughed : " Did you ask this question because I help out at the bar ? " <p> Freya flushed a little , she was indeed eyeing Sues vastly superior experience compared to hers . Most of the citizens and her naively thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Sue pointed out the truth within a couple of lines during their conversation . <p> In Freyas heart , this slightly cold girl was very sharp and assertive . <p> " No problem . I help people everyone out once in a while , " Sue smiled : " Freya , look at me . " <p> " Huh ? " <p> " Your friend that says that Fortress Riedon will be conquered , what is his name ? " <p> Freya was momentarily taken aback as she did not know why she asked this question . She panicked a little in her heart , and her eyes darted about : " B-Brendel . " <p> Sues eyes glinted : " You like him , right ? " <p> " N-no , Brendel , he , likes Romaine . " <p> " Eyes , Freya , look at me .

" Freya lowered her head , while nodding hard . <p> She took another deep breath to calm herself , her fingers on the swords hilt and ready to move out , but she suddenly turned back and grabbed Sues arm . " Sue , can you wait for me for a while ? " <p> Sue paused for a while , but she nodded her head . Freya felt a little mystified by her actions , but she kept feeling Sue was like Brendel , and it gave her a little more confidence . <p> She walked out of the alley and acted like there was no one around her and did not pay attention to her surroundings , like she always came to Ponoas number 51 . She hesitated a little when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly knocked on the door . <p> The bangs on the door felt like they came from her heart . Freya waited for a while and the door opened with a creak , showing a man who was hunched over and bald , and it was difficult to ascertain his age . When he saw Freya , he stopped moving for an instant , then retreated a step back as he recognized her . <p> ( Freya , look at me . ) <p> Freya noted the miniscule change in his expression . A somber , icy feeling rose from her heart . <p> Brendel said I should note his reactions and decide <p> " Who are you , what is your matter with me ? " The hunched man asked after a while . Freya stood there in silence for a minute , and stared him coldly . Just when the man wanted to retreat , she suddenly pulled out her sword with a singing flourish and placed it on his neck . <p> At that moment where the unexpected happened , Sue saw a few people on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were doing . Their actions were subtle , but the girl hiding in the alley saw everything . <p> Freya did not know what happened behind her at all . She merely tried to hold her sword calmly and spoke steadily : " Are you the witchs ally ? " <p> " Do n't  kill me , they forced , for , witch ? " The hunched man was terrified over the sudden change , fell onto his butt , before finally understood what the stoic girl said . <p> Ciel also said something about her Romaines aunt having to do something with witches I did n't  think I was able to come up with something Her mind was actually blank when she drew out her sword . She continued to speak : " Her name should be Jennie , but never mind It does n't  matter since it seems I need to give you a lesson first . " <p> She raised her sword as she spoke , and Hood immediately shrieked in pitiful sobs : " Wait , wait , ser , I-I have nothing to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm not her ally or anything , I 'm just a relative to her , no , no , I mean distant relative ! " <p> " Oh ? " <p> " Its true , its true ! Please believe me , believe me , she 's just an occult who comes to the fortress occasionally to buy stuff ! And she just buys some weird things ! She lives with her niece in Bucce ! " <p> Freya glared at the man while repressing her hate for him . She hoisted him up in the air : " But my informant told me that she entered the city a few days ago . You better not be lying , as a. wizard , I can rip out your memories ! " <p> Hood was delirious from the sword on his neck , and could not pick out what was wrong with Freyas words : " I 'll tell you , I 'll tell you everything ! She left two days ago and went to the north of here . " <p> Freya looked at his eyes and threw him away in disgust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Damn it .

( TL : Google Ringlets , kind of hard to explain . ) <p> If she was in Brendels era , no matter if its a NPC or player , they would call her the Regent Princess . If there was anyone who could compare to the fame of the Goddess of War , it would be her , except her age was a little tender now . ( TL : Regent = a person appointed to administer a state because the monarch is a minor or is absent or incapacitated . ) <p> " The little girl is quite smart .

He knew that she was not simple and could not casually end things , especially when she was the kings favorite . <p> This time he borrowed the family name of Lais Bruman Dunn to go to Fortress Riedon as a antiquarian . The two men were similar because they loved to collect antiques . Even though they were quite different in appearance , there was not too much of a problem because not many could identify him .

I kind of had to check things up because things are becoming complicated and wanted to make sure for sure . I 'm like , what ? has the earl has come back to life ? , and who is that daughter , exactly , yup . ) <p> The girl before him obviously knew what he wanted to say , but did not pursue it . She merely asked another question : " But Lord Oberbeck , I am puzzled about your story . Its strange that you created trouble for that young man . " <p> Oberbecks mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still replied politely : " I was merely worried about his actions .

Since that person is only my double , I thought it was more important to make sure of the Karsuks knights intentions . I will even do it myself for the sake of the king . " Oberbeck answered <p> ( TL : Okay , so in case its not clear enough . The real Dunn went along with fake Dunn , ordered him to test out Brendels intentions , Fake Dunn died , Real Dunn went back and is speaking to the princess .

She wanted to hint something to Oberbeck , then stopped herself as she thought of her current status . <p> Finally she changed the topic : " What happened next Lord Oberbeck ? I wish to listen to the story next . I still have a couple of hours before my history lesson starts . " <p> " It would be my pleasure .

I think its going to think a few more chapters before Brendels coming back to rejoin the girls though . <p> I 'm kind of lost , does the writer keep switching " timelines " or " points of view " ? I do n't  really have a good indication whether they 're telling three different stories or the same story from three different points of view . <p> The culprit is a woman and if they intervene the authories will believe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the culprit . That is if the authorities would get there before your local white knights intervene in behalf of the " damsel in distress " . <p> There is this social experiment where there are to scenario , one is the woman is attacking the man and other scenario is that the man hiting a woman . Guess which one scenario people quickly intervene . <p> Except that in this case , the " authorities " are corrupted beyond measure , and would probably prefer to detain the woman , so that they can have their ways with her later . The actual knights worthy of the name are nigh nonexistent in that place . <p> Anyways I do n't  really get the ending . So Freya the daughter of him ?

Even though he felt that the mysterious rock was the most suspicious , he suddenly remembered that it was after he used the scroll , that he entered this dark world . <p> The scroll itself has the legitimate watermark created by the fairies , so it is not the scroll itself . But the activation of this spell , it is the unlocking of my Elemental Pool . Then this link . The Cards of Fate . Because I saw them as techniques and not items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think about it , these cards are more and more suspicious . <p> The cards had never appeared in the game . Brendel thought that it was incredibly strange that a whole series of cards had not been heard by anyone . <p> Its possible that one might not have heard of one of the card names , like the Wind Spider Spirit card , but not hearing of the deck itself ? That 's like saying you have never heard of what a magician wears for equipment . And the exceptional freedom of these cards actually allows a warrior like myself to use magic freely . You can even say that these cards is an entirely new profession . Its not like these cards appear only in Madara , it appeared in the city that I am most familiar with . <p> The tomb of Gerald , The valley of the Golden Demonic Tree , Fortress Riedon , Bruglas . I have been in these area for a long time , and I can even remember all the rumors for the first three years inside the game . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I allow myself not to think about these cards ? <p> Brendel did not realize that he was in grave peril when he found the cards , and like so many people , concentrated at surviving first . Brendels fingers felt to his pocket . <p> If this is a whole new profession . <p> " You mean a Planeswalker is ? " <p> " You have guessed correctly , the Cards of Fate are related to a Planeswalker . " <p> Brendel immediately stopped talking , because he knew that the young Tulman before him was going to explain everything . <p> " I need to clear one misunderstanding . These Cards of Fate are not created by me . You should have guessed by now , but they are even older than what we know in history . " Tulman brought his hand out and flipped it over . A card was on his palm , but it was facing down . Complicated sigils were drawn on top of it . <p> " If you take a look at the patterns here , you would find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with my little understanding , and passed down what I knew to the humans , elves and the Mirrna people . " <p> " Hold on , " Tulman raised his hand up and stopped Brendel from interrupting him : " I know what you want to ask . Why is it that I 'm obviously the descendant from the Mirrna and Basett blood , and an eternal enemy of the light , help the humans and elves ? " <p> He laughed : " Its very simple . As a Planeswalker , the problems and solutions that I see were different from others . I was all to young when I got these cards , and I tried to pursue the truth in this world . The cards combination that I created was called Unification , and with that intention , I believed that there was not much difference between the races , or even many other things . The only things that I saw differently was the very basic elements in the world . " <p> Brendel listened carefully and sat down . He thought for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brendel said : " I do n't  really get what you mean , can you make it simpler ? " <p> Brendel did not have the mood to think anymore . He only felt that the Planeswalker from Tulman was a new profession to could bring a great change in his future . He did not understand why , or perhaps he was under a wrong impression , but his intuition was telling him that the cards were much more than he thought they would be . <p> Tulman nodded : " Certainly . To speak about Planeswalkers , you have to start with the cards . Every single card represents a different viewpoint in this world . It is not just a simple projection , or replica of reality . With the cards coming together , they would form a small world that is not unlike this world . Planeswalkers are the only ones who are able to bring true meaning from from these cards and turn it to power in the world . " <p> He paused for a while before continuing . " Like the cards combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards that combines six different elements to describe the qualities in this world , and it represents the meaning of my deck : The power of Laws . " <p> " And I know of one other Planeswalker , " He continued . " His cards combination is called Infinite power , comprised mostly of Red and Black Cards of Fate as a combination . He pursued the strongest power . The Red cards can be seen as Fire , but it can also be seen as strength . The Black cards can be seen as Darkness , but it can also be seen as death and destruction . " <p> " Of course , we both failed to reach the truth of cards . " He shook his head , then smiled again . " The meaning of the cards is made of up of the combination . The Cards of Fates unique point is allowing many viewpoints to describe the Laws the world and yourself . One can even see it as the cards representing the inner you . " <p> " As to where the cards come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . The earliest Planeswalker should have been born during the Era of Darkness , and I suspect that these are created by the people of Matteya . <p> It is said that the Matteya is a group of dimension nomads , who move to one place to another . Their understanding of the world is different from ours . We think that the world is a infinitely vast place , with infinite things and knowledge , but the Matteya perceives the world as very small with a very narrow view . They have a concept called uhs , which is also the origin the Elven and Kirrlutz infinite . In their eyes , uhs contain countless worlds , and they are constantly shifting between them . <p> I suspect that they understood they have twisted the meaning of the Guardian Land and the world world , and develop a concept like this . However , it is also true that the humans have a limited knowledge of this world . " Tulman suddenly laughed . " I unintentionally talked too much about pointless things , it looks like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Brendel asked a question : " I have also heard of the Matteya , and perhaps they are the earliest Planeswalker , what does this have anything to do with me ? " <p> " The Matteya splits a single day into six phases , and strictly speaking a Planeswalker also splits the day into six phases . <p> The first phase Six AM to Ten AM , break of dawn to morning . <p> The Matteya calls this stage as the Growing Sun , while the Planeswalkers call it the Growth period . In this stage , a Planeswalker can tap their land cards , and get their mana for the day " <p> " Wait ! " Brendel said : " Tapping of land cards ? " <p> " Indeed , tapping of land cards . This is the basic ability of a Planeswalker , and their source of power . " <p> " Can you explain a little more ? " Brendel said . <p> " Its very simple . If you have a land card , Elemental Pool and Mana Pool , you can tap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land card will draw the energy from the territory that they belong to and link it to your Elemental Pool . This way the energy that is created from your territory will be converted into Elemental Power and placed in your Elemental Pool . " <p> " That single Elemental Point is outside the Elemental and Mana pool . Its purpose is used for the new users who wished to pursue the path of a Planeswalker , to allow you to use and understand the worlds power . When you become an official Planeswalker , you would n't need it anymore . " <p> Brendel nodded . " Understood . Please continue . <p> " At the Growth Phase , a Planeswalker can also gain the bonus of the additional effects . An example would be the Highland Squire card . As long as your Highland Squire in on the field , the owner will receive one reputation point . And this reputation point is given during your Growth Phase . <p> Brendel frowned . He had never thought about this before . Ciel had talked about this before , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The Second Phase Ten AM to two PM . <p> Matteya calls this : Exuberant Growth . <p> The wizards and witches call this period , the Falling Tide . It is the day where the Sun is at its peak , and the moon at its weakest . As Mana is weakened , the Elements are stronger . It is the period where the Elements are active , and has the Phase where it has the most offensive power . <p> Planeswalkers call this the Prime Phase . This is the only time when a Planeswalker can use any card without limits . At the same time he can even draw three additional cards from his deck to place into his hand . " ( TL : Hand refers to the set of cards , not the limbs ) <p> Brendel was confused : " What do you mean by drawing cards ? " <p> " This is the law of the Planeswalker . At the start of every day , you can only have a set amount of cards . You might be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you reach the Reset Phase , you have to discard the additional cards in your hand . <p> At the same time , the stronger a Planeswalker is , the more cards he can control in his hand . For someone who has just started like yourself , you can only control five cards . " <p> " Are the cards in my hand controlled ? " Brendel asked . <p> " No , the cards in your hand can only be taken in the card combination that you have . My card combination is Unification from six different elements , thus the Laws separate my card combination into six equal decks . " <p> Brendel frowned : " Does n't  that mean that the uncertainty of the cards are increased ? Isnt it better that I hold on to a limited number of powerful cards and discard the useless ones so that I can maintain my deck strength ? " <p> " In theory that is true , but that is not the final goal of a Planeswalker . " <p> " Final goal ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Elements and become stronger than before . You might not know this , but after the unlocking of the Elements is the pursuit of Perfect Physique , from Iron-ranked to Gold-ranked . But that final step , is to pursue the transcendent limits of power described only in legends . " <p> " As you know , fire is a component of many things , and the purest form is a Fire Element , as it is the basis of all flames . But there has always been a rumor of something even higher than a Fire Element called , Matter . <p> Matter , Time , Space , even Logic . It forms of the worlds most basic principles , and we call it Existent Force " <p> Brendel stared at Tulman speechlessly . He knew of the Perfect Physique as he as Level 130 in the game , a Silver Perfect Physique . He had also heard of the Existent Force . <p> Players in the game reported that they did not gain any further experience after level 160 in the game . There was rumors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get there . <p> " You mean to say , " He stuttered : " A Planeswalker can get to that Existent Force ? " <p> Tulman nodded and pointed to the card floating in the air : " When you have created your world , and the Laws reach an equilibrium with the cards , the path to the Existent Force will open to you . But before that , you have a long way to go , and it starts from your most basic card combination . " <p> " What do I need to do ? " <p> " The truth is , the moment you got your first card , you have revealed your combination . But I 'm a little puzzled I have never seen your combination before . It seems to show something about a Profession System . I do n't  understand why youre interested in that . And what does this All Supreme Profession Dominance mean ? " Tulman said with a perplexed expression . <p> Brendel broke into a cold sweat when he heard that . He was in the mindset of Sophie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At that time as a gamer he naturally wanted to have a strong profession , and it seemed that his Middle School Second-year Syndrome had been caught by the Cards of Fate . <p> Holy shit ! Opening the Path of Knights or something crazy like that .. If the Cards of Fate brings ones viewpoint in the world Then I 'm going to do that All Supreme Profession Dominance as a reality ? <p> Thanks for the chapter But yeah , the sort kinda lost me on this one . This magic the gathering style system feel like it has been thrown in for the sake of saying " look i 'm different and is over complicating matters . Hopefully it does n't  turn out to be as weird as it sounds so far . <p> You have no idea how many times I groaned while reading this chapter . Why did the author have to bring magic the gathering into his story ? ? Wasnt he enough of a special snowflake with the gaming system ? Planeswalkers .. <p> I 'm not surprised about him being a special snowflake . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different type of special snowflake with a completely different system . MTG never had a good story background . It was just kind of slapped on there afterwards . I just hope the rules for MTG do n't  mess up the story too much , since I 've liked what there was to this story so far . <p> Holy shit . Its really MtG . I thought it was similar when I first saw the gain mana from once per week card but wow . This is just ridiculous , quite stupid imo but I 'll keep reading since the novel has been interesting before this . Hope it does n't  become any more stupid . I usually do n't  like the MC having a completely different system from the rest of the world and this is pretty much precisely going in that direction . <p> Well , that was sudden . I feel like the author could have picked a less heavy handed approach to implementing the card system . It almost feels out of place in spite of the early introduction of the cards . Just changing the explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more natural . Drop the MTG terminology and describe some natural process instead and it would have worked .

They would be dead if the undead skeleton army rushed in . <p> Crashing sounds emitted from the door as sharp swords hacked in and out .

He opened it and went inside before locking it again . <p> Sophie coughed once , but the merchant girl behind him was coughing in distress .

The bright starry light painted the night , stars that held legendary tales of gods and myths . <p> She stood at the village entrance and looked at the hilltop . Freya was slightly worried .

I heard that it was unsafe recently and asked her to stay at my home for two days , but she did not agree to it . " <p> The young boy looked at her wide eyes . <p> The girls light orange hair was tied into a long ponytail , and her figure appeared to give out a heroic atmosphere . She wore a greyish white leather armor , and in it was a thick set of cotton shirt , the symbol on her left shoulder painted with black dye to look like a painting of pine leaves . <p> On her waist was a short rapier , and on the sword guard was a fire emblem . <p> If Sophie took a look , he would instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the most common tree in Elsengrad mountainous regions , and it was also the symbol of the Bucce forces . <p> But the guards also wore a well made combat robe , and only the militia would wear a greyish white leather armor made from cowskin . <p> In Aouine , every youth would receive militia training , and it usually started from the age of fourteen . The training would take place every year starting from the October to March until they reached nineteen . The youths and adults who received the training would be able to become militia , and become the most important reserves during times of war . This rule was set during the Year of Thunder , and militia training became one of the most important measures in Aouines military initiatives . <p> " Isnt that guy staying over there , I heard he was a militia at Bruglas .

Even though he won in the end , he paid a great price , till the point where the people of Kirrlutz bore hatred for the Wild Elves . <p> It was also because of their nature that many of the Wild Elves permeated the human mercenaries , allowing the formation of Mercenaries of Lopes . <p> " My lord , which type of bolts do you wish to have ? " The older twin with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Bolts of Ice and Wind , how many of these two bolts can you create altogether ? " <p> " If I use all my magic , I can create ten . " <p> " I can create six . " The younger twin answered with a crisp voice . <p> " Good , " Brendel cut them off : " Give me seven each for the two types I asked for , then give me two Bolts of Guidance . " <p> The two sisters exchanged puzzled looks with each other , then back at their lord . In the end the older sister asked with a small voice : " My lord , I understand if you wanted the Bolts of Binding Wind and Bolts of Shattering Ice , but is n't the Bolt of Guidance paired with an additional Magic property ? " <p> Bolts that were created with magic could have multiple properties applied to them , especially when if higher ranking magic was used . If someone wasted the usage of a Dragon-Slaying Bolt , that would be a great loss . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front , and the most common type of such bolts was the Fire Bolts of Guidance . <p> The only time when the Bolts of Guidance were typically used , was when the nobles who wanted to cheat during a hunting competition <p> Brendel answered with a cheerful smile . <p> " Do n't  worry , the both of you just need to follow what I asked for . When you 're done , go behind the back and rest alongside with Amandina and Romaine . You can leave the battle ahead to the other mercenaries . " <p> The older sister nodded . Even though she had her doubts , she knew that her lord was overly confident and incredibly stubborn , and wisely chose to not question his decisions . However , her sister frowned deeply and asked : " But , my lord " <p> " Tia . " The older sister shouted with strictness in her voice . <p> Tia looked at her older sister in surprise , understood her intentions , and ceased any thoughts of speaking again . <p> Brendels eyes went wide for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though all of them here are summoned from a card , they had their own judgment , memories and feelings . Even Amandina thought they are truly my retainers . <p> Brendel thought about Ciels sacrifice for a moment , and a bitter smile formed on his lips . <p> Did I appear like a cold and cruel lord ? Am I not smiling enough in front of them ? The sisters reactions feel like they are treading carefully around me . Surely there is n't a huge misunderstanding somewhere right ? <p> He suddenly turned his head back and saw Amandina trying to suppress his giggles while Romaine was smiling freely at him , as if they were watching a great show . <p> Am I still your lord ? What 's with your attitudes ! Brendel grumbled in his mind but tried to squeeze a cheerful smile . <p> " Do n't  worry about it . " He said to the girls . <p> The bolts were quickly handed over to him after a short while . Brendel required only half of them back in his world , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try in this world . <p> Two Elementalists of the Second Circle would not be able to help out much in the battle ahead , so its good to allow them to rest now and prepare for any unforseen events later on . <p> He placed each bolt to the holding area of the heavy crossbow to allow the quick access to them . He raised his head and found the mercenaries to be in place . He was more relaxed now that the mercenaries followed his orders carefully , but the Nightsong Tiger crunched his already weathered face into further furrows and wrinkles as he observed his lords actions . <p> " I already said everything is going to be fine , Commander . " Brendel sighed . <p> No matter how much he explained , the Nightsong Tiger refused to leave his side . He had the same concern as Ciel had , and if there was any danger that arose , he would be able to sacrifice himself to give Brendel enough time to escape . <p> " My lord , please allow me to accompany you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still revive me . Please treat me like a shield . " The Nightsong Tiger answered without any fear . <p> Revive , revive . Hear , hear , that would mean that I have to pay an additional maintenance fee for you and I have to wait an additional day to resummon you , Ser Nightsong Tiger ! <p> Brendel listened to his reasoning with exasperation and humor . He looked back at Amandina and Romaine , making sure there were far enough where Romaine was unable to hear them , before whispering to the Nightsong Tiger in the softest voice possible . <p> " Do your men know about the Planeswalkers magic to revive you ? " <p> The Nightsong Tiger shook his head : " Each Card of Fates has its own core , or you can think of them as the leader . My men are branches of the main core , and within this card , I am the core who helps the Planeswalker maintain the branches and attach this card to another related card or magic . " <p> " Theres a setting like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of something : " That would mean each Core has their different knowledge about the Planeswalker ? " <p> " Yes , and it has something to do with the cards themselves . " <p> " Then do you know how to get a card out of the Graveyard ? " <p> " The Black Cards are mysterious and could easily shift out of life and death . If you wish to use a strategy around fishing the cards out of a Graveyard , then you would probably need to acquire the cards with Dark Elements . Such cards are typically found in swamps , graves , or places with the undead like to gather . " ( TL : Some terms are a little fuzzy to me , so I need to check exactly what terms were used . ) <p> Brendel nodded and prepared his bow . <p> " Very well . You can stay here , but do not make any sudden moves . " He gazed on the derelict temple beneath the cold moonlight . <p> It probably has been two hundred years since any sentient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left this place behind . <p> His thoughts strayed a little as he checked the time . In the game , luring a monster was a considerable skill , and pro-gamers were able to predict their path down to their position . Against monsters with lower intelligence , remembering the path was sufficient , against sentient monsters , it was a battle between wits . <p> Brendel had never stopped practicing this particular skillset , even though it was mostly a job that Hunters took . However , a party was sometimes found lacking of such a profession , and as a Warrior , it was expected to have some experience in luring . <p> " Eight , seven " He muttered to himself . <p> The Nightsong Tiger did not understand what he was counting . His actions were completely bizarre to the natives of this world . <p> With the advancement of the technology in the world , the artificial intelligence in the game had reached to a point where they accurately mimicked humans . However , the gamers still perceived them as numbers and data to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine to perceive fluctuations in the data . <p> Everything had their own rules . <p> Brendel estimated the remaining time , and the crossbolts trigger was pressed with his finger . The first bolt notched into the crossbow was an ordinary bolt , which sang across the air with a shrilling scream , parting the misty air into two as it flew in an arc to the temples grounds covered with shadow . <p> " Six , five " <p> The noise from the bolt immediately attracted the attention of the hostile undead , appearing quickly to the sides of the temple to investigate . <p> Here he comes ! The Nightsong Tiger was tense as he gripped his axe tightly . <p> But Brendel threw away his heavy crossbow and took out a shortbow which hung from his waist belt , another incomprehensible action in the Nightsong Tigers eyes . <p> LOL right , and if the boss/monster dmg did n't  recover when left alone like in most recent online game I would kite it , mainly using magic/long range attack or just simple hit and run with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch up on my chapter backlog it ends on a cliffhanger sigh I figure he already has failed the first quest trigger by letting that girl die/get captured to be converted into a monster I 'm presuming the nest will be used to summon in order to try and complete this mission but as he is working off incomplete information will things work out at all ? It was suspicious that a killed character was given their ow POV and introduction while never appearing on the scene so I presume Brendel will somehow get involved with that . <p> Also the cards fate is kinda cruel the mercenary leader know he is a card while the rest are pawns but still have intact personalities and human emotions ? does n't  that mean each time the card is removed from play or dismissed it is basically killing them ? 0o <p> To be honest , the text never make it very clear as to how much the side characters of a card understand . I assume that they do know they are summons , but they do n't  understand how the mechanics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the Core , and for this example , the Nightsong Tiger . <p> I believe that all of the side characters can be revived even if they are killed though . <p> And in the end , I caught up ! Wonderful novel , really a good choice . I 'm a bit upset with the lack of statistics about the protagonist since the author decided to introduce them , but that is the only real complaint that I have ( a bit more descriptions of the environment and the characters would be good , to say the truth ) . I enjoy your translation , and as a fellow translator , I agree about the reshuffle of the sentence structures , the elimination of Chinese constructions that are considerable redundant when transported directly in English , and general correction of inconsistencies . You 're writing in English , so you should use English common sense . On the names , instead , I do n't  agree ; I find important to respect the choices of the author " obviously when you transliterate you should do it rightly , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find going beyond what a **25;28;TOOLONG should do , but I do understand that you believe in the localization theory , so : your translation your rules , is a minor thing in the end . That said , I want to give you an advice : in English , and in general in the Indoeuropean languages , you do not put but in a primary clause preceded by a subordinate which starts with an " ERROR? " " but " , since " but " is used to negate the logic repercussions on the primary clause of the one(s) that precedes it , but this job is already done by the conjunction in the subordinate . Other than being awkward , is logically wrong since you are doing a double negation , affirming that the situation in the first clause is indeed negating the logic of the second one ( a bit redundant as a description , but I hope is understandable ) . I do n't  really know why is an error so common in English . Other advice : try to use more frequently pronouns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over again in short distances . With this two simply expedients you will enhance the quality of the writing substantially ( I 'm telling you this since many chapters ago you wished to be a better writer ; you are obviously free to do what you want with them ( : ) <p> Thanks for the tips , the thing about the but issue happens sometimes because of the original text ( sometimes chinese raws love to use double negative ) and I did n't  redo it in English . Most of the chapters are in the 1st draft phase , so I 'll see if I can fix it up later on . <p> In every case of the pronouns , the Chinese raws would have the name directly written 95% of the time , i.e , Brendel does this , Brendel does that . They hardly use , He/she/it . <p> However , I do admit that I need to study rules on certain structuring of the sentences . The only issue is time , and a lot of the time that I have is spent on just translating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and minor grammar mistakes . <p> Yeah , I feel you , but I also assure you that even only having in mind the problematic trends one usually have when translating help a lot in eliminating them without having to pay attention . For example , that way I resolved with the bad habit to put " an " before " h+vocal " when writing quickly " well , I still do mistake from time to time , but better than nothing . I wish you luck and hope you 'll bring us till the end of this journey ( : <p> I feel like the real story has n't  begun like this is all a premise to what 's to come I think the best parts will happen after Madaras forces pull back and when he gets his " reward " for saving everyone and his heroics

I should TL 1 more TAS chapter tomorrow as the regular update . <p> - <p> Chapter 40 Magicite <p> The girls reply stopped everyone , and they looked back at her . Amandina looked at the young man and spoke softly . <p> " Ser , please be at ease . I will fulfill the agreement in the letter with my personal thanks as well . " <p> Brendel was a little surprised at her determined and even confident expression . <p> No matter how I look at her situation , she ca n't pay any significant amount of gold , but is it because of her pride that she wants to fulfill the agreement ? This situation is going further away from gaming common sense <p> " How do you intend to do that , lass ? " Batum looked at her from top to bottom , with the usual unrefined tone with deliberate quips from his mercenary ways : " Even though you 're considered a fine looking girl , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found its way into Amandinas eyes and cheeks when she heard that . She looked at Brendel with flushed cheeks due to anger , and Brendel saw disappointment in her eyes . She opened the drawer next to the table and retrieved a big scroll . She stopped for a while before she finally passed the papers to Brendel : " I believe the value in these papers are no less than what you expect , Ser Brendel . " <p> " What is this ? " He asked as he took the scroll . <p> " My research . " She looked a little uneasy when she said these words , but she appeared confident again . <p> The cripple snorted derisively , and Batum poked him from behind and whispered : " How much gold do you think the girl owes my lord ? " <p> Roen turned back and looked blankly at Batum . Even though the hood covered his face , he could clearly see the red knotted beard . <p> " You do n't  know ? " <p> " Of course I do n't  ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thought you knew . Let 's see , even a poor noble like Berg should have an annuity of two thousand coins . Calculating it Well , its around a hundred thousand Tor coins . Its not a huge sum of money , but its no paltry sum either . " <p> " That is indeed a considerable sum . " Batum nodded . " Do you mean to say that the papers in my lords hands are worth a hundred thousand coins ? " <p> " I did not say anything like that . If its something that comes from a famous painter , well , fetching a few million coins is n't surprising . But that little girl had already said its her research . Ill be honest with you , I do n't  think its worth anything that much , otherwise this little girl would n't need to stay in this place already . " <p> " Youre really a nasty piece of work . " <p> " Thats a logical conclusion , Ser Batum . " <p> Amandina clenched her fists when she overheard their conversation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engrossed in checking out the scroll with one hand . He was a little puzzled over it as it felt quite heavy in his hand . <p> Paintings ? Old Magic ? Or some lore copied from old books ? The quality of the scroll is quite bad , but there 's some considerable weight to it . <p> " Can I take a look at the contents of these papers ? " Brendel asked . <p> " They are already yours . " <p> Brendel nodded and carefully unfolded it . It was a complicated array of lines that formed into some form of machine . The multiple patterns and arrays were carefully written all over the scroll , along with detailed explanation with the girls elegant handwriting . His heartbeats quickly increased when he saw the contents of the scroll , and comprehension dawned on his face while he rolled the scroll back up . <p> It was the earliest blueprint for creating a machine that moved mana . <p> The overall concept in this design can be considered as crude or terrible But I see so this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guild Origin got the original blueprints for producing this type of machinery and allowed players to gain their own independence . <p> Brendel did not expect to encounter the answer to be like this . He did not expect the girl to have anything to do with the top ten questions in The Amber Sword , and he was genuinely surprised at the outcome . <p> " The guild leader did not infiltrate an empire or the likes , he simply completed this one-time secret mission " <p> Brendel used all his will to keep his face from changing . The scroll in his hands meant that it was enough to change the world greatly . <p> Owning a third type of power in this world . <p> The first type of power was Elements . Fire , wind , water , earth , space , time and many others . Physical examples existed as well . Professions like warriors , Elementalists , wizards , and many powerful classes have different qualities , but they share a common measuring unit called Oauth . <p> The power of Elements are typically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossed 500 OZ . Under the Holy Church of Fire description , people who crossed 500 OZ had Enlightened Elements in them . From that moment onwards , these people would be crowned as Holy knights. - ( TL : Okay . You know those recent modern games like to simplify things by reducing the amount of buttons/commands right ? Everything press F to **31;55;TOOLONG ? Apparently OZ does the same thing here . If I TLed anything wrongly , well ) <p> This was a long journey and even impossible for many to go through . The majority of the population are born with just 0.3 OZ , and would be unable to surpass that 500 OZ limit . However , there were people who blessed and simply had the talent to surpass the limits , therefore they were called The Chosen beings . <p> The second type of power did not belong to humans . They were called as the Power of the Gods , and more exactly the power of faith . <p> The Gods were split into two factions , Ximar and Einkar . Ximar was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stars and magic , and there were called as gods . Their presence supported this world , and though they did not need the worship of the beings in this world , they had answered their prayers through their faith . <p> This response was called the Power of the Gods . The source of the powers from the priests were from their will , taking care of their children from high above . And because of that , many different religious factions argued constantly , speaking of misinterpreted instructions or expressing their reluctance to change the world from the signs of the gods . <p> The third power , was the power of wisdom , and the power that mortals had to change the world . <p> The so called machine in Brendels hands was also called Magicite . Under the artificial ( machine ) design , revolution to move the energy in the Element crystals , either to power a magic weapon or floating city . This was originally the creation of the craftsmen in Buga , but the various empires soon took hold of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire chessboard in this world . They started off with production which led to a new industrial revolution , and the struggle to gain for resources created new factions and powers . The records started from one hundred years ago , and the Holy War lasted for ten over years , of which the November War was most infamous for . <p> I now hold the blueprints of a Magicite Even though it is lacking in many ways and even considered behind the empires technology by thirty years , this is the true secret that gamers thought they would never get . In The Amber Sword , the magicite called Star Constellation was created twenty years into the game and is the same design that this scroll has . <p> Brendel took a deep breath and asked : " You designed this ? " <p> Amandinas expression was originally tense but she was taken aback when she heard the question . <p> " Y-you understand it ? " <p> She had gotten all her knowledge from books , and spent long hours into designing the machine . Even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her success might be limited if she continued to go on this path . Even so , she put all her time and money into this road , selling her family properties and almost got cheated by a deceptive merchant . If her status as a noble did not protect her , she would have become a plaything of someone else . <p> But she did not give up and believed that she had found a way to create a Magicite . She had created this version with a fatal flaw that it required too much materials to create a single Magicite . Despite that , she believed her designs were valuable enough , and was prepared to face Brendels sarcasm . <p> Except she did not expect him to take her seriously . <p> He understands my work ? <p> " Its very rough , but at least its a completed version . " <p> " No , no , Ser Brendel , you do n't  understand this , " The girl coughed because she spoke too quickly : " This design is only half completed , the input @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " What ? You dare to use a half completed blueprint to pay for your debts ! " The cripple immediately jumped when he heard that . <p> Brendel gestured to Batum to stop Roen from making any more noise , then looked at Amandina and said earnestly . <p> " This is fine . In my eyes , this is a transaction that is worth even more than I expected , and you fulfilled your promise . " <p> Brendel did not lie and it certainly exceeded his expectations compared to gaining Bergs treasures . <p> It is an exageration . I just want to make a point is that , this thing is so big , a game changer , something that changes the world . <p> If you look at history , you will find events that send the human world to a sudden leap . This is particularly apparent with some discoveries and inventions . Fire , wheel , bacteria , electricity , logic , computers , etc .. These things changed the world to the point that it is unrecognizable . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . Brendel has received something worth more than the treasures promised to him . <p> the difference is that this machine already exists somewhere in the world ( it says " the plans are 30 years late compared to empire tech " ) <p> however its like getting the plans for the nuke .. ( but for a much more useful object ) : even getting the plans of a model that is 30years beyond the most advanced enables to propel you from no-go nation to " top-ten nation " = <p> Thank you for the chapter .

However , with Aouines decline and the knights retaining their own power in their local region , as well as adventurers turning to lawless endeavors and without anyone interested in expanding the kingdoms boundaries , the term of a Pioneering Knight gradually became a title that did not have any power to it . <p> Some time after the first king of Aouine , nobles slowly started to auction this title after they had solidified their foothold , and this piece of parchment slowly lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did it in the game .

There were numerous illegal goods including human trafficking . The people who participated this event ranged from mercenaries , adventurers , illegal merchants and even Bruglass lawmakers . <p> Without a doubt , there were also nobles . <p> The people who controlled this market were certainly from the local underground factions , but it was known to many that there were nobles who participated in them , and none would be the wiser if they maintained a peaceful and stable society for the citizens . <p> The auction site was usually held at the Marias market in Hood street or the eastern area at the Shepherd market . These areas were filled with people , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as cover . People who paid close attention would discover that many unfamiliar faces would appear on certain days , and talked to each other and leave on the second morning . <p> These markets had mini auction sites that were used as cover , while the true sites were constructed only during the period and then dismantled . <p> These constructions might appear to be funded by ordinary merchants , but if one was to investigate , the funds came from the local parliament of nobles . <p> When Batum assisted Brendel down from the horse carriage , Bruglass evening sun lit the surroundings with a fiery hue that seemed to make things look like they were burning . In this light , Ciel wore a knights uniform and held his chest up high in order to make Brendel look like a highland knight from Karsuk . <p> Behind Brendel was Amandina and Romaine , acting as his younger sister and fiancee respectively . <p> Amandina removed her hand discreetly from Brendels helping hand when she alighted from the carriage . She wore a black veil and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auction site with a disinterested expression . <p> She appeared to be completely different than before .

Even Tirstes scout would not be able to recognize her even if he was nearby . <p> When Amandina disappeared from her home , no one noticed it until a few days later . The disappearance of a person typically belonged to the city guards , but the city cavalry had done a large scale manhunt for her . Three medium sized platoons searched the eastern area and nearly alerted Bruglass parliament . <p> However , Lord Tirste did not want this event to trace back to him , and tied the disappearance to a prior case that happened half a year ago , and made it as a case about a headless corpse . <p> This was why Amandina was able to go outside safely . <p> Beside her was Romaine who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a row of crystal balls nearby . Her frowning eyebrows were knitted together , as if she was a researcher trying to analyze what exactly they were . <p> Even if you stare at it however long you want , or however serious you are , there wont be anything that appear in it , you know .. Brendel was a little exasperated . <p> He was certain that Romaine was trying to get Amandinas attention . <p> Romaine and Amandina got along well for the past few days , and she was especially delighted to have Amandinas knowledge about the outside world from her books . It was at least better than Romaines knowledge that came from her imagination . <p> " What exactly is that , Ama ? " Romaine finally could not resist asking . <p> Amandinas concentration was also on the row of crystal balls . The owner was a man wearing a black uniform . Not anyone had the qualifications to wear that uniform , and it clearly showed that he was a priest . <p> Amandina turned her eyes to Brendel , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused for a moment and frowned . <p> " Thats a Fire seed .

I did n't  think I am able to witness something like this here in an auction . " <p> " I do n't  understand . " Romain answered in a straightforward manner . <p> Amandina sighed in spite of herself . Brendel did not disappoint her in the past few days . She did not think that he was truly a knight , and one who was a legendary highland knight . Furthermore , he had acted in a polite manner most of the time , handled situations calmly and effectively , and fulfilled the image of a feudal lord in her mind <p> This fiancee of his is giving me a slight headache .

" As an advisor , she knew that Brendel had bought the title of an Pioneering Knight . <p> Brendel glanced at the crystal balls . He was interested at their appearance , but there were definitely others who were interested in them as well , so he could only try to bid for it .

He walked up to him and the cripple informed him that the auction was about to begin and they should hurry along .

What I got from this part is that she aware that how far her researches goes depend on how far he can goes , not only that , she also does n't  has a choice since only he can appreciates her talent so for better or worse , her own well-being depends entirely on his success . 
@@37042307 @6042307/ <h> Update progress <p> I kind of fell sick since Monday ( still coughing and out of breath ) and that seriously hurt my progress in quite a number of assignments . There will be 1 chapter of TAS and TSTBGAM on Sat and Sun . <p> Also , just as I suspected , my group project is up and the deadline for it is 1 month . This particular one is important because I need to stick with my team members closely to ensure that we do n't  look different from each other . <p> So for the near future , I 'll be cutting back on TAS and TSTBGAM until the project is done ( any donated chapters will also have to wait ) . Fortunately , were not really at a cliffhanger and I 'll do another mass release 2-3 months later when my term break comes up .

He had never done fishing in his short life No matter how you look at it , this activity did not suit the image of royalty . <p> " Of course its you I 'm making honey roasted meat and fish with herb soup , either you 're getting the meat or fish , which one are you choosing ? ! " <p> " I 'm getting the fish . " <p> Meat ? !

It was an insult to Fedrus , but he grudgingly spent half an hour to find suitable bait . At first he wanted to use some strips of meat , but Sue refused that idea since she thought it was a waste , and suggested him to use meat bones instead .. But he refused because he was worried that there were no fishes that could swallow something so big . <p> Ultimately , Fedrus wrote down a IOU note of 10 gold to Sue , buying a bunch of worms dug from the ground and settled the issue of bait . <p> So it was the technical aspect next .. <p> " Brat , fishing is not done like that .

When he swung the fishing rod , the hook did not land into the water but went for her underwear that was drying on the tree top <p> He had never seen someone drying clothes in the royal palace before as he had never gone to certain areas of the castle . <p> After introducing some of the vital notes on fishing and helping him throw the rod into the river , Sue rode on Xiao Bai and flew to the tree , and changed the underwears location to another place . Her main mission was to get the noble chibi to listen and work , but she was lazy to continue teaching him step by step . <p> " Little miss " <p> The merfolk came again and called Sue : " Can you help us bury this under the tree roots ?

" <p> " Xiao Bai , go and bury this . " She threw one at the tiger , while keeping the other in her dimensional ring .

I actually planned to fill the backlog of 20 chapters , but like I said before , the time to translate TAS has actually increased by an hour+ , and that 's the first draft without any edits . <p> Some of the issues include small illogical writing + political stuff for the recent chapters . <p> Yula is blind , but her interaction in the raws includes " Redi and Yula looked at each other " , really , author ? <p> Increase of name terminology + economy and political stuff . This particular section takes the longest because I have to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Various other minor issues . <p> There are some minor edits to how Brendel/Redi responds to Yula that I made . I feel that its necessary to remind the readers that while I do n't  generally change the plot , there are some areas that I have to change in order to have the story make logical sense . <p> A lot of time is spent on names because as we well know how many people hated the name Sophie ( 35% wanted me to change the name back to Su Fei vs 48% who said there 's no need to do so ) for the protagonist . If I had my way , I 'll just change the name entirely from the start because I do recognize that its awkward . However , since there 's some evidence that the author took the name from the novel Sophies world , I personally thought it was n't that bad because the meaning of Sophie is wisdom or wise , which I feel was appropriate in a certain sense . <p> Ill post at least 3 more chapters today . Just remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapter 79 The story of fishes swimming in chaos ( 1 ) <p> Brendel observed Yula who sat down on the ground filled with pine needles . He quickly realized that the girls hair was a lovely pure black that was unlike Amandinas , which was tinged with a purple sheen . <p> Surprise streaked across his eyes . <p> Amandinas bloodline probably came from the Miirnas bloodline , which causes her to have that black-purplish color in her hair and eyes . Over countless eras , that bloodline had eroded and they no longer had special traits related to that race . The only thing left was their appearances . But this Yula girl is probably not from that bloodline . <p> " I am unable to say why that is so as well , Ser knight . You could think it as a premonition instead . The Paper Cards mercenaries should have nothing to do with the disciples , but they appeared together tonight . Perhaps it is a coincidence , but I would believe in the possibility that this a planned scheme . <p> If I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have seeked for their allies help . Even though we do not deserve your full trust , but it would surely be better to have our aid . But you and your men chose to to leave here without any hesitation to preserve only for yourselves " <p> Yula closed her eyes and listened to the battle that the Grey Wolves Mercenaries were having with the Disciples of the Black Flames . Her tone did not change as she stated her opinion : " But if I was to change my way of seeing things , this would mean that Ser Brendel has already analyzed the current state of events That you have known that the Paper Cards was following us from the very beginning . <p> The oddity in your plan was the choice to escape to the east . I would think that a decisive decision like this would mean that you are not a rash person . If the enemies lies ahead of you and yet still you choose to charge forward , then that would be bravery . However , I believe that Ser Brendel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly lies ahead . Perhaps , its not guarded by the enemies ? " <p> Brendel did not change his expressions , although Redi had been showing rich expressions of mockery whenever Yula called Brendel a knight . <p> " As for the reason why Brendel is a knight . " She gave a small humble smile : " That is simply because I heard the lady over there calling you my lord . Although I was not given sight , Mother Marsha has given me sharp hearing , which really is n't something that I should brag . " <p> Amandina reacted by gasping and watching Yula in vigilance . <p> The blind girl raised her head up to Brendel , her eyes opening slightly . Even though she could not see him , she pleaded with him earnestly . " Ser Brendel , I humbly beg you to help the Grey Wolves Mercenaries . " <p> Brendel took in a deep breath . <p> If Amandina is someone who can aid me as an advisor , then this girl in front of me is a kingmaker . Her senses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied Yulas black eyes which had a tinge of brown in them . When he went over her pale yellow skin and delicate eyebrows , he suddenly recalled there was a certain region that he was familiar with . <p> " I also have a question . Is your surname Phenix ? " He asked . <p> Her eyes have already closed again , otherwise she would have shown great surprise . She felt the area around her chest subconsciously before she relaxed , as Brendel took in all her actions . <p> He frowned slightly , as if he had thought of more things . <p> " Yes , my surname is indeed Phenix , and my original name is Phenix Yul . It appears that Ser Brendel is very knowledgeable , and my appearance would certainly reveal itself to them . However , I do not wish to bring this up again . Please call me Yula and let me off with that . " <p> Brendel agreed to do so . He had guessed of a certain NPC which had the same skin tone and hair color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Nine Phenix kingdom . <p> The Nine Phenix kingdom was ruled by nine different clans , and the kingdom possessed an advanced swordsmanship called Sword of the Flaming Lotus . Many gamers had tried their luck by going to that country , but no one had ever obtained it . <p> Many of the countrys citizens traveled to Aouine and Kirrlutz , just like the elves who had traveled from the north . It was not rare for different explorers to leave their homeland and travel around . <p> In regards to Yulas request , he shook his head . " I am sincerely sorry to say that we cant help you . I can tell you that the Black Disciples will not be strong enough to cause your commander any real problems , but if I am Makarov I will leave this forest immediately . " <p> " You " Redi was so angry he seemed to lose his words for a moment : " Our agreement , you cant throw it away . The Mercenaries Oath .. " <p> The Nightsong Tiger punched him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain . The Nightsong Tiger shook his head with a look of disdain . <p> " Stop lying to yourself , your commander does n't  care about the agreement , even if they are fighting against the Black Disciples . " <p> " Do you understand our position ? " <p> She nodded . <p> " Then what would Ser Brendel want ? Money ? Power ? " <p> Brendel perked up his ears before he immediately shook his head again : " I am interested in all those things , but compared to money and power , I would rather not get embroiled into this troublesome situation . I will give you another hint . The mastermind behind the Black Disciples are the Tree Shepherds . Surely both of you have heard of that name before ? " <p> Their countenances changed at the same time . <p> " How did we get targeted by them ? " Redi asked with skepticism . <p> But Yula lowered her head in anxiety . <p> Amandina poked him from behind and whispered : " My lord , are you not letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isnt the conclusion of this ending going to end with something you do n't  wish to see ? " <p> Brendel raised his hands in defense : " I do n't  wish to lie to them . " <p> But under Amandinas suspicious gaze , he could only offer a more detailed explanation : " Helping them is not impossible , but I wo n't let us get dragged into this situation . " <p> " Then what is to be done ? " Romaine asked with blinking eyes . <p> " They have to rely on themselves . " <p> " Thats the solution ? " Romaine did not believe Brendel . <p> " Of course it will work . " <p> " Ser Brendel , what are we supposed to do ? " Yula overheard them and understood that Brendel was reminding them on purpose . She hesitated for a while , as if she was considering whether she could trust them . <p> The Tree Shepherds is like a bomb . The Unifying Guild can drive a kingdom into chaos , but the Tree Shepherds have enough clout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this era probably had harrowing experiences because of them . Since Yula is from another country , she would probably know less than Redi . <p> When Brendel looked back at Redi , he discovered that the white-haired youth looked deeply perplexed . <p> " I have already given you the answer , " Brendel said : " Tell your commander to retreat and leave this area . Judging from the circumstances the Tree Shepherds have targeted you , but they have a certain habit . Once they realized that their plans have been found out , they will most likely back off to plan again . With this , you have gained precious time and I think your commander will take measures to defend the Grey Wolves Mercenaries . " <p> Brendel might have appeared to analyze things thoroughly , but he was actually following what was on the walkthrough . The things that he did not know were the exact details and why the Tree Shepherds targeted the mercenaries . <p> However , that did not mean that he was unable to handle them . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madara , and there were still cards that he could use to fight back . <p> Redi looked at Yula once . <p> " How do we know that what you said is true ? " Redi grimaced . <p> " I am not forcing you to believe me . " <p> " You irresponsible bastard . " He barked . <p> " We have no need to be responsible to you . Do you understand the situation ? It is your mercenary group which is under attack , and my lord is helping you out of his kindness . It is your choice to choose not to accept the advice , if you are so proud . " Amandinas feathers have long been ruffled by Redi , and openly criticized him . <p> But once she was done with her outburst , she suddenly stopped and looked apologetically at Yula who was still kneeling down : " I 'm sorry , I mean " <p> " There is no need to concerned with my feelings . " Yula shook her head . She had been pondering in silence for quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that Ser Brendel is going to leave this place , right ? " <p> " Yes . " Brendel nodded . <p> " You cant stay for one more night ? " <p> " No , we cant . " <p> The Unifying Guild is one troublesome affair to deal with , having another Tree Shepherds would mean that the future is fraught with dire consequences . Since Makarov and Buga have a strong chance to come out of this without harm , there 's no need for me to meddle with things too much . Well , as long as they follow my advice , that is . <p> Even if he chose to leave , it was not as if he had let the Grey Wolves Mercenaries down . The agreement between them was as weak as it sounded , and the only real trouble was if he wanted to work with them in the future . <p> " Ser Brendel , are you willing to let us go ? " She asked again . <p> " We did not intend to do so , and the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this already , Miss Yula . " Brendel replied . <p> " But are you not afraid we will leak your location to the enemies ? " <p> Brendel laughed and said confidently : " There is no way that your group or the enemies can catch up to us . " <p> Brendel trusted in his experience , but Redi merely eyed him in silence . <p> It was clear from his expression that he thought Brendel was bragging . Even though there were many things that shocked him , he thought that Brendel had given himself away as an amateur by heading east , and he planned to persuade Yula not to be deceived by Brendel. <h> 13 thoughts on " The Amber Sword Volume 2 Chapter 79 " <p> some1 kill that kid redi already .

Tomorrows the first day of school , so Ill also see how tightly packed my schedule is . <p> Chapter 24 Withered trees <p> The deeper they went into the mountain pathway , the more desolate the scenery became . There was nearly no vegetation on the ground , and the path that was void of life was filled with intersecting rocks that appeared like sharp fangs . <p> Wilted brambles and grass had grown from within the cracks of the walls . Withered trees seemed to manifest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heard blowing through tree branches like ghastly whispers . <p> Brendel knew that Demonic Trees drained the nutrients from the soil and turned into this to a barren wilderness that people came to know about . He raised his torch , and there were occasional decrepit skeletons that appeared in the shadows . They appeared to be animals like mountain goats which had accidentally barged into this forbidden area , and turned into the Demonic Trees food . <p> Romaine nimbly followed behind with her torch raised with one hand , while she gripped her bag with the other and looked everywhere with curiosity and tension . This was the first time that she traveled this far away from her home , and she felt like she was beginning to fulfill a merchants dream . The difficulty , excitement and the endless wealth and treasures awaited her , just like how this dream nurtured the numerous other merchants and adventurers in this continent . <p> She even had a sense of security by following Brendel . <p> The two sources of light passed through the narrow valley . Brendels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed through this area in the game , he would have entered a den of monsters of a certain type called the Rotting Beasts . <p> The Golden Demonic Tree was a terrifying creature . It was a variant of the Golden Trees , and its former body was most likely the Holy Elven Tree . However , The Tree Shepherd who belong to one the great evil cults , implanted the tree with the Blood of Gods and turned it into a Golden Tree . <p> In this chaotic world , darkness thrived where civilizations fire was unable to reach , and not only did the undead exist , there were regions where leaders found their own evil cults . In the game , evil disciples followed the footsteps of The Tree Shepherd and did surreptitious things . There were signs of their actions everywhere , letting people know of their existence , but no one knew what their motives were . <p> Even Brendel was no exception . <p> The Golden Demon Tree had two abilities . The first was to turn plants into living creatures . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humans , and they were called Rotting Beasts . These Rotting Beasts were the scouts of the Golden Demon Tree which populate every area of this narrow valley . <p> A single Rotten Beast in the game was level 7 , and their strength was roughly the equivalent of the guards that Brendel saw , but their intelligence was considered low . Veteran ranked Rotten beasts were over level 13 , and this Grade 1 Rank was a difficult opponent for him . <p> The second ability it had was turn to infuse its fruits with demonic mana . When the fruits of the Golden Demon Tree fell onto the ground , it would turn into a wilderling creature , growing to over two meters tall within a day . These are elite guards of the Golden Demon Tree , and their level was between level 20 to 22 . The only chance Brendel had if he encountered them was to use the Ring of the Wind Empress . <p> After several decades , these Rotten Beasts and Demonic Creatures had accumulated to a large number . If Brendel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an impossible task for Romaine and himself to pass this narrow valley . He would also have to take special care to avoid the Golden Demon Tree which had reached the Grade 2 Rank . <p> They continued to progress with shuffling sounds from their footsteps , which sounded a little frightening in this lonely area . Brendel fondly remembered that he used to come here with a large bundle of ropes , oil , torch , dry rations and a hook to this area and fight the Golden Demon Tree hundreds of times . <p> The loot from the Golden Demon Tree was between 20 OZ and 30 OZ , and the best drop from it was the legendary Heart of the Golden Tree , which restored 1 hp every minute , and considered to be a godly artifact in the early game . <p> The only difference Brendel felt was the future merchant girl following behind him . He suddenly felt that it was somewhat romantic to adventure with the girl that he was interested in . ( TL : Was that a confession ? ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He turned around and noticed her gaze on his hand . He was slightly surprised as he found the Thorn of Light to be glowing with white light from its sheath . <p> There are undead nearby ! <p> He was startled but immediately realized that the Madara undead might have sent a squadron to patrol this area to ensure there was no one who slipped through their grasp . He relaxed a little as he considered a squadron to be an easy battle , as long as he did not alert the Rotten Beasts in the valley . <p> He pulled out the sword and started testing various directions . It turned brighter as he pointed to a specific location and he immediately knew they were ahead . He gestured for Romaine to stick closely to him and extinguished their torches and moved in that direction . <p> Indeed , there was a squadron of undead . Leading them was the necromancer Kabara . Its performance in Bucce not only let the human scout escape , it also led to the demise of a fellow necromancer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disappointing performance , and also to remind it not to be too eager to display himself in front of its master or superior . ( TL : Kabara appeared in Chapter 5 . ) <p> Kabara understood its error , but the urgent issue was how to defend against the Rotting Beasts in front of him . <p> The necromancer and its soldiers had first defeated a Rotting Beast that was in the form of a human with full of thorns , but three other Rotting Beasts immediately charged at them . A pair of glowing flames protected by branches , presumably on their heads , were glaring at the undead soldiers . When Brendel took a further look , he saw there were broken skeleton bones around the Rotting Beasts . <p> Their battle had begun . <p> What exactly are these creatures ? ! Kabaras green flames dimmed in its eye sockets . <p> Seeing that that the enemy was going to attack again , he could only reluctantly order its skeleton soldiers to change their weapons to their bows . The soldiers lit their arrows with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrows shot at the creatures . Two Rotting Beasts that were struck by the arrows yelled along their branches swaying about , causing a shuffling sound and they fell onto the ground , turning into two bright bundles of intense flames . <p> The necromancer instantly chuckled . They were indeed stronger than their skeletons , but these plants were afraid of fire . What a blunder , how did it not think of this point earlier . Kabara raised its staff , and caused the remaining Rotting Beast to explode into half , and a shower of wooden splinters flew everywhere . <p> Brendel climbed onto a white boulder and involuntarily laughed when he saw the necromancer gloating from the victory . <p> This moron is seeking death . It actually dared to use magic here . <p> The Golden Demon Trees favorite nutrient was mana and it sought after it like a drug . If there was any ripples of mana caused by any spells , it would immediately appear . This necromancer might not have known about it , but it was certainly courting death . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to find a way to go some place higher , otherwise they would killed along with these mindless undead . <p> He turned to Romaine and pulled her down . She had been looking and blinking at the undead . Her bright eyes did not contain fear , but curiosity . <p> " I recognize that necromancer . " She whispered . <p> " Shhh ! " <p> Brendel treated what Romaine said as a joke . The undeads appearance was similar enough to each other to make it hard to identify them , and they basically had no difference in their outer appearance other than the ripples of their soul . It was not only limited to the low ranking undead , and even when he identified the higher ranking ones , he did it by finding the decorations on their body or special bodily traits . <p> " I really do recognize it , Brendel , this was the one that I saw at your home from far away . " She sweared . <p> " Ookay , just lower your voice , if you alert them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Brendel squinted . He had already seen shadows advancing from the darkness , and based on their movements they should be Rotting Beasts . After counting over thirty of them , he stopped . The numbers were still increasing . Yet the necromancer still had not ordered the skeletons to extinguish the Soul Fire on their arrows . The Rotting Beasts were attracted to light , and he decided to treat them with their deaths as a foregone conclusion . <p> " There seems to be a lot of things around us , Brendel . " Romaine said . <p> " Yeah , come with me . Lower your body , and do n't  alert them . " <p> The two people continued to climb higher slowly with Brendel leading in front . He started to note the good points of bringing her along . She did not panic at all under this situation , and it was a difficult thing for a normal person to do so . <p> He recalled in the game where a bunch of female players in the party would scream whenever they entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassing situation , as some of the guys also did that too . <p> He reminisced as he progressed upwards and looked down quietly from time to time . <p> The rotting beasts had started to gather into torrents from several directions below , surrounding the necromancer and the few skeletons . Kabara finally felt something was amiss , and started to cast a spell of Shadow Curtain . But before he finished chanting , two dark red creatures came out from his blind spot from between the boulders and smashed his remaining skeleton soldiers to bits . <p> Marsha above , Lord Rothko ! What are these damn things , there was no need to patrol here at all ! <p> The necromancer did not care about its subordinates at all , as there was no compassion within the undead . But it was allowed to have self-preservation , and it jumped up onto the boulders quickly . A necromancers agility and strength were not low , but people tend to be misled by their appearance . <p> But Brendel did not enjoy this scene at all , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you fucking kidding me , can you choose a better direction ? ! <p> He obviously did not dare to pull out the Thorn of Light , otherwise in this darkness it would become a Lure of Light , where every enemy would have its eyes on him . <p> Fortunately , a dark red Rotten Beast suddenly jumped up to grab the necromancers ankle which sank a little . Right at this moment the Rotten Beasts had surrounded this area and all the skeleton soldiers had probably been crushed to bits . If Kabara hesitated for one second it would have followed their fate . <p> Kill it ! Brendel yelled in his mind . <p> He felt Romaine gripping his shoulder from behind , almost as if she was as tense as he was . Anyone who saw the situation would see that their positions would be exposed if the necromancer came any closer . <p> But Romaines breaths landed on his ears and made him a little distracted . He turned around to look at her , and found she was staring at some other place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his heart plunged into an icy river . <p> Sophie inherited Brendells memories and emotions , so he stills has some lingering feelings for her from his host .

@@37042323 @6042323/ <h> The Amber Sword Volume 2 Chapter 72 <p> TL : This is the initial draft . The next chapter should come two or three days later . <p> Chapter 72 Brendels strategy <p> Brendel turned back and indeed saw the white-haired man wearing a frosty expression . <p> What came next into his sight were ten odd Juddelan heavy infantry men . The Juddelan was one of Aouines most commonly hired mercenaries . These men lived in regions near the sea , and all their eleven ports were frequently hassled by pirates . With these constant battles , the citizens of Juddelan naturally became mercenaries . <p> A typical Juddelan mercenary wore a well crafted and heavy scale armor , a long flame-forged steel spear , and on top of the spear held a shield half the size of a man . Finally their waist was adorned with higher grade swords and axes that were handed down from their ancestors . <p> Brendel knew them well from the game . <p> " What is going on ? " He jerked his horse to stop it from moving as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Messere , " Amandinas obsidian eyes beheld a clear alertness as she turned around to answer Brendel : " They clearly do not trust me if they place this group of heavy infantry behind us . " <p> Brendel took another glance behind her and realized something suddenly . He merely smiled : " Not trusting is a normal reaction . " <p> " But " <p> Redi snorted in displeasure at Amandinas continued disapproval . <p> Brendel eyed at him once and asked : " Then what is the reason for putting these Juddelan men behind us ? " <p> " It does not concern you . " Redi snapped . <p> " Ser , these men usually move slower in the forest , " It was the shorter youth who came along with Redi in the morning who walked over . He jerked Redis sleeve , while he continued to answer : " Commander Makarov also placed them here to handle ambushes , and its not because of the distrust towards everyone here . " <p> " Wonderful , killing two birds with one stone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget to ridicule Redi : " But your partner is just awful at communication compared to you . " <p> Redis face flashed in anger and flung his arm to get rid of his partners pull , leaving the other youth behind . Brendel took a longer look at the youth in front of him : " What 's your name ? " <p> " Im Sanford . " <p> " Sanford , that name does n't  sound like the locals . " <p> " I 'm originally an apprentice baker in Bruglas which was before I became a mercenary . Ser , your accent seems like one from there too . " <p> " I 'm not , but the girls are . " Brendel pointed his chin at them . <p> Sanford gave a shy smile and looked at the girl riding behind Brendel . But she turned her face away to the side and did not look at him . Even though she was a poor noble , she had the temperament of a typical Aouine noble who refused to be friendly to typical commoners . Romaine did not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was from Bucce and considered as a neighbor . <p> " It sounds like this reasoning is fine , but to bring heavy infantry in the forest is a sign of i 'll consideration . " Amandina looked at the Juddelan men as she spoke . <p> But there was a loud retort that came swiftly when she finished her words . <p> " Serah , messere , pray hold your words . We have to work for our meals , and commander Makarov was kind enough to accept us , so we have to pledge our loyalty . It behooves us to follow our group , have you ever heard of mercenaries leaving their comrades to go forth in danger while we stay back ? " <p> A Juddelan mercenary came into sight as he walked out from the shrubs . He was carrying a large black weapon , his face full of stubble along with a lop-sided grin . He shook his head as he spoke with a heavy accent . <p> Brendels group looked at him . <p> here 's someone who can walk freely out of rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Frank , assault captain . " He introduced himself as he rubbed his nose . <p> " What is that ? " Brendels gaze fell upon Franks weapon in his hand . <p> " A flintlock gun , this is my precious baby . " Frank patted his black weapon and gave a harsh laugh . <p> Brendel recognized that weapon . Abandoned mana crystal fragments were used as gunpowder , while an Element Needle was uasd as the ignition mechanism . They are the unigue firearms of this world . The Ovlans had started making guns approximately thirty years ago , and even had two squads of soldiers armed with flintlock guns ; and dating even further back the Silver Years was the Dwarves creating matchlock guns . <p> A gun was extremely powerful in close range . The best flintlock gun one could find did the same damage within forty meters as a Brass-ranked artifact . Furthermore , the gunners in this era were very familiar with the usage . The only ranged unit that might possibly outperformed it was a trained squadron of mages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Brass-ranked artifacts are Brendels wind ring and flame ring . ) <p> Many mercenaries love using firearms , especially pistols . Using a long barreled gun like this person here is rare . Even throughout the game , guns did n't  change how wars are fought , unlike my original world . Since mana crystals are limited , so is the quantity of guns . <p> Amandina felt her face burning up slightly but she maintained her vigilant attitude . " What did you mean by that ? " <p> " Its very simple . It seems that you 're following what the kingdoms army was taught to do in books . Were simple mercenaries . Regardless of whether were light or heavy infantry , the only thing we do is to fight together under any type of situation . You are not wrong in saying we should n't be here in this forest , but we need to consider reality " Frank answered in a polite tone , but it was not hard to listen to hear the indifference in his voice . <p> Amandina hiccuped once . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books was shallow , but pointing it out directly made her feel slight anger . She cast a quick glance at Brendel , and whispered quietly . <p> " Do you believe them , my lord ? " <p> Brendel looked at Frank and nodded . <p> " But- " <p> " But what ? " He asked her instead . <p> Amandinas eyes said Are you really going to believe him ? . <p> Brendel merely gave a smile and exchanged greetings with Frank and Sanford , before urging his horse to move forward . He did not give a reply to her , but her obstinate personality did not allow her to stop at that , and gave chase to him . <p> " My lord , I do n't  think these men are normal . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Instinct . " <p> " What do you say to that , little Romaine ? " Brendel said without turning his head around . <p> " I do n't  know , " Romaine shook her head : " But my aunt has said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty ! " <p> Brendel grinned when he heard her answer , and he urged his horse near Romaine and flicked her forehead . <p> " You cunning little fox . You obviously know what they are up to and yet you have to do it in such a roundabout way . " <p> " I , I really do n't  know ! " Romaines brows raised up as she quickly tried to justify herself . <p> Amandina did not know what to do in front of their flirting , but she finally understood that Brendel feigned ignorance and already suspected their motives from the start . It was finally then she relaxed . <p> " If that is the case , " Amandinas face was slightly red as she eyed both of them : " What should we do ? " <p> " Be ready to handle things as they come . " Brendel merely said . <p> He had finally recalled all the clues mentioned from the forums guide to this related quest . As long as the mercenaries were not going to create trouble for him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a headache that he did not need , the enemies that the Grey Wolves Mercenaries was about to face was going to embroil them into another new kind of trouble , but he could only blame Makarov for getting involved with such a tricky opponent . <p> Rather than calling it a fight between two groups of mercenaries , its the organization behind Paper Cards targeting the Grey Wolves Mercenaries . <p> He monitored his surroundings , taking into view of the men around him . He was not really concerned about their fates , but he was trying hard to think how he could escape from this problem . <p> What I do n't  get is how a mere mercenary group got the attention of the damnned Tree Shepherds <p> The Unifying Guilds members were like law-abiding citizens compared to them . <p> Brendel started to ponder the entire situation as a gamer . <p> Even though there 's no need to stick my hand into this beehive , its best for me to consider the outcomes . While the guide gave a walkthrough to how they handled the events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't mentioned at all . <p> He rubbed his forehead . <p> We should leave before they fight . The boss in this quest is the God Acolyte Ekman . According to lore , the name is derived from eaam , and represents verdant mountains and limitless seas as a spellword . In ancient times , there had been a gigantic creature called Ekman as well , both existing in Kirrlutzs legendary fables and mountain folklore , and represented immortality <p> Brendel shook his head . <p> The gigantic beast Ekman , is a descendant from the Titans , but the God Acolyte is nothing more a monsters name . These so called God Acolytes are nothing more than twisted abominations like the Golden Demonic Tree , and really nothing more than the product of being nurtured with the corrupted blood of a god . <p> Brendel recalled the time where he fought with the God Acolyte of Skies Amar and God Acolyte of Darkness Black lotus . The former was an incomplete form at level fifty . He had fought with it in a random encounter with his allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victorious with much difficulty . The latter was a level sixty-seven elite boss within the primary heroic quest which two guilds participated in to vanquish it . <p> The God Acolytes are terrifying because they are so much more powerful than what their level indicates . Even with an incomplete form at level fifty , they are able to match several Gold-ranked fighters at one go . I do n't  even have the slightest intention to go against this opponent Still , there 's the chance to get some advantages here . The Grey Wolves Mercenaries must have been decimated here but at the very least Makarov and Buga did n't  die . <p> Brendels mind ran through the series of possibilities as to why they survived , before it wandered to the loot that the Tree Sheperds dropped . <p> The God Acolyte of Skies drops the Spear of Blue Skies , Phana . That 's the highest tier of the Gold-ranked ( Fantasy ) weapons , allowing to ignore all physical defence . The God Acolyte of Darkness even drops a Dark Gold-ranked ( Godly ) weapon , the Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grace , a one percent chance to deal damage equivalent to the targets current life ( non-boss ) and ignores all defense . The secondary trait is Annhilation , and prevents the target from receiving any heals with a ten percent chance . <p> Even though they were immensely powerful , they were a walking treasure vault , and one could only wonder where they were able to get so many rare items . <p> " The rarest thing these God Acolytes has is actually the blood running in them All of them has the corrupted blood of gods in them . Mother Marsha above , how did they get the hands on the blood of these gods who have disappeared ? " <p> He muttered to himself . <p> After the Era of Darkness , these Gods had passed away and became constellations . The only God that was still in this world was Mother Marsha , and the world was no longer controlled by these powers . Anyone who tried to call themselves God would be a false one . <p> " What are you thinking about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thoughts . <p> Brendel shook his head and said : " The powers of the mountains . " <p> " Powers of the mountains ? " <p> TL : So about these three titles They are loan words from game of thrones and dragon age 2 , but the meaning might differ for this novel .

" The wolf boy did not understand . <p> First she lifted up the wolf boys injured arm on her shoulders , squeezed it a few times , and did not discover any signs of broken bones , so the little girl decided to apply the bandages . <p> Her actions were swift and accurate , opening up the bandages , applying the poultice and wrapping it around him .. without knocking on to his wounds at all .

Its fortunate that I have not been discovered for so long ..

The little white tiger started to circle around her feet and rubbing against it to beg for the crystal ? ! <p> Who was going to care ! <p> This was a hard year , and trying to eke a living anywhere was hard . Never mind about this primitive forest with full of magical beasts , even if it was a forest in modern Earth , there were all sorts of inconveniences and troubles . <p> The black panther was obviously the king of the hills here , and Sue believed that she was not as capable . <p> Right now the cruel reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too low right now . The black panther probably would not get any stronger in this lifetime , but right now at this very moment . It was undoubtedly many times stronger than her right now ! <p> After analyzing it realistically , Sue thought that she it was necessary to live off a magical beast at this current stage like a leech . <p> She did not even hope to be like a Tueee protagonist in like some Japanese Cheat Novels , showing off some GAR aura just by yelling My Bone My Sword , and attracting ten of thousands of magical beasts prostrating at her feet . ( TL : Not the exact literal translation . ) <p> Sue only had one simple wish , she just hoped that she did not end up as a nutritional meal in this forest <p> Right now , the relationship between the black panther and her was not based on enmity .

There was even a roasting spit ready to be used , and the only thing left to do was to serve him up .. <p> The wolf boys expression was one of utter dismay and hurt . But this was a normal reaction , anyone who knows that they had fallen into a trap with their life at stake , would look like the wolf boy now . <p> " You .. intend to hand me over to these magical beasts ? ! " He licked his dry lips . Even though he felt that he had lost too much blood and could not last much longer , he still gritted his teeth and blocked the road to the tree . His whole body was tense , and his eyes were narrowed into slits . The hands that were hidden behind his back opened up and the sharp fingernails extended out instantly , ready for action . <p> The wolves felt their leaders emotions , and slowly surrounded them with low growls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed off completely . <p> The young girl pouted once , and looked at the tense muscular outline of the youth in front of her . She glanced at the wolves behind him Were they treating her like an idiot ! It would be strange not to notice such an obvious enmity from them . <p> " Are you trying to betray your savior who directed you to a place of safety ? ! " Sue asked sincerely . <p> " Sorr . " The wolf boy paused , then blushed a little as he nearly apologized . He suddenly realized she was trying to secretly change the topic . <p> The place that she directed to might not be a place of safety , at the very least the situation right now looked like she was leading the wolves to the slaughter or something The wolf boys face became serious and turned his anger into blame : " You dwarven race have betrayed the trust of the half-beasts ! " ( TL : A pun on wolf-related words from the original raws . English pun TL Like a lamb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) <p> " .. " Who told you your queen was a dwarf .. Sue nearly fell to the ground with her face flat on it . If this wolf boy did not reveal his true thoughts , she really did not know he actually classified her as a dwarf . <p> She should just *Meow* his *Woof* ! <p> " You have nothing to say for yourself now ! " The wolf boy brought her to justice , exposing her miscarriage of justice , and delivered a poetic jus . ( TL : Many chinese idioms on him being in the right and honorable . ) <p> " " It was not that she had nothing to say for herself , the issue was they were of different races , and there seemed to be a great misunderstanding here Sues little fat arm shot up sharply to her temple and rubbed the throbbing vein back down . <p> It looked like she had been too lonely in the forest for too long . She was fortunate enough to find someone who could speak , and she really did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was something like when she was in the game , she would have gave him an uppercut and left this bird wolfbrain alone . <p> Just when she was silent , the little white tiger raised his paw and patted Sues short legs , " Meow , meow " , after a few cries , he pointed his claw at a specific direction <p> She saw that there was a series of movements from within the foliage , and a familiar black round head popped up from it . There was a pair of glowing , golden yellow eyes at the center of that black round head . It was especially conspicuous . <p> " " Sue continued to be speechless . Wonderful , even the boss among the elite magical beast bosses was here , and they directly skipped to the final level . <p> Waves of despair struck at the wolf boy . Even though he was still willing to battle , he was not stupid . This black panther was clearly the one that led a group of high ranking magical beasts to attack him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other beasts were nearby . With it in front of him , and the forbidden area that he could not cross behind him . Even if he was not injured , the possibility of escaping alive was small . <p> At this critical juncture , the little girl sighed and stood out in front of the wolf boy : " Blackie-bro , wolf meat actually does n't  taste nice Plus I already made friends with him , even if you kill him right here , I would n't have the heart to roast him " <p> The black panther slowly walked towards them , with a wild boar on its tail .. <p> " Blam ! " It threw the wild boar into the safety zone with its tail . After pausing for a while , it swayed its tail and turned around , went to tree and jumped to its usual spot , closed its eyes and started to nap . <p> The wolf boy was startled when he saw the loli suddenly blocking him from the panther with her body . He was still under pressure from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree to show that it let him off . He finally sighed with relief , felt his body turn to jelly , and nearly collapsed straight onto the ground . <p> The wolves whimpered and gathered around him . They stopped surrounding Sue and the little white tiger , and every one of them rushed to the wolf boys side , using their fluffy body to rub him in order to get- fawned upon and support from him . <p> " Thanks ! " The wolf boy raised one of his leg up while he sat on the ground . He rested for a while and cautiously thanked Sue : " I misunderstood you . " <p> " Theres no need to be polite , no matter what , you have already paid me . " Sue smiled : " But even though Blackie-bro is willing to spare you , that does n't  mean the other magical beasts are willing to do the same Its his turn today to get the roasted meat , but if its another magical beast tomorrow , you might not be so lucky . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get along with the magical beasts in this forest ? ! " <p> " Just a little , just a little , we are only on a mutual-benefit basis . Since they want to make use of me and are able to get their food supply from elsewhere , they would naturally lose the reason to hunt me right ? " <p> " Then do you know why they wanted to join up and attack me ? ! " The wolf boy frowned , showing that he did not understand why this happened . <p> The higher ranked magical beasts were not on friendly terms , and acted on their own half the time . There were only a few cases where they would join up and fight together , for example , a very powerful enemy that they could not handle alone , or a creature that drew the ire of the entire magical beasts . Before he set off , he had heard that only the necromancers undead army had this treatment . <p> " Actually , you 're overthinking things . My guess is they are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The wolf boy was at a loss for words : " What do you mean ? ! " <p> Was this girl treating him like an idiot again ? ! <p> The dwarven race actually chose to insult the half-beasts intelligence in this manner .. <p> " Its like this , because everyone was on a rotational schedule for the roasted meat , their chances to talk civilly had increased , and after a while , their tense relationship started to relax .. And they seemed to have eaten a lot more for the past few months and they were starting to get fat . So they were putting in effort recently to exercise , and even before you came , they actually split up into groups and fought each other .. " <p> If it was in the past , invaders who barged into the forest would encounter against magical beasts in charge of their own territory . The magical beast would simply fight to either win as a victor , or was defeated and vanquished . But it was different now , everyone was friendly with each other , and they needed the exercise .

Ill update 1 or 2 more chapters soon I hope . <p> TL : So before you start reading the chapter , I just want to say that Danganronpa is out . This is one of the best mystery visual novels ( novel + voiced lines + graphics ) you can get right now if you have n't played it before . Some of you might not know this , but I first came from the visual novel side before translating webnovels . I highly recommend this game . <p> After Sue threw the hastily made heating bag and fish soup at the prince , she went straight to bed . She could not care any more whether the chibi would continue to sneak out .. Why did she need to spend effort to save a moron who was going to get himself killed sooner or later if he still did not understand what situation he is in ? ! <p> The night passed by quietly . <p> When Sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prince sleeping soundly in the beast hide blanket with satisfaction . <p> Good . At least he has some hope and is n't a senseless idiot ! <p> She got up and jumped down from the tree house , and went to the river to wash up . She went out for a stroll with the tiger beside her , and she hunted a deer when she returned on the way . Once she entered the safety zone , she saw the little prince who was looking down from the treehouse . <p> " Come down . Wash up and prepare to have your meal . " Sue beckoned to him : " Then we will talk about your problems . " <p> " I cant . " The little prince nearly cried . He was nearly five to six meters up , and he was definitely going to die from the jump , definitely . <p> " Xiao Bai , get that brat down .

" The little tiger who was playing by himself immediately came over and meowed twice , and received a few fruits and he happily went away with them . <p> Fedrus held the fruit for a long time . He was conflicted because he was to proud to just simply accept her things , but despite this , it was true that he was hungry . The fish soup had already been digested a long time ago .

" <p> The little princes face immediately turned : " I cant eat so much .. " <p> " Besides you and me , there are others as well . " Sue sighed . Every kid was a natural chatterbox as they had endless questions that they want an answer to . <p> " Who else ? " <p> " Be good , this matter has nothing to do with you !

After receiving a full nights worth of fright he was still very much a coward at heart , but on the surface he did improve a lot . <p> " Are they all your pets ? " The little prince looked at the magical beast who threw its prey at the receiving Sue , showing off his envy naively . <p> It was everyones dream to get a strong magical beast as its pet . This was mostly pride more than their useful prowess in battles . <p> The beast could raised the partys strength by several folds , accompany its master to any dangerous corner in the continent , and even act as a mount .

He turned gloomy and looked at the little white tiger pawing at the worms on the ground , then looked at the loli who was shorter than him by half a head , then pouted with annoyance : " That is true , how would a little girl like you have such an amazing beast . This cat still suits you . " Even though it can fly and becoming big , its still a cat . <p> The cat seemed like it stumbled over a rock and rolled twice on the ground . It stood up with grass and dirt on his head , and meowed at Sue to complain and express his hurt . <p> " ..

" Sue nodded : " Go ahead and contract with them ! " Your own dream should be caught with your own hands . Go forth for it kiddo , step bravely into the lands of the dead ! <p> " You 're not helping me ? ! " <p> " How am I supposed to help you ?

Wait till you go back to the palace , ask your father to send a thousand elite wizards and warriors to follow you , and contract the ones that you like .. You can even contract two magical beasts , with your left leg riding on one while your right leg rides on the other " This was the authority of the prince . <p> " .. But I want to become strong now .

" This prince kept trying to be a knight more than a knight could ever be , how were these knights going to live properly if the bar is set too high ? ! <p> Of course , the little princes insistence on this might be due to the inheritance issue . Under the same circumstances where he has the same conditions , the chance to inherit the kingdom would be greater , although if he eliminated his opponents then there was no need to worry . Sue was actually quite similar to the mastermind who tried to assassinate Fedrus . <p> There 's really no need to think about it .

Secondly , Fedrus was interested in the ones that had high intelligence . It was possible to kill them , but making them submit unless there was some mind control involve , otherwise this high fantasy was pretty much impossible . <p> After explaining , the merfolk left to do their business . They came here to investigate with a magical stone to fully analyze the tree in the safety zone , and did not have the time to soothe a childs unsatisfied attitude .

It gives me insight to the human soul ! <p> JK . <p> So I assume the people who voted others means that this series resembles korean novels and their VRMMORPG protagonists counterparts ? - Maybe its because of Brendel stealing the spider ring from the necromancer and his love for loot 8 ) <p> Im surprised that the choice JP novel got the highest votes , although I cant tell if its because of my TL style or because the plot sounds like JP stuff . Maybe it resembles Log Horizon in some ways ? Hmm . <p> So Western novel . At first when I read the first few chapters and skimmed through the later ones , I thought its going to be a bit like game of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the beginning , but the development of epic plot is slow here . Do n't  get me wrong , I still think there 's a presence of dragons and dungeons influence , and I 'm enjoying the journey the protagonist is having , but its a little different than what I expected . I spent a considerable amount of time thinking about name translations , gosh , the amount of names.swoon . Chinese novels received a pretty warm reception with 14.5% . I personally thought its going to be one of the lowest because its missing that flavor text of You do n't  know mount tai ! or Youre seeking death ! or *insert reference to face* or the time of 1 joss stick or time of a few breaths or the time to empty 1 teacup of tea . Lol . <p> Despite the nice story here , its a fact that CN web-novelists get paid by the amount of words they put into each chapter , and I feel like they are writing against a deadline in many chapters . So this is the only part where I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons &gt;&gt; . <p> If you are able to read the raws without relying on MTL , you might find that there 's a fair bit of difference in the writing style and its in need of an editor like all other webnovels . If you MTL the series , then I 'll just warn you guys again that I edit the series heavily . Plot is generally intact , but do n't  get confused if you see all sorts of small details missing or added in . <p> I rewrote the sloppy areas , removed filler words as much as I could and added details to most of the major fights . Hopefully the story is polished and presented with a stylistic flair in English . I expect to edit it even further some day in 2017/18 . <p> Mixture of the great three ( JP , CN , Eng ) .

This creature that was clad in a rock armor had uncountable needle-like teeth shaped like a whirlpool for its mouth , easily passing through the earth and tearing up the hardest rocks . <p> He had seen a mature Rock Wurm in the game before . It was thirty meters long and there had to be at least three people to surround and fight it . The defense of the creature was astonishingly high , even a 40 OZ Vran Sword was not be able to pierce through the rock armor and do damage . <p> Damn it . Two sounds . If the BOSS causes the Rock Wurm to take a long detour , its attention would be on us again . <p> The roots of the Golden Demonic Tree in the forbidden valley extended nearly a kilometer , and factoring in the Rock Wurms fastest speed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thirty seconds to burst out of the ground . <p> Were nearly at the center of the Forbidden Garden . Once we finish bypassing this uneven ground , we would be able to reach the main body of the Golden Demonic Tree . If this BOSS does not interfere with us , that is . <p> There was two minutes left . <p> But he knew that the Golden Demonic Tree would definitely try and stop them . Before he finished his thoughts , there were crackling noises coming from the solid ground . They were in such close vicinity of the Golden Demonic Tree that its actions came without warning , and Romaine was unable to warn him in time . <p> The three of them felt the ground sink before them , and the prepared Brendel stabbed the ground with the Elven sword to support himself , while his other hand prevented the merchant girl from falling down . When he looked to the sides , Freya was half kneeling on the ground as she tried to steady herself . <p> Before the three of them had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a crack visibly forming before them . <p> " What is it trying to do ? " Freya nearly fell backwards and asked uneasily . <p> " Its trying to kill us , concentrate and follow me .

The roots emerged from the ground and struck her across the chest . If it was not for Brendels swift reactions to pull her back , she would have fallen into the crevice along with the rocks and mud . <p> " Thanks . " Freya shrugged his hand off and thanked him . <p> " Now is not the time for words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incoming vine whip into two . " Move ahead . Were nearly at the tree . " <p> There were snake-like tree vines appearing in front of them when they finally reached in front of the BOSS . The crevice behind them was gradually becoming bigger , but Brendel was used to this scene . <p> You might have given me a surprise during the first stage but it looks like you have ran out of tricks . <p> The ability in the game was an extensive AOE attack to rip open the ground , but that did not mean it could not be countered . <p> " Look carefully ! " <p> He shouted to Freya while holding on tightly to Romaine . He watched the vines carefully , letting the whip pass by , then grabbed tightly onto it <p> The Golden Demonic Tree apparently did not expect that . It tried to curl up the vine and shook it back and forth , trying to throw Brendel away . <p> But the youth held tightly onto it with one arm . Both Romaine and him bobbed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was a futile attempt . The BOSS finally got impatient and raised the vine up high , gathering momentum , managing to throw him backwards . Yet he utilized the momentum from the swing and landed thirty meters away from the crevice safely . <p> His high stats in strength allowed him to possess four times the strength of a normal human , while his nimble agility allowed him to handle the trees sudden movements , and his robust physique allowed him to absorb the impact . If it was a normal person , their internal organs would have ruptured from the landing , but Brendel only felt slightly unused to the feeling when he landed . <p> This was the advantages of having high stats , and he knew that everything he did had meaning to it when he landed safely . <p> He immediately shouted to Freya : " Follow me ! " <p> He pulled the merchant girl along without stopping , heading towards the Golden Demonic Tree . <p> " Brendel , wait I cant catch up . " <p> But he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the ground suddenly erupted in front of him with a crashing sound when he turned at a corner . Numerous vines sprang forth to form a web , covering the Golden Demonic Tree . <p> Shit ! There 's less than one minute left . <p> Brendel paused for a moment , while Romaine gasped for breath behind him . She looked up at the tree in front of her ; no matter how she looked at it , its appearance looked like a Golden Apple Tree made by the gods . <p> He studied the web carefully . It appeared to be identical to the game . The countless vines wiggled for a moment before they attacked him at the same time . <p> With a roar , Brendel unleashed his attacks without reservations , the Elven sword flashing with a phantasmal silver fire in a blinding speed . Each of his slashes accurately severed the numerous vines that assaulted him in succession into halves , which in turn burst up into flames and turned to ashes . Then he released Romaine and took a step backwards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Power Break ! " <p> One step forward . <p> Brendel felt an overwhelming strength spreading from his shoulders to his arms and hands , and he sundered the web in front of him in a beautiful silver arc . The blade seemed to compress the air from two sides , forcing a screaming explosion of wind to sing from the sword . The web of overflowing vines broke apart like a sea of rotten firewood , and there was a large depression from the center of the web . <p> Freya staggered across the uneven ground and rushed towards the tree from behind , where she managed to see this scene in front of her . She always thought she had seen his limits every single time when he was in action , but this was the first time she saw him using this explosive power . <p> The Golden Demonic Tree was unable to block them any longer , and could only watch them break into the heart of the garden . <p> " The two of you attack the trunk and roots and I 'll attack the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fate , and spoke in his heart : " Activate the Holy Sword ! " <p> . <p> Even in the summer time , the Silver Claw Fortress was still covered by a layer of frost . It was built on the Corcov mountains in order to oversee the savages in the forest . But after the Balta province was built , it was used as one of the royal familys villa . <p> There was an ancient pine tree in the fortresss diamond shaped garden . It had miraculously survived from a fire within the Silver Claw Fortress , and the owner thought it was a good omen . Thus the tree was kept after the fortress was rebuilt . <p> And under this pine tree , a solemn atmosphere extended from it . <p> A adolescent girl was standing there in a thick uniform of the knights . She had beautiful silver hair , and her half pointed ears proved that she had another bloodline beyond a human , but she did not have the elegance and aloof beauty of an elf . <p> The fifteen-year-old girl wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heavy longsword with both her hands . Her stance took on the form of an Aouines knights defensive posture . <p> She pursed her lips tightly , ordering the younger boy in front of him : " Haruze , attack me ! " <p> A tone that denied any refusals . <p> " Older sis . " <p> " Attack ! " <p> The young boy could only force himself to strike with the sword . But the girl cleanly parried his blade and pushed his chest with one hand , making him fall straight onto the ground . <p> The surrounding servants audibly breathed inwardly . <p> " Again ! " The girls expression did not change as she spoke . <p> " Sister , I .. " <p> " Stand up , again . " <p> The boy could only stand up . He took one step backwards , before gritting his teeth and charging over again . But the girl with the knights uniform passed the sword from her right hand to her left and simply swung upwards , easily knocking her opponents sword away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sorry . " <p> " Again . " <p> <p> Ten minutes later . <p> The young girl went to the dressing room . She allowed two maidservants to remove her heavy uniform . Her perspiration and hot air were visibly seen in the cold air . She did not turn her head and simply asked : " Where is my father ? " <p> " The Madaras envoy has arrived , your royal highness . " <p> " His majesty is meeting Marquis Kluge in the secret meeting room . " Another maidservant replied with her head lowered . <p> The girl looked at herself in the mirror . Her face was cold and void of expression . She changed into a dress , inserted her hand into her long silver hair and sent it backwards . She raised her head and said : <p> " Bring me to Gammel . " She had thought there would be a chance to turn the battle around , but the wily Marquis Kluge was someone who could not be trusted . She had to find a trustworthy confidant to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Yes , your royal highness . " <p> This was the beginning of June in the year of bustling summer leaves and flowers . <p> . <p> Brendel looked at the Golden Demonic Trees branches which were gradually losing its color . They weakly drooped down and he knew this terrifying monster had reached the end of its life . He felt mentally tired . He had paid two EP to maintain the holysword , and that effect seemed to have affected his mind as well . <p> He was a warrior and not a wizard . Even then , a specialized wizard at his level would only have ten plus EP . <p> Freya and Romaine sat down at one side with their stamina completely drained . Freya had injured her arm a little but she was otherwise fine . In comparison , they were delighted to have defeated an impossible foe . <p> Both of them looked curiously as they saw Brendel walking forward to the Golden Demonic Tree . <p> Power Break ! <p> He swung the Elven Sword across the trunk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than an oak tree now , and it was unable to resist Brendels 7.7 OZ worth of strength . The meteoric strike tore the upper body of the tree away and it splintered everywhere as it crashed onto the ground . <p> The girls called out in surprise , not understanding what he was doing . <p> Brendel knew that the Golden Demonic Tree hung its dead preys on the trees crown and slowly absorbed the mana from them . Despite the passing years , there might be some loot on it . <p> Brendel walked over and he saw a card on the floor with his first glance . <p> Chapter 39 The death of the Golden Tree <p> TL : You read that right . Not Golden Demonic Tree , but Golden Tree . Since the title for this chapter has spoilers , I have shifted it =X <p> It probably received bad reviews at novelupdates at first because of two things : 1 ) Its chinese , but does n't  have xianxia annoyances . People who enjoyed xianxia and read this expecting to see another xianxia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heaven references likely felt disappointed and gave lower marks out of spite . Those who were more neutral likely held back from giving points and waited for more chapters . 2 ) The MCs name . I mean , good lord , his name is Sophie . I have a girlfriend named Sophie lol Its hard to imagine him as anything other than a girly guy with a name like Sophie = <p> There 's a huge fan base for YY novels ( the completely over-power MC murdering any who he feels is unjust ) and they are even picky about their Xianxia only wanting novels that provide them with a quick cathartic release and maintain high levels of tension ( typically at the expense of plot or character development ) . Well written stories without constant fights ( World of Cultivation , Zi Tian Ji , etc. ) get huge amounts of negative comments from these people complaining about pace and lack of action despite being better stories in nearly every way to the mainstream YY novels . Unless of course you only want mindless action . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt , even in traditional print there is a huge market for poorly written action series ( largely in the young male market ) . A lot of these books make it onto best seller list . Same goes for stuff like Twilight . This stuff is popular and people who like it typically do n't  like better written books because they find them hard to read . <p> So take all reviews with a grain of salt . People take their preconceptions and expectations with them when they read a novel and if the novel strays from what they think should happen , the majority of people dislike this . <p> I 'm quite enjoying this series . I had n't  read it till now due to the massive amount of web-novels I 'm trying to read but I think the translation is good and its more interesting than most VRMMO novels . <p> There 's a distinct difference between your style of translating for TAS and STBGAM . The latter feels like chinese wuxia while the former feels a little more like it translates into english well , thus the japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream , I felt it had a strong western influence . Japanese and Chinese may use dialogue during fights but that 's usually talk-no-jutsu at best and the conversation is often meaningless . <p> In western novels , even in the young men demographic , action is sub-servant to dialogue . You would n't think that looking at our moves but conflict is more subtle than in japanese or chinese novels . They are more like violent arguments than fights , and the flow of the fight usually reflects who is winning the argument . The fights often come down to , not the characters strength or will , but how justified or panicked they fill at the given time . <p> Basically , I find that western novels are more about dialogue and less about actionwhich is sometimes good and sometimes disappointing . <p> I voted Japanese because if compared to other japanese stories I read they have a lot in common , also because there is not much blood in it . In those wuxia novels if someone looks at you wrong , you kill them XD . The way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my choice ; p . Well , either way , its a great novel ! The origin does n't  matter , as long as its great I will read it ! Wahahahahaha ! XD Thanks for all the hard work ! <p> Western . The whole synopsis of a white knight out to save the kingdom is just so typically Western to me that I just cant understand how people argue otherwise . I agree that there were elements of Japanese and Chinese ( the dragging on of the fight for word count and the use of cards ) but I just have to go with Western . <p> You have much thanks for your effort in this . I 'm am glad to know that you put in such effort , it makes all the difference . As for the story it is great as it does not promote a sense of deja vu of having seen it before . The efforts of the character are solid in its struggle , instead of being handed all the answers and be given cheats like a rapists dick down the throat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wrapped up conveniently . The pacing is also just fine and the entire thing about pacing is fucking stupid . Life goes up and down . Struggles do n't  happen all the time and the characters as people need to eat , talk , sleep , dream . conveniently not poop &gt;. &gt; settle their debts , take a break or just sit down for a spot of tea . <p> Its kind of a good point but that 's volume 1s cover and we are at chapter 39 . I 'm more inclined to think that the artist made a mistake in the hair color , than to think that its the half-elven princess . <p> i agree with u , the cover is ugly as hell so for THAT i can say the novel it is not chinese lol , at least they are not using niether of the studios that draws their manwha/comic/manga w/e they are even if it feels wordy as hell the cover breaks the idea of it been chinese so at worst i say it is a japanese trying to make a xian xian world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story/plot and i love the setting . plus the translatoin is above average ( sure you make a couple of mistakes here and there , but its easy to read which is most important.as of why i think that the novel might not be rated higher than it is , i think its because the story feels sooo very slow i mean this arc nicely displays it 6 chapters for the death of a tree . ( i think not even LMS uses that many chapters for one opponent . ) <p> The following are suggestions for changes . Please ignore them , if you disagree . === === The defense of the creature was astonishingly high , even a 40 OZ Vran Sword was not be able to pierce through the rock armor and do damage . <p> should be : <p> The defense of the creature was astonishingly high , even a 40 OZ Vran Sword was not able to tear through the rock armor and do damage . === === There were snake-like tree vines appearing in front of them when they finally reached in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were snake-like tree vines appearing in front of them when they finally arrived in front of the BOSS . === === You might have given me a surprise during the first stage but it looks like you have ran out of tricks . <p> should be : <p> You might have given me a surprise during the first stage but it looks like you have run out of tricks . <p> I 'm in more of a Korean novel . Though I have read only four Korean novels so far ( I am the Monarch , LMS , Dungeon Defense and Release the Witch ) I consider it as one because of : <p> 1 . ) Extremely slow but brief and concise pacing , 2 . ) No tropes nor cliches yet , even the lucky pervert scene is written differently , that instead of the mc " slipping " he made its that its the females fault , and it did not mention any tsundere lines yet for Freya , in which in JP novel she already have said " its not like I 'm doing this for you or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cliches . And I mean REALLY HEAVILY ITS ANNOYING . <p> Yes , Dungeon Defense and Release that Witch are Korean novels , at least I consider them as such . Dungeon Defense follows the standard light novel format ( with great anime Illustrations ) but that 's it . Its so freakin original and so good I thought " were all Korean novels like this ? Its so damn original and good I want more ! That was my first korean novel btw . Release the witch is a novel written in chinese but the author is a Korean . Korean novels do n't  stick to cliches . 
@@37042352 @6042352/ <h> The Amber Sword Ch 8 <p> The young man who was controlled by the necromancer paled even further with a shudder , his shame and fear made him bowed his head deeply . <p> But no one would want to die , right ? <p> Freya felt like her heart was going to stop any moment , and her hand reached to her sword without thinking . But the necromancer immediately dismissed her notion to draw it . The green lights in its eye sockets flared up , and that young mans arm exploded like a balloon . Blood and flesh sprayed everywhere , and he screamed loudly , falling down and curling into a heap . <p> " Gaaahhh ! Please save me captain ! ! ! " <p> The bloody Jonathon rolled on the ground , shrieking in horror . <p> This frightening scene made a few people turned away and threw up . Freya turned white and stumbled backwards , nearly collapsing into a heap . <p> " Little human girl , it is best that you do not move rashly . " The necromancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeping across everyone who was there . <p> But it soon discovered there were only some militia here , maggots that were not worth mentioning . <p> The green lights in the necromancers eye sockets dimmed with disappointment . It had received orders to pursue and kill the human scout , and not to squabble over these maggots . <p> Freyas mind was a complete blank , but she tried to shake off the waves of dizziness that were assaulting her . She tried her best to mull over the way to escape from this situation . She still remembered that she was the the leader of the militia and could not easily show her weak side to the enemy . <p> As for the girl that was beside Romaine , she had fainted at the first sight of Jonathons bloody fate . It was fortunate that the merchant girl was there to hold her . <p> Sophie felt one of Romaines hand grabbing on to his sleeve tightly . It was a sign that she trusted and depended on him . <p> He had earlier held Freya from behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she surprised him with her strong resolution . <p> But no matter what , he knew that she needed some assurance at this time , or she might break down mentally . A girl who lived in a peaceful era would find it difficult to endure a cruel scene like this . It was perhaps fortunate that many young men and women were prepared for wars to break out , as Aouine was a country that was stricken with the ravages of war . <p> " Freya . " Sophie whispered weakly . <p> The young girl paused for a while and woke up from her stupor . She breathed deeply , and calmed down bit by bit under Sophies presence . He nodded in admiration when her fingers on her swords hilt relaxed . <p> This achievement could be considered to be exceptional . Very few people would be able to calm down when facing the thin line separating life and death . <p> Although he did not understand why , his own heart seemed to be as serene as it could possibly be , after experiencing the parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regardless , it was definitely a good thing . <p> He continued to whisper : " Do you remember what I said earlier , about planning for the worst ? " <p> Freya froze for a moment and nodded slightly . <p> " Do you have the strength to fight ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> It was a reply that almost could not be heard . <p> Sophies heart was relieved . <p> He rubbed against the Ring of the Wind Empress with his thumb , and the sensation he felt told him that it was half recharged . <p> Three hours to restore a segment of energy compared to ten minutes in the game , it was certainly too slow , but it was sufficient at half capacity . Even though it was unable to create a wind bullet , it was able to create a powerful whirlwind . <p> Since he was prepared for the worst outcome , there was nothing else that could go wrong . <p> At the same time , the necromancer was finally convinced there was no ambush here . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was crying beside its feet , and raised its skeletal arm : <p> " My soldiers , slay every one here ! " <p> The ear-piercing , dry voice rang out , and there were four skeleton soldiers wearing black heavy armor wielding sharp swords that immediately came out from the forest . Their bodies made clacking noises as they walked through the swirling mist , approaching closer to the militia with every step . <p> If it was a little earlier , the militia might still have the courage to resist the undead soldiers , but it was different now . The confidence they had earlier was shattered by the inhuman necromancer , and the remaining bravery they had were crushed by the approaching soldiers , with no strength left to fight back . <p> They could only retreat backwards in terror . Some drew out their swords shakily from an instinctive will to survive , but there was no certainty as to how much they could defend themselves . <p> There were only quickened breaths echoing throughout the forest . <p> The necromancer crackled in laughter as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sockets danced wildly , as if they were savoring the fear . <p> It was certainly true that fear was humans greatest weakness , and it could easily be made use of . In comparison , the undead naturally overcame this weakness . Every one of them was the finest soldier , especially the lower ranked undead that did not even need to think and simply obeyed their orders . <p> Even veteran soldiers could be as helpless as a child in a battlefield , and weak creatures like them should not continue to exist in this world . <p> The necromancer felt only hatred for them : Without a doubt , Madara must be victorious <p> But at this moment , it heard the faintest whisper : " Then I 'll leave it to you . " <p> A calm youthful voice brimming with confidence . <p> The necromancer felt its Souls Fire jumped a little . It was a bad omen , and the necromancer turned its head warily . <p> A shining ring entered into its line of sight . <p> The ring was worn on that heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this human who was half dead , indeed , what was there to note ? <p> Pretending to be heavily injured might fool others , but they would not be able to deceive an undead . These cold creatures that climbed out from the graves can perceive the Flames of Life directly , and there was no mistaking Sophies faint flames . <p> He was definitely heavily injured . <p> The true threat came from the magic ring on his thumb . The green lights in the necromancers eye sockets suddenly dimmed , as it could suddenly feel a dangerous aura gathering in the air . <p> The necromancer had came into contact with fake replicas of powerful artifacts when its master had taught it black magic , and from that aura emitted in the air , the ring had to be at least twenty OZ . <p> An artifact that could only belonged to a high wizard , why would it appear in the hands of a normal human ? <p> The necromancer showed an expression that was full of surprise and greed . <p> " My undead soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me ! " It raised its bone wand and screamed . <p> " Oss . " <p> But Sophie raised his right hand and spat out the word with all his strength , as if to expel all the air in his lungs . The youth fell backwards , and his head was full of cold perspiration . <p> The space between them expanded visibly , then violently contracted . <p> The distortion in the air rapidly reverted back to normalcy with an explosion , and the blast of frenzied wind roared with a thunderous boom . The wind was like a tempest of sharpened arrows piercing through the necromancer and the skeleton soldiers . They tried raising their arms to protect themselves , but the rampaging whirlwind made them stagger to their sides . <p> There was no damage done , but the impeding effect was easily visible . <p> " Freya ! " Sophie shouted . <p> The girls long sword sang in response as she drew it out , her long ponytail dancing behind her figure . <p> What amazed Sophie was how the inexperienced girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but turned her head and yelled at the rest of the militia : " Mackie , Irene ! What the hell are you waiting ! ? The third squad , soldiers of Bucce , follow me into battle ! ! ! " <p> The burst of courage was like a signal , and simple words in a battle between life and death , could become a suggestion that brought about limitless strength . <p> But this needed one condition , and that was composure . <p> A single persons composure would affect even more people , just like what was happening now . Freyas reminder startled them , but they immediately recognized this was the final chance at surviving . <p> The raging winds continued to force the enemy back without being able to do anything . <p> When the young militia discovered this , they quickly regained their mettle and the sounds of swords being drawn out reverberated in the forest . It was as if their discipline learned from the days spent in training returned to their bodies . <p> " Mackie , cover me . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Kill that foul witch first ! " <p> " Thats a necromancer . " <p> " Little fenix , you 're behind me . " <p> But Sophie looked worriedly at the chaotic battlefield . He was afraid of someone acting rashly and ruining the situation , and he reminded them calmly : " Everyone , remember what you had learned in training ! You can only fight well if you remain cool-headed ! " <p> In the online game The Amber Sword , he had seen many hot blooded newbies , acting the same way like the youths here . <p> It was good to be heated , but they must not lose their rationality . <p> He recited the militia combat regulations . It was something everyone here had recited before , but there were not many who could keep these tedious but valuable rules in mind during a battle . <p> Brendel was someone unusual , Sophie thought to himself . <p> Sophie played back Brendels final battle in his mind . As a new soldier , Brendels performance could not have been more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sword . Unfortunately , he was in the wrong place and at the wrong time . <p> The young militia who heard Sophies reminded made them levelheaded . But it was not sufficient , as Sophie knew they needed more confidence instilled in them , otherwise their regained morale would plummet back to nothing . <p> The wind started to weaken . <p> The skeleton soldiers shook their rattling armor and tried to find their balance , preparing to fight back , but Sophies voice already instructed the militia to change their tactics . <p> " Listen well . These low ranked Madaras soldiers lack intelligence and move slowly . Their greatest weakness presents itself when they turn their body . Do your utmost to follow their sword hand and move towards the left . They have a blind spot there and you can attack safely " <p> " Mackie , partner up with Irene and attack from both sides . Do you know how to cover her ? Good , attract the attention of that skeleton , keep up that pace . " <p> Sophie laid half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battlefields situation , and instructed them on their next move . It was almost as if his words carried a magic , bringing strength , composure and calmness to the young militia . <p> The Bucces militia were quickly rewarded . Erik broke a skeletons thigh bone from slashing its leg from Sophies directions , and his partner , little Fenix pierced through the skeletons skull as a follow up . <p> The instant the sword pierce through the skull , the undead creature seemed to let out a gasping sound , the Souls Fire in its eye sockets flickered and quickly died . <p> Sophies eyes caught a gold light flying into his chest from the skeleton . <p> Sophie paused for a moment . It was different from the previous time , he clearly felt the experience points clearly . But he did not have time to relish that fact , as he heard the excited yells from the militias victory . <p> " Heavens , I did it ! " Erik could not believe it and yelled as he held his bleeding wounds firmly : " Brendel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> Brendel gave a small smile . His experience came from within the game where he analyzed the enemies with his allies . Even knowing what the smallest gesture meant came from harsh lessons , knowledge that was attained from thousands of battles and deaths in the game . <p> Bucces militia had also learned similar knowledge from their training , but they were merely superficial in Sophies eyes . If Bucces training raised his prowess against the skeleton soldiers by 10% , then his own knowledge would raise beyond 50% . <p> From the 375th year until the 2nd era , the frequent battles against Madara had made Sophie completely familiar with their lowest ranked skeleton soldiers , to the highest ranked demonic witches , vampire lords and even bone dragons . <p> There was no one in Aouine who understood the undead kingdom more than him , and perhaps even the entire continent . After all , the kingdoms in this continent , prior to the first War of the Black Rose , did not have as many intense conflicts with Madara as compared to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world was one of his proudest accomplishments . He relied heavily on his knowledge , and it was the only reason that he had the confidence to keep walking down the path to where he once stood before . <p> He had to finish this task at hand first .

I 'm kind of disappointed with the foxs lips because its really uneven and embedded too deep , would definitely pay more to get it perfect . These are really so incredibly adorable and fluffy that I feel myself glowing with childish happiness when I hug them . At their size , one is not enough for an adult , you need two of them for reasonable hug feelz . <p> Workmanship is reasonable , they are stable on four paws ( able to sit up ) and appear to be in proportion ( no weird head issues ) . The flaw would be the " lips " and some finer details . Since I bought them at around 12-16 USD each , I 'm not complaining . Would buy again to gift to someone else later . <p> Look at it from another angle . For example , a shark and a whale PK-ed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how crazy it got , did it concern the humans who were living on the land at all ? ! ( TL : PK directly written in English . ) <p> In any case , on this continent , there would be only one race who would care about the other races especially when it came to a human child , without a doubt , its the merfolk race . <p> As to why the team leader did not care as much when it came to Sue ? ! This reason was actually very simple , and the very same reason why Ash admired the little miss Where exactly did this child appear to be a child ? ! <p> This little crook ! The team leader silently swallowed down a mouth of blood when he saw that Sue did not move at all , and asked again in frustration : <p> " Are you able to save him or not ? ! He s only a child ..

Even though I do n't  really know the market prices for the fabric here , but the clothes are made from silk threads that are excellent in channeling mana , which in turn enable them to present a natural magic effect . No matter how you look at it , they are only worn by nobles . " <p> In the first place , it was difficult to obtain a ream of silk threads with good magic capabilities . Not only did it have to be tough , the mana within the thread had to be stable , then it could finally be suitable to be used as a material for clothes . It was a small matter if the clothes were easily frayed , but if the mana was affected by outside influence and led astray , then the person wearing the material would not get away with just a small injury . <p> The next point was , even if the silk thread could be produced , weaving it into a cloth was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar with sigils and magic formations instructing the weaver , and it was even possible that it was a higher ranked magician who weaved it with their own hands .. It did not matter if it was a magic sigil or formation , this delicate task did not allow for any mistakes . <p> In the game , creating clothes like these was simply done with just a button push , and a matter of waiting for the message to load . The system would indicate whether it was a success or failure . <p> But doing something like this in reality , as estimated by Sue , a meter of this type of cloth required at least half a month And this excluded the time required for testing .. <p> She believed that the number of magicians in this world could not compare to the game , because any single player could simply choose whether they want to become one . But here , they would have to take into consideration of the talent of the individual , school fees and the teacher who taught them .. <p> Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the ease of creating magic equipment , they were still expensive .

The people behind him are even more troublesome ! ! ! <p> She really did not want to come into this world just to get caught up with some ghastly heaven or hell fights between nobles The fantasy books out there showed that protagonists caught up in such a plot would find themselves in very uncomfortable situations . If it was not some heroic BSOD trope , it was some form of bodily torture . In any case it was all sorts of misery where it had to take twenty or thirty chapters later before there was any chance of resistance And this was the type where plot proceeded quickly ! <p> " " The merfolk was a little speechless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but why did this little miss who looked like a human appear like she did not want to lift a finger at all ? ! <p> Certainly , there was the possibility of this little girl being too young and not knowing the seriousness of this poison causing the boys death But that argument is sort of wrong , she did identify the material and speculated the boys identity as a noble with much logic <p> Then is she sensible or not sensible ? ! Or could it be .. she 's such a little crook who 's so cruel at her young age ? ! <p> The merfolk was deeply conflicted . <p> Sue glanced at the tiger who entered the safety zone with the little boy . She ignored the huge tiger head who 's fawning on her shoulder , and tried to shoo the people here away : " Alright , you should quickly leave now !

Brendel and Romaine will travel across the Zevail mountain pathway to inform Fortress Riedon of the attack . <p> They were going to move out in three hours . <p> Marden dismissed them , and the young guards quietly turned around and left . They did not waste their breaths on any more words , and only the sound of clinking equipment being packed by them . <p> The campfires wood crackled while the flames flicked chaotically , and the shadows swayed about on the ground that was full of leaves and pebbles . Everyone had many things to prepare for the attack . The final few hours of the night felt like grueling torture to them . <p> Freya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brendel packed his own bag and stashed the remaining health potion that he found . The other bottle that he took from the tomb had been given to Jonathon . <p> Brendel was actually unwilling to see someone die before his very eyes and saved the youth , with the excuse of I wanted to have Bucces citizens good will and his familys gratitude given to the militia . <p> He felt that his identity as a modern person was affecting him every waking moment . He wanted to pursue a better world as he witnessed the cruel battlefield in front of him . <p> He randomly stuffed two days worth of food into the bag , mostly dried jerky and biscuits that were made with various ingredients . The Amber Swords world had stronger production values compared to the real medieval era on Earth , thus there was abundant resources here . <p> Anyone who knew this world would understand their civilization level was relatively high , but the progression seemed to have taken on a different route compared to Earth . <p> When he checked his items again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was surprised . He discovered a hard piece of paper that was stuck under the bottle . It looked it was glued onto it but he easily took it out . <p> It was slightly bigger than a poker card , with the width about the size of a palm . There were magical sigil patterns on the back of the card , while there was a knight kneeling on the ground on the other side . The knight was wearing a full set of armor with his hands raising the sword to the air . <p> At the top left hand corner of the card , there was the number ii written in ancient language , while at the center bottom were six yellow crystals . Brendel recognized these crystals in the game as a term called Element Type . Six yellow crystals represent Earth Element and 6 . <p> Brendel was very knowledgeable about the games lore and there were very few things that he did not know , but the thing in his hand was a riddle that he knew nothing much about . He pondered for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geralds tomb , but that itself did not provide any clues to what this was . <p> He might be able to search the internet forums or the games information panel in the game , but here Brendel was limited to level 1 in all his knowledge skills , what could he search for ? <p> After considering all possibilities , he finally raised the card with his fingers , and asked the merchant girl who was concentrating on repairing the edges of her dress with a needle and thread . <p> " Little Romaine , do you know anything about this ? " <p> " D-dont call me that ! " Romaines little eyebrows went up to her hair : <p> " Huh ? What 's this , a tarot card ? " <p> " I know what a tarot card looks like . " <p> " Then I have no idea what 's that . " <p> Brendel scrutinized the card and wanted to say something more , but he suddenly squinted his eyes . He spotted Bretton and a few of the young guards pulling their horses into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He suddenly thought about the strange behavior that Bretton had when Marden and he were discussing . As suspicion grew in his heart , he kept the card away and stood up . He began to follow them . <p> " Wait here for me . " He said to Romaine . <p> " No problem . " <p> The guards might be youths with great potential , and their individual strength significantly surpassing an average person , but they were not alert of their surroundings . The entire group that walked in the forest actually did not discover the person who was tailing them at all . <p> Certainly , there was also the fact that Brendel was a veteran at moving in the shadows , from the time where he had to fight against the big guilds or to negotiate with them in the game . It was just that he did not realize that he was using these techniques subconsciously . <p> . <p> If a normal person saw how Brendel was tailing them , they would not see anything unusual about his movements , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes popped out . He immediately recognized the young man as Brendel . His captain had personally told the guards before that he was merely passable in swordsmanship and useless in all other areas . <p> The swordsmanship of a militia did not really count for anything in their eyes , and any of them could even defeat Freya or Irene . However , as members of the guards , they had their own pride and did not pick fights with a militia . <p> No matter how much Bretton hated Brendel , he would not say something like , " I 'm going to teach you a lesson ! " , because it would look like he was lowering his status as a guard . <p> Yet , at this very moment , what Zeta saw in Brendel was something completely different . He remembered the time when he was mentored by an esquire who even received a Scarlet Medal , but his techniques definitely paled in comparison to this young man . ( TL : Esquire is one rank below a knight . ) <p> Brendel was like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he avoided the ever-changing lights from the valley . It was by chance that Zeta spotted him because Brendel was in between the light and his position , otherwise he believed that he would have no chance of spotting him . <p> Was the vice-captain wrong about him ? Perhaps he was actually a scout for the guards ? Or was he really Madaras spy ? <p> Zeta suddenly felt himself tense up . What should he do ? He definitely could not make any noises , otherwise he would spoil the vice-captains plan . The camp was only thirty meters away and any commotions would draw the attention of others . <p> He took a deep breath and gestured at Ryan who was in another tree nearby , indicating him to pay attention to Brendels direction . At first Ryan was a little puzzled why Zeta kept pointing at a direction where nobody was at , and even thought he might be drunk , but soon enough he saw Brendel and his expression changed . <p> Holy shit , is this guy a chameleon ? <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask . <p> " I 'll go up first , cover me from the right . " Zeta gestured back . <p> " Are you sure ? " <p> " Yes , his skill in the sword is formidable , at least a second-class unranked swordsman . " <p> A second-class unranked swordsman was a specialized term amongst swordsmen . This rank was the equivalent of the best guards , while a first-class was of a white rank Swordsmans strength , or equivalent to a player from level 5-20 . Zeta was afraid that Brendel hid more of his capabilities , thus he treated him with utmost wariness . <p> Ryan nodded to acknowledge his plan . <p> . <p> Brendel was in complete surprise . <p> Twenty over men , ten over battle horses , classmate Bretton , are you trying to cause a mutiny ? <p> But he knew that was impossible and unnecessary for Bretton to do something like that . After following them for a while , they stopped and discussed quietly among themselves . When he wanted to approach closer , - he suddenly felt he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about halfway through this journey , the insects suddenly stopped making noises . <p> He used to pair up with a girl called Shadow with the profession of nightingale . Even though the scouting and searching was done by this profession in the game , Brendel learned enough from her and experienced many battles to adopt an instinctive sharpness , and even the slightest movement from a blade of grass was enough to put him on alert . <p> Just like how he foresaw Rothkos search for him back then in Bucce . <p> Brendel immediately sensed an arm trying to wrap around his neck from behind , a technique used by scouts . Brendel took one step backwards , his hands immediately working to grab the opponents elbow and wrist . He made use of his body weight and sank to the ground , and raise his arms upwards to pull and throw this unknown person , and instantaneously sent a black figure flying to the tree . The figure knocked against the tree and emitted a muffled sound of pain . <p> The strength between the two was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attacking first . However , he saw that the figures immediate action was not to defend himself but to rush at him , and a flash in his mind quickly made him realize there was another person nearby . <p> A silver flash of light streaked across the air , and Brendels Thorn of Light was instantly unsheathed . He stepped sideways and the sword was already at the other mans neck . <p> The dim light from the reflection of his sword lit their faces . <p> Zeta and Ryan were astonished . Even though they thought that Brendel was perhaps stronger than their vice-captain , there had to be a limit to his skill . Even if Bretton was the top swordsman amongst them , it was impossible for him to fight against two guards at the same time . <p> They felt like they were somehow in a dream and just stared at Brendels sword . <p> . <p> " Listen up , everyone . Captain Marden is an old veteran from the November War . Everyone here should be familiar with this point . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his loyalty . We have an old saying , If Mother Marsha allows you to live , then you should cherish your luck. <p> We can not allow a veteran who had survived against all odds from the November War to bet his life once again . That is why I made this plan . Please allow me to lead all of you to protect Bucce . It is not because I desire to steal glory from someone else , but this is simply something that I can not run away from . " <p> " Well said , vice-captain ! " <p> " We will support you . " <p> " Captain Marden will understand . " <p> Bretton smiled . When Marden ordered him to lead the villagers to the River of Daggers , he had decided to refuse . However , he knew of the old mans temper and he would never allow him to object , therefore he decided to make a bet here . <p> He did understand that Marden was trying to protect him . The captain had said more than once that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillar to support this kingdom . But Bretton also understood that Aouine did not need any cowards . <p> Once he thought about it , he saw Brendels face in his mind . The useless bastard actually took the initiative to suggest crossing Zevails mountain pathway . He thought that Brendel was just trying to find an excuse and run away . It was definitely a possibility . <p> But right at this moment , a light noise in the quiet forest made everyone turn their heads . <p> They saw Brendel pointing his sword at Zeta and Ryans backs as they walked out from the bushes . At first everyone did not react to this scene , then their expressions changed like they saw a ghost . <p> " Zeta ? " <p> " Ryan , what happened ? " <p> " Ha ha , we made a mistake . " Zetas face was one of embarrassment . <p> As for Brendel , he looked at the vice captain with surprise on his face . He did not expect this fellow to be so bold ; he actually wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madara . What sort of spirit did he exactly have ? <p> Brendel found it a little funny but he also respected this decision . Was it merely a youths hot-blooded nature , or just his ideals ? And yet when he took a closer look at Bretton , he saw there were traces of responsibility in his eyes . <p> Bretton was glowering at Brendel , how could he not do so ? If Brendel yelled out and alerted the camp , his entire plans would have been for naught . <p> " What do you want ? " Bretton growled at him . He wanted to use a stronger tone but he was hoping that Brendel would not divulge his plan , which he was almost certain of . <p> Thanks for the chapter .

Ill be able to work on more chapters of my series during the weekend ( I hope ) . <p> Chapter 51 Wealth <p> Brendel fell down onto the ground on his butt . <p> The series of battles had caused him to go weak in his knees , and there were no real advantages to be gained from them , and these actions that he took did not match his personality at all . <p> His eyes were randomly cast upon Dunns headless body , and then he stopped moving . His eyes were glued on the ring on his middle finger . <p> This ring was a long snake biting its tail in the form of an O letter , and Brendels eyes went wide with shock . <p> " Fuck me , are you serious ? ! This bastard is a member of Origin ?

If Brendel did not know what this organization was , he might have thought he was hearing things . <p> Origin This organization is similar to the Tree Shepherd , except they are even more mysterious than the latter . Back then in the games history when Saint Orso overturned Aouine , they were already present . No one knew what their goal was , but more than half of the in-game high level missions were related to this organization <p> Brendel knew that the high level members in this organization were able to sense each through the Ouroboros ring . Once someone died , the members would immediately know and choose a new person to replace him . <p> And what awaited next was endless revenge . <p> " Damn it .

" When Ciel arrived the battle was over , but he thought his lord would have easily ended things and wanting him to gather here was nothing more than a polite instruction . <p> But Brendels anger boiled over when he heard the voice . If he was n't alert enough , Ciel would have seen a corpse or turned back into a card after he died . <p> He throw a piece of the rubble at him , and the surprised apprentice dodged to one side . <p> " Woah ! My lord , please listen to my explanation " <p> " Save it . Do n't  do that again . " Brendels feelings were soothed after he scolded Ciel . There was at least one advantage for him right now .

" The young man smiled shyly as he did not wish to say that he did not use them as they were too precious . <p> Brendel cast a disapproving look . <p> " Were going up to the rooftop , drink one potion on the way up . This mana potion is n't instant , and before the next battle begins , I want to see you revived with completely recovered stats . " <p> " What is revived with completely recovered stats. ?

" Even though Brendel was not a wizard , he was still able to teach Ciel till he was at least level 40 . But he felt a little puzzled . <p> Why is this guy and Babasha placing so much importance on these mana potions ? Even though its slightly expensive , there is no need to treat it with so much importance right ? <p> " My lords words are very right . " Ciel was completely convinced . <p> Brendel walked over to Dunn and brought the Elven sword near to his corpse . There was a glimmering light on the sword that looked like it was able to reveal the color of the blood on Dunns clothes . <p> Brendel frowned and thought back on everything , then nodded . <p> " My lord , what are you doing ?

It was going to be difficult to escape from so many people , but on the other hand Freya and Romaines situation would be much easier . Even though he wanted to let them grow on their own , he was still worried about the girls . <p> After walking for a while , he suddenly remembered something . <p> " Ah , right . Ciel , what about the things I told you to do ? " <p> " What task is that ? " <p> " A task where a highland knight requested his squire to gather some stuff so that he could pay for living expenses .

She was a founder of an artistic style and was a grandmaster . I truly did not expect this earl to be such a fan of her work . There were many treasures in his collection . " <p> " No , I have never heard of this name . I am only interested in how much it can sell for . " Brendel shook his head . Most of the gamers are more interested in grabbing gold and silver artifacts . When he thought about it they were really like barbarians . <p> " Such uncivilized behavior , my lord , uncivilized !

He had never heard of these cards in the game , and today was the first time where he thought about this in detail . <p> Yes , he s from the card . Afaik , there 's a chapter later on where Brendel captures a spirit like cardcaptor sakura . I 'm guessing that Ciel willingly became a card spirit , but I have no idea if the cards can evolve .

" <p> " He s a beast tamer ! " She said with 100% confidence . <p> " .. " <p> Are you meow , serious , meow . <p> " Cough cough cough ! " The youth boy had strained his ears and listened to her the whole time with black manga lines , was unable to keep on being silent after such a ridiculous deduction . He coughed a few times and quickly said : " Actually , you are mistaken , I 'm the wolf representative of the half-beast race . " <p> " Half-beast race ? ! " <p> Tsk ! There 's actually a hidden race here ? <p> " Yes . " The wolf boys vigilance was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very young loli who appeared in this very dangerous forest full of magical beasts .

" Sue politely place her hand across her chest and bowed slightly , then introduced herself with a smiling expression : " My name is Sue Lin , probably from the human race . " <p> " Probably ? ! " <p> Sue nodded sincerely , then raised her hands in exasperation : " Indeed , I am actually not very sure of my race , do you know were I can do a DNA test in this continent ? ! " <p> Such heartache !

In other words , her game character looks exactly like her real self . However , if it was based on the game then her race was <p> But if this body was based on her real self in real life , she was definitely human . <p> Did their half-beast race hid for too long and got this disconnected from the mainland ? ! <p> Luckily Sue did not really hope for this parallel worlds native citizen to answer such a difficult question , and she changed the topic to the real question she had : " May I ask , what were you planning to do when you brought such a large pack of wolves into the forest ? ! " <p> His actions were on the level of trespassing right ? <p> After deliberating for a while , the wolf boy chose to answer truthfully : " Three months ago , there was an incredible surge of mana that swept the continent , and brought everyone a considerable amount of panic . This distortion even affected time and space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to collapse Luckily it only lasted for a while , and did not cause any permanent damage . When the elements and mana of the various locations were stable , my race did a divination and discovered that this mana cataclysms origin was in this forest . The half-beast race sent me out to here " <p> Three months ago Time space continuum distortion ? ! <p> Sue tapped her chin , and her smiley face gradually stiffened . <p> Three months ago was the time when she logged out and suddenly found herself in this world . Could it be this Mana Cataclysm of Time Space Distortion brought her here by coincidence to this world ? ! <p> Sh*t ! Could Destiny please ask for her permission before assigning her this world teleportation invitation ! <p> " Then you were also sent out by your race to check up on the origins of this mana cataclysm ? ! " The wolf boy looked at the lolis rigid expressions , and tried to think of an explanation for her : " Do n't  worry , the elements and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disastrous event again . We are just scouts to check if anyone did anything prior to unleash this event , and prepare ourselves if there is an enemy we need to fight . " <p> To her words of declaration that she did not know what race she was , the wolf boy did not believe even one single word at all , which person in this world did not know what race they are ! <p> This little girl looks very much like a human , with no tail , no ears , no claws , no fur , no webbed hands , no scales Erm , and she 's very short .. <p> Shes definitely a dwarf right ! <p> The wolf boy had never felt prouder of his high intellect . ( TL : Shamefur dispray ! ) <p> " Beside your races divination about this mana origins thing in this forest , did they give you the details ? ! Like coordinates .. C-cough !

Sue swallowed the blood surging in her throat with difficulty : " Bro , can we discuss . " <p> " There are really no further details ..

If there are some sparkles to it . <p> TL : The other WIP image I have is PSY but I think the girls would be slightly more happy to see this instead . It looks better when I applied some shading to see how it goes , but its still very much WIP . And just in case you still ca n't figure it out , its a guy . <p> Also , new poll . So , the Wolf boys exact name is Gray . I chose Ash because its more common , Chinese word pronunciation is Hui . <p> With her current stats , she was able to leave the forest as she pleased , but the reason why she still had not leave yet was because she did not know what she can do when she leaves , at least for the time being . <p> This was a realistic world , and when one person wants to fit into this realistic world , she needed an identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , then it would certainly be fine . Even without a proper identity , she can act like a traveling bard , or settle somewhere in a distant village . <p> But she 's a child . <p> Everyone would feel curious after seeing a child and her cat living alone . <p> If it was a team of human adventurers who extended this offer to her to live in a human city , Sue might probably agree to it . <p> But a half-beast race who likes to pull each other tails , biting and clawing in some muddy ditch ? ! <p> Just thinking about it made Sue feel that life was hopeless . <p> " I think I am more suited to live amongst the humans " She hesitated for a while , but she still rejected the wolf boy . <p> While the little white tiger was interested in the half-beast race , sadly it had no voting power . In the wolf boys eyes , this little fuzzball was a pet , and certainly not an important partner of the half-beast race , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The black panther laid on the ground and stretched out with its claws , lazily giving a huge yawn , then bared its fang at Sues direction as a farewell . It laid ready in a pouncing position , and jumped up onto the trees and then disappeared into the forest . <p> What ! It even knows how to say goodbye today ? ! .. Sue was touched and happy that her classmate black panther had grown up into a civilized and polite new-age beast . <p> The wolf boy felt disappointed at Sues reply , but he did not force it and simply nodded to respect her decision . <p> Sue actually admired the wolf boy for this point . Perhaps it was because the half-beast did not understand decorum too well , and in their eyes , yes is yes , no is no , simple as that , without any fake refusals . <p> If the other party did not accept their suggestion , they would respect the decision . Unlike humans , who raised the flag of This is for your own good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them follow what they had chosen . <p> Yet its also true that the average person would probably find it difficult to communicate with the half-beast race . <p> For example if the half beast sends a gift , the human who received it will have fake politeness : " Oh , you should n't have " <p> I should not have done it ? ! . And they will take it back . <p> Or if the half beast invites you for a meal , usually you will also need to be polite and say : " Oh , how can I let you treat me ? ! Let me be the one " <p> You want to ? ! And they will put back their money purse . <p> In conclusion , one must be completely direct when dealing with the half beast , or else the person will find it hard . And the crux is the person needs to be shameless , otherwise it will be worse than hard . <p> In any case the wolf boy had been received Sues considerable care , and with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys love for taking care of the younger ones .

" <p> " Ash .. " At the same Sue received the necklace , she saw a pattern carved onto the surface , which resembled like a letter and a glyph . <p> Even though she had not seen the pattern , she actually knew what it meant . <p> What ? ! I opened a new ( smurf ) account ! <p> Could this be the legendary token of love ? ! Sue saw moments of horrific cliche television scenes immediately , and her mind was blank for a while before raising her head in embarrassment to the wolf boy and smiled a little : " Well , thanks . Before you go , inform me , I 'll pass you some medicine . " <p> The wolf boy whose name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice : " If I 'm not wrong , within another few days , the other races representatives will come to investigate the reason of the mana cataclysm .

" Sue smiled very meekly : " Its just that the current house prices out there are too expensive , and I have n't found the appropriate chance .. When the kingdom adjusts their house prices , I 'll find a suitable house and move out . " <p> " .. " <p> The wolf tooth on the wolf boys necklace , seemed to be his own tooth . Maybe the tooth fell out when his teeth started changing , or maybe it got knocked out from someones fight . Since Sue know about their lifestyle , getting a few teeth knocked out was not an impossible thing , and it might be possible that bones were broken . <p> Still , even if she did not understand the worlds customs , this thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to repay the lifes gratitude , he actually gave his body tooth away ? !

The original meaning has a longer story behind it , but just think of it as devoting everything to the person . ) <p> In the middle of the night , Sue gazed at the sharp wolf tooth and tried to think of what deeper intentions the wolf boy had , as well as thinking what medicine she should prepare for him . <p> For the past three months , she had experimented on various herbs in this world to replace the recipes in the game .

It seemed like he was commanding the pack of wolves , and then he raised his head and howled . The wolves also howled along with him . <p> He then jumped into the river and the pack of wolves followed after him . Not long later , they disappeared into the fog <p> " " ..

Without the powerful elves controlling the area , the magical beasts that was nourished by the mana concentration in the air started to grow and evolved quickly . Some of these even started to possess sentient thoughts <p> The wolf boy had always thought that these stories were merely legends , but after experiencing the beasts today , he had to admit that the sages were right . <p> If he did not bring the wolf pack out , and if he was not the top fighter in his clan .

He had spent a large amount of his energy in the battles this morning , and there was no time to bandage himself properly and rest .

What 's going to happen next is me finishing my assignments first before going back to TL . That means I 'm not going to TL TAS for a few days until maybe Thursday or Friday . <p> 11 more ch to go <p> TL : Scroll down a lot if you want to skip to the story , otherwise read on for some analysis on the in-text power rankings . <p> I recall a comment on Mahouka Rettouseis protagonist Tatsuya , describing him as a shark swimming in a very small pool , because he owned everyone in school . I find that it kind of applies to Brendel too . Most of the commoners/mercs react in a very WTF manner whenever Brendel does his stuff , but when it comes to the really strong people like Tirste , Brendel gets his ass handed to him . <p> Above that is some other term that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> here 's a power hierarchy that 's based on innate talent ( ranked by me ) . <p> CommonersSoldiers/most mercsFreya/Felix/Brendel ( without the cheat system ) Ebdon/some of the Madara undeadsTirste/People with Blessed status/Brendels grandfather probably/Players in the gameTulman ( Planeswalker candidate to surpass level 160 , but he failed ) Planeswalker who surpassed level 160 <p> So just based purely on the history and lore , Freya managed to climb to the Goddess of War level some time later at the end of Aouines demise . I 'll assume that she 's at level 60+ , maybe just slightly higher than gold rank and reached the next level . <p> Brendel/Felix has been described to be really good in the path of the sword , so if they are still alive , they will reach around Freyas level , but probably slightly lower . <p> And they have basic NPC commoner stats . <p> I think I read somewhere from Brendels description in the story , Ebdon becomes really powerful if he s not killed , and he s alive even after Freya died in the original lore , and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hierarchy . <p> Blessed Status . As you can see , Tirstes stats are off the charts . He has been described as having two times the speed of a F1 racing car ( 120 agility ) , and he has the toughness of a tank ( 60 phys ) , and stopped the Crusader Executioner with one hand . And he s just level 40+ . <p> Brendels grandfather is very likely to be powerful as heck , because Brendel had repeatedly said that he s too good to be just a veteran from the November war . <p> When I look at it from a DnD POV , the stats growth of Brendels profession is also garbage . His mercenary growth stats are better than his militia growth , certainly , but he s actually trying hard to save his XP , probably for his Knight or Paladin class which has much higher stats growth .

There 's quite a bit of fine details that I think people might miss so I 'm putting my input here . <p> /End info <p> Chapter 58 Disasters aftermath <p> " A riot ? " <p> Batum was sitting on top of a thick tree branch , which appeared to be a elm or beech tree . His legs stomped onto the base of it as he suddenly sneezed .

Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pine River , and the people here intercepted the logs and process them here .

Matteya described this period The slumber of myriad creatures . Planeswalkers could only use the Blue , Black , Gray , Green and White cards during this phase , allowing them access to defense and counterattack manuevers . <p> Brendel watched the last few birds fly into the shadowy forest as the white moon appeared above the pine forest , before everything went quite with the exception of the occasional sounds from the birds . <p> The city of Bruglas was to the north , and if one was to gaze from the edge of the forest , they would find an aurora on top of the darkened mountains . Stars lit the sky and it looked like there were precious gems decorating it . <p> Brendel was familiar with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to train with a sword here with his grandfather . The other half recalled that this place would become a bandits den seven years later , and after the Regent Princess went after the illegal merchants , the underground auctions were moved and held here . <p> Brendel felt slightly dazed as he went back and forth to the two memories , and the images felt like they were faded yellow photos . <p> Amandina stood uneasily beneath the open sky . She wore a pretty white dress . She had never been out to the outskirts of Bruglas so late , and even she was still a young noble girl , she had rarely attended slumber parties with the other girls . She had always felt she was somewhat of a loner , but she had proudly thought that it was because she was nothing like the other ignorant ladies . <p> She gazed at the silver moon . She was slightly apprehensive in the dark forest , but she was also feeling curious , and she wanted to keep on going with the people around her as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was completely new and exciting for her . <p> But she quickly stopped that and calmed down . She took over Batums words and gave her own opinion . <p> " If Tirste is n't testing us , then the Unifying Guild is planning something and needs us to draw the attention of the nobles . And I think there 's the possibility of both that . " <p> " Its just as well , my lord . We should n't have any dealings with these devils in human skin . " Batum raised his voice : " Now that the bastard in a nobles attire is n't here , he cant threaten any of us . My lord , did n't  you say oure going Randner ? All of us will follow you there ! I want to see if he can do anything to us once were gone ! " <p> Amandina listened to Batum and looked at Brendel . She finally realized that Brendel was not just a high ranking member of the mercenaries , he was the leader amongst them . This made him appear more mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart was Tirstes identity as the Unifying Guilds member . That organization name in Aouine was not just infamy , and the girl paled when she heard of that name . Even though she wondered if Brendel was lying to her , but it looked there was no need for the young knight to do so . <p> She quickly saw that Brendel was shaking his head . <p> Brendel took his mind off the Windows Stats . He was certain that Planeswalker was not a profession . He had seen no indication of the word anywhere in it , and it was not even a title or sub-profession . <p> A Planeswalkers core is still the Cards of Fate . If I 'm able to read the cards through the system , then maybe I can see this as a unique item that has its own system , and based on that a player can simulate and implement the abilities of any profession .

When he was level ten as a mercenary , he had four cards , when he rose to level thirteen , he had five cards , and the Elements related to the Knight card combination , Red , Gold and Gray , had risen by one cell in his Elemental Pool . <p> That was when he heard Batums words . <p> Batums words somehow reflect his own heart , but he knew that it was not possible for him to think this way right now . He was no longer a pure gamer . <p> Aligning with the Unifying Guild might be an advantage . Its quite obvious that I 'm not going to work with them , but I need to consider how to stab them in the back from this position <p> So he shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asked hesitatingly : " My lord , are you going to work with them ? These people are terrible , they have never had any goodwill to their name . " <p> Amandina wanted to say something but she stopped herself . Brendels decision had made her sigh with relief . She had originally wanted to warn Brendel that the Unifying Guilds influence was not small , and if Tirste allowed him to leave , he must have a backup plan . <p> She did not wish for The Amber Sword mercenaries to have a strong enemy behind their backs even before they left Grinoires . As her advisor , she was already placing them as his private property . <p> " I understand what they are , Batum . But you have to consider the aftermath for everything . If I suggested this idea to that bastard , I would n't say a lie that can be broken anytime . " Brendel said . <p> " Does n't  it mean we have to encourage the refugees to cause a riot ? " Batum scratched his head , and appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brendel will definitely have a solution . Back in Bucce , we all called him almighty Brendel !

Brendel eyed the lass with chargin . <p> The original dresses that Romaine and Amandina wore were damaged during the chaos in the auction site , and they had gone back to change before regrouping . <p> Brendel had bought a few dresses for during the escape from Bucce and she had kept them like they were treasure , but now she wore one of Amandinas formal black dress , which was exceptionally compatible for her . It was a splendid dress that flowed behind her , and underneath her skirt a white lace petticoat . <p> She walked with assured confidence and a unique air , and her full chest was matched by the tight fitting dress , and her slim waist ended with a beautiful curve , even making Amandina jealous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light brown hair with a flower ornament into a stylish hairstyle , and when Brendel saw Romaine , she proudly spun one round with a sweet smile , even throwing him a foxy wink . Even till now , Brendel would still lose himself when he looked at her . <p> She looks like a great merchant from Ampere Seale who deals with huge transactions .. Except no one would roll up her sleeves and pick up rocks to throw in the river with a serious expression to see if the rocks went further than the last . <p> Brendel did not really understand why she had to wear such a troublesome outfit into this wilderness , but he guessed that it would be something like Because I 'm a merchant ! , which was an answer that really did not go through thinking . <p> Batum looked doubtfully at Brendel after listening to Romaines answer . <p> Brendel nodded : " Even before half a month , these refugees that gathered to the south of Bruglas will cause problems . The festival right now might soothe them for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problems . This is not something that the nobles living a lavish life will understand . " <p> " Really ? " This time Amandina was curious . <p> Brendel nodded . " The Augusts Riot " , was not a big deal in history , but it was enough to give an answer to Tirste and they did not have to lift a finger . <p> Brendel did not have any thoughts about stopping the riot , especially when he did not have the means to do so . Finding a suitable place for the refugees to live in was a difficult problem , and none of the nobles wanted to receive this burden , and no one could handle it either . <p> How is one going to find food for these tens of thousands of people ? Thats finding three hundred tons of food per month . <p> Batum opened and closed his mouth . He did not expect for this complicated problem to be solved easily by Brendels lips . He looked back at Amandina who did not seemed to worry as much as him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplest profit and loss , but even she found that Brendel seemed to know something more than any of them . <p> Brendel spotted Roen walking out from the dark forest , and he became alert . He had let the cripple check something out in the city , and it seemed that he had answers ready . <p> Indeed , Roen came along with two short thieves from the bushes and came to Brendel . <p> " We discovered the cause . Its really because of the fuckwits who were negligent and allowed the undead to come in as disguised merchants . " Roen said . <p> " Who exactly was the culprit ? " Brendel asked . <p> " Its one of the cavalry leaders , called Calancadr . " Roen wanted to say something more , but he saw Brendel shaking his head . <p> That person is the future commander of the Silver-winged commander <p> " That person swears allegiance to the Royal Crown " Brendel muttered to himself . <p> Negligence I see . This matter is n't as simple as it looks . Just thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has something to do with the political strife with the Royal Crown and the other factions . Because of the riot in Bruglas , some of these historic events are not noted down , otherwise I would have known about it . <p> Brendel thought about it carefully and he suddenly broke into cold perspiration . <p> What does this mean ? Did the Royal family lure the top nobles by selling the Fire Seed , and allow the undead to come into the auction so they would kill them ? What the fuck ? Isnt this playing with fire ? I cant believe Oberg the seventh can think of this fucking plot . Its fortunate that Incirsta is n't here in Grinoires , otherwise the entire southern region would be overrun if he attacked . Damn it , perhaps this bastard is even the cause of the erosion in Southern Aouine . <p> TL : So that king meeting up with that undead ambassador is because of this ? I mean the story is insinuating a lot of things , so I ca n't be sure of whatever , but its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so what happened to his lopaz mercenaries or whatever they 're called ? Are n't  they super famous or something ? How did he manage to explain them or was it just one of those plot holes you casually wave away ? <p> Torste does n't  have any idea who are those mercs right ? And they are summoned people like ciel who can go out of thin air at any moment , they can easily poof in and out like a pokemon and torste did n't  question their existence when he entered the room , with him having suspicion of Brendel being the boss of a merc company , he probably thought of them as one of his other mercs and remember when he kills several mercs along the way before he entered the room ? He was n't bothered by the mercs lying in wait and guess he does n't  even give a thought to those subordinates of brendel <p> I meant to his companions , how does he even bother to explain how he randomly got these 12 ( 6 after half of them got raped by tirste or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean it was outright stated they 're like ciel in that they do n't  disappear so unless he made them hide themselves or something , I find it extremely odd his companions just took it in stride . <p> His companions did not see the mercenaries when they regrouped in this chapter . The next mention of them is actually chapter 75 , where Amandina meets them for the first time . I assume they were somehow dismissed . <p> I think playing with explosives would be a better description of this meeting with the undead to arrange a meeting ? Well I wonder how that character that was telling the story of events as well as the girl he was telling it to fit into all of this . <p> I suppose Princess ( the girl ) will show up at some point knowing much more about MC that he could possibly expect . As for the Royal Advisor Whatshisname ( that character ) , he was apparently travelling with the refugees incognito , and is quite probably one of the named characters in the group . <p> Level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from memory here so I might be a little off on the figures but from what I remember earlier in the story in regards to the " Blessed " and Players is that they start with stats of 5 OZ . <p> So a naked level 0 Blessed/Player has approximate stats equivalent to Brendels current level 20 stats with all his magic items . His current stats are all 6oz or below right ? <p> Its fairly unlikely any Blessed would be forced to work in the militia or any other such role and would likely start at a minimum with a job equivalent to Brendels current job but if you consider that most people do n't  have access to the magic items he does , its fairly safe to say that being Blessed adds about 20 30 levels of power to an individual . Even more if they have a really low ranked job . <p> That 's a gap that 's pretty hard to overcome and we have n't even looked at the fact that Blessed get full Elemental compatibility in every element while normal people maybe have one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A silver rank Blessed can probably own a Gold ranked commoner in a stand up fight . <p> I liked this a lot more when it was n't so overly confusing for the MC to use a card . I think it would have been a lot better if it just stuck to the MC using certain cards when he had the available resources to use them . <p> The conditions to use certain cards seem far too limited now . It would be like , you can only use Card of the Borf during a full moon on the month of Bark after eating meat and while dancing the Woof Woof. 
@@37042378 @6042378/ <h> The Amber Sword Ch 10 <p> Sophie stared at his character stats in a daze , but he still did not make a decision in the end . <p> One step at a time , since there 's no need to squander it now right ? <p> But the 10 AP ( ability points ) that he got when he raised should be used . Under the dire situation now , even the slightest improvement in power was an improvement over nothing . It appeared to Sophie that increasing the sword rank or a combat related skill was a pretty good choice . Anyone else would probably have chosen this option . Still , Sophie hesitated as he had thought of something else . <p> He dismissed the character window in his mind , and it faded from his retina . He raised his head to look at the militia , only to find them still reveling from the victory earlier . He stiffened for a moment , then his face showed an austere expression . <p> This was a terrible sign . <p> He gestured to Romaine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask : " I want to ask , do you all really think you are safe now ? " <p> His voice was not loud , but everyone present had their voices silenced , and the forest became silent to the point where one can hear a pin drop . <p> Sophies authority was still present , and the young militia had not forgotten who directed them to victory . <p> Come to think of it , the earlier warning that he gave became true right ? <p> They suddenly became self aware that it was certainly not the time to celebrate . Their lives were practically controlled by Madaras undead troops , and they still had the time to make merry . They felt a surreal feeling creeping over them as they realized that fact . <p> Thus everyone stopped and cast their gazes on him . Sophie was currently very weak , but there seemed to be an air about him that would lead them to victory . <p> Everyone believed that . <p> Even Freya sighed quietly . This was supposed to be her responsibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control their emotions , and she had forgotten that she was even the leader and the responsibilities that came along with it . <p> The ponytail girl showed pangs of regret when she became aware of that . <p> " Bandage your wounds , clean up the battlegrounds , remember what you have learned in your training . Do you really need me to remind all of you ? " Sophie also sighed . These headless chickens were more of a newbie than a newbie could ever be . It was fortunate that their stats were better than a normal NPC . <p> But they could not compare to a player , certainly . A hero profile was so much better , till the point where Sophie did not want to think about it when he checked his stats every time . <p> Sophie rubbed his forehead . <p> Under his reminder , the young Bucce soldiers started to move . They stanched the bleeding from the wounded soldiers , swept up the battlefield , and took the swords and armor from the skeleton soldiers . Their chain armors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another person extinguished the campfire under Sophies instruction . Sophie wanted to knock his head against a wall when he gave the order , lighting a campfire in the enemys rear position , he really did not know what these militia were thinking . <p> Freya originally wanted to see what she could help with , after all Brendel was not familiar with them . But she soon realized that it was completely unnecessary , and no matter what he did , he had done things far better than what she had considered doing . <p> She could not help but fidget with her hair , her mind was full of questions ; They were both militia , but was there so much of a difference between Bruglas and Bucce ? <p> How could this be ? <p> Freya had always thought the people that came from the city could not be any stronger than they were , but in front of Sophie , she started to feel dejected . <p> On the other hand , Romaine did not care about it too much , and she happily went along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the future merchant girl was only interested in them . <p> Sophie eyed the cheeky kid who was called little Fenix , as he went over to the unconscious Jonathon . <p> " What about Jonathon ? " Fenix asked everyone . <p> This question made everyone look at each other . <p> For a moment , a strange silence spread everywhere . <p> Indeed , he was one of the youths in the village , and they were familiar with him and it could be said they were good friends . Jonathon was the most timid amongst them , but they did not expect he would do something like this . <p> Even though he had no choice , but this action that was equivalent to a betrayal and it hurt them . It was as if their innocent friendship had cracked , showing how distrust between humans came about . <p> Freya also had no idea to repair the relationship between them . She wanted to protect everyone , but not only did he harmed everyone , he also hurt her deeply . Even if she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to persuade the others . <p> And if she spoke , there might not be a chance for them to remain as friends . <p> Everyone in the militia held the same viewpoint . They were just naive teenagers , and their weakness and strengths existed at the same time . As they hesitated , they cast their eyes on the only outsider here . <p> Sophie . <p> And our protagonist sighed . <p> " Miss Freya ? " He asked her . <p> " I , I do n't  know " <p> " Then bandage him . We do n't  know if we can even stop the bleeding , perhaps he will die before tomorrows sunrise . " Sophie sighed again . He was puzzled over why he was so calm , was it also not the first time he saw a dying person ? <p> Everyone exhaled with relief at the same time . It was Sophies order , and they just needed to follow it . It was an excuse to run away , but even then humans needed to escape from time to time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come over . She looked puzzledly at him but came over . <p> Captain Marden ? ! The heck , that old dude also teaches first aid here ! ? Sophie nearly choked . <p> In the game , the first NPC that taught emergency first aid in the Grinoires region was Doctor Borg from Fortress Riedon . That NPC would give a mission to collect fifty bundles of flaxseed before teaching the skill , and it was a major pain in the neck ; to the point where many people immediately skipped the quest and went to Bruglas , where they simply needed to pay ten silver coins to the Holy Cathedral of Fire . <p> Even though the market price of 50 bundles of Flaxseed was a huge difference compared to ten silver coins , it was much more of a trouble to acquire them . <p> This was an undiscovered secret ! Sophie got all excited , but suddenly realized he could not go back to his old world . What was he thinking ? <p> His excitement quickly died down , but still asked enthusiastically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Freya took a deep breath and gritted her teeth . She eyed him angrily , did this bastard not say that she sucked at bandaging ! <p> But she was not a petty person to get her revenge back , and she thought for a while before asking : " What do you want to know " <p> " The crux and the way how to wrap the bandages . " <p> Freya did not reply immediately , but went to his side to check on the girl who fainted . Romaine had abandoned her with a face of excitement when she went to gather the loot . <p> The girl only fainted from a shock and did not seem to have sustained any other injuries . <p> Freya turned back to look at the pale youth and hesitated for a while . <p> " Let me take a look at your injury . " <p> " Thats fine , I know my injury well enough . " <p> " You " <p> " Really , what exactly did you learn ? " Sophie changed the topic . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as washing the wound . " <p> Sophies heart suddenly skipped a beat . It was something from within his soul , not a voice or words , but he clearly received a message : <p> " Freya is teaching you the skill Emergency first aid , and requires 8 AP to raise to level 0 . Do you wish to learn the skill ? " <p> He exhaled slowly . He wanted this ! And it even appeared in the same format as the game , of course he wanted to learn this ! <p> The emergency first aid had the ability to stop bleeding and prevent the infection of wounds . It was a skill that ignored the surroundings and raised the chances to succeed compared to random bandaging , and was something that Sophie urgently needed . He remembered that only the army priests from the Holy Cathedral of Fire were able to perform emergency first aid . <p> To think that Captain Marden also knew how to do this , what a discovery indeed . He accepted to learn the skill but a message immediately came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for learning emergency first aid , which profession do you wish to assign the skill to ? " <p> This was not important , but Sophie still placed the skill under the Civilian soldier profession . Because the Civilian soldier profession was not a suitable profession , it would require twice the AP to raise the level , and it was still better than the commoner profession , since it was pretty much impossible to raise the commoner level . <p> Freya taught the skill in detail to him , but she quickly realized the youth was staring at her as if he did not react to her words at all . <p> She looked at him blankly , before a fiery fury burst up from her heart . <p> This bastard , was he trying to find an excuse to take advantage of her ! <p> The young girl hands curled into fists , and became so angry that even her ponytail trembled . <p> This bastard , how could he do something like this to Romaine , that girl had her heart practically given to you ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands in front of Sophie , but there was no reaction . If she did not consider him to be an injured person , she would have sent a flying kick . But right at this moment , Sophies eyes blinked and he regained his senses . <p> He checked his skill set again , and was satisfied from learning the emergency first aid . At least he would have the confidence to navigate through the future battles . <p> It was an important requirement to have the ability to heal the team members . Sophie was someone who planned ahead , and thus abandoned the idea of learning sword skills or combat abilities . But when he came back to his senses , he saw Freyas displeased expression . <p> " What 's wrong ? " He looked on puzzledly . <p> " Were you listening ? " The girl asked through her gritted teeth . <p> " Of course , and I learned it already . " Sophie answered naturally . <p> " You- " Freya nearly fainted from the lack of breath . " I have not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She checked him out with a severe lack of trust . <p> " Yup . " <p> Freya wanted to punch him in the eye . When she wanted to argue back at him , someone shouted from the sides . <p> " Boss-neesama . We cant stop Jonathons bleeding , quickly come over and take a look . " <p> Sophie wanted to swivel her head back to look , but Sophie said : " This is a good time , how about letting me do it ? " <p> " You ? " <p> Freyas face was of great distrust . <p> " Help me over . " <p> " D , do n't  overdo things . " <p> " Then I 'll ask Miss Romaine to help me over ? " <p> " In your dreams , I 'll never let her near you ever again , you shameless lout ! " Freya snapped in refusal , but still helped Sophie up .

It raised its lance as the horse charged across the land , splitting the misty night apart and leaving dust behind it . <p> Brendels reaction was instant ; he pushed the Nightsong Tiger away and rolled to his side . Three loud crashes resounded throughout the forest as the Spectral Knight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , destroying everything in its path . <p> The enemy thrust out its lance to clear the debris on it . A path as wide as ten feet had been gouged out , and both Brendel and the Nightsong Tiger had narrowly escaped its charge . <p> Fuck , Vortex Strike ? ! Are you fucking kidding me ? You used an ultimate skill right off the bat ? ! <p> Brendel swiftly wiped the cold sweat on his forehead and got up immediately . He discovered the Spectral Knight had raised its right hand and acted on his foreboding feeling . The Vortex Strike had the same effect as the White Raven Sword Arte as an Area of Effect attack . <p> If we did n't  escape in time that would be the end of us <p> The Nightsong Tiger was overwrought with frayed nerves as well . He had heard of rumors about how terrifying the Spectral Knight could be , but when he came to face it , he discovered that it was even beyond imagination . <p> He spat onto the ground , thinking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his age . He suddenly realized he had not checked on Brendel , and immediately turned to his direction , fearing the worst , but the youth had a resolute face that did not seem to falter even after the frightening attack . <p> He took a deep breath . <p> " We cant defeat it ! " He shouted to Brendel . He was still a veteran mercenary , and he quickly gauged the difference between the enemy and their forces . <p> Brendel merely signaled him to be silent . His eyes trained onto the enemy carefully , studying the designs and patterns of the gothic armor . It was the crystallization of the old grandmasters in Vauntes history , and the armor was glimmering with faint light . Even the horse was wearing heavy metal armor and he would not be able to cut through it with a sword . The long lance that was pointing on the ground seemed to extend its length with a dazzling brightness , with the Spectral Knight gripping tightly onto it . <p> When any profession reached the Gold-rank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while the Spectral Knight had not reached that level , it was an Elite creature that rivaled a Gold-ranked fighter . <p> The Nightsong Tiger got up to his feet in a rush to try and stop Brendels next action and pull him back . In his eyes , Brendel was utterly mad as they were completely not the match of the monster , and its prowess had gone beyond a normal Gold-rank fighter . <p> Brendel ignored his shouts and notched a silver bolt onto the crossbow , took aim , and released it . <p> The Bolt of Ice flew just across the Spectral Knights head and exploded onto a tree . A silver mist of ice slightly grazed the monsters left shoulder and left a touch of frost on it . <p> Brendel blushed a little and coughed to hide his embarrassment . Due to his strained nerves , he had forgotten that he was merely proficient in the weapon in his current state , and no longer the expert warrior in the past . <p> Even so , the meager damage had actually caused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had actually raised its lance to attack and a silver line of light swept across both their heads just after Brendel attacked it . <p> When the Nightsong Tiger quickly turned his head behind , he was in time to witness the trees crowns lopped off and falling down to leave behind the tall stumps . His mouth went wide and he nearly lost his ability to breath . This level of strength had gone beyond what he knew was normal and he wondered if the trees were actually packed with explosives instead . <p> Brendel saw that the Nightsong Tiger did not notice his problem with accuracy and relaxed a little . It would be a disastrous result if the mercenary commander suddenly tried to interfere with his actions at this point . <p> Ten seconds . Using Vortex Strike two times in a row requires a great amount of Soul Fire , and he s going to be on cooldown . <p> He notched another bolt into his crossbow and extended the amount of time to aim . <p> The Nightsong Tiger had regained his senses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a statue without moving , while the Spectral Knight rode slowly towards the youth . It was akin to suicide in his eyes . <p> The second Bolt of Ice was released after three seconds and exploded around the Spectral Knights waist , causing the mist of ice to cover more than half of its body . Brendel confirmed the damage with the Window Stats in his eyes , and dealt 13 points of damage , as well as slowing the attack speed and recovery by 12.5% . <p> The effects have not changed as compared to the game . <p> Brendel sighed with relief as he noted the changes , while his hands did not stop reloading the bolts . Normal physical attacks were considerably weakened against Spectral Creatures , but weapons imbued with magic bypassed such defenses . If the twin Elementalists had higher levels , the effects could go up to 50% with a single strike . <p> 4 more bolts left . <p> " Theres actually an effect ? " The Nightsong Tigers experience also allowed him to perceive the difference as the Spectral Knight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brendel heard his mutterings and snapped at him . He was annoyed at the mercenary for causing him to have a harder time . <p> " But my lord ! We are still not his match even if you slow him down " <p> " And ? " Brendel started to move back as the Spectral Knight rode towards him . <p> " We should leave this place . Compared to this monster , I would rather fight with the Black Disciples ! " <p> Brendel could not be bothered with his yells and threw a bundle of magic bolts at him . The Nightsong commander received it with a questioning look : " What are these for ? " <p> " Are you here to help me or drag me down ? " The Nightsong Tigers face turned slightly red , but he kept grumbling in his heart about his lord being an hopeless idiot or a fearless fool . However , he was a renowned mercenary and would rather obey than to disregard his orders . <p> Brendel shot out his third bolt and missed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned his armor to be covered with a thick layer of ice , and was even more effective the previous bolt , causing it to now move slower by thirty percent . The Nightsong Tiger was secretly delighted to see that the enemy to be affected , but Brendel quickly called for him to retreat to the location of their planned ambush . <p> The Nightsong Tigers eyes nearly popped out when he saw that the Spectral Knight suddenly began to accelerate in spite of its rigid movements . It was almost comical to look at , but he felt like his blood was turning to ice because he was convinced that it was going to do the very first strike that it did again . <p> However , it was merely a Charge skill and not a combined Vortex Strike with a Charge skill . <p> Brendel also used his Charge skill . <p> The human and the undead streaked across the forest . It was a surreal sight where two lines were drawn across a canvas filled with trees , continuously extending themselves while time seemed to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick twists and turns , while the Spectral Knight was forced to follow him in an awkward manner because of its mount . <p> When Brendel finally stopped , the Nightsong Tiger who had ran in a straight line nearly found himself at a loss for words . <p> " My lord , that 's " The Nightsong Tiger shouted to Brendel who was considerably close to him . <p> " The Charge skill . Its a technique that all knights should learn . " Brendel glanced at him : " As a Mercenary of Lopes , surely you would know this at least . " <p> " No , my lord , I want to ask how did you know that it would use a Charge skill at that moment . " <p> " Oh ? When I was at the Orrgesh region , my primary job was to fight against Spectral Knights . Did I not mention this before ? " Brendel quipped . <p> The truth was Brendel was also quite afraid as he felt his heart beating loudly all the way to his throat . The Spectral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first attack and they were nearly a hundred meters apart from each other , but it had been reduced to no more than fifty meters . <p> The error of margin is no more than a meter Brendel peeped behind him . Beneath the Spectral Knights mask laid two white flames for its eyes and it looked directly at him , seemingly puzzled as to who the intruder was . <p> Brendel shuddered slightly . He found that he was relying purely on instinct rather than experience because the enemy was much faster than he expected . <p> ================ Amandinas POV ============= <p> Amandina gasped softly when she saw the two lines charging across the forest . The mercenaries behind her were completely silent and taken in by the sight where Brendel seemed to always stay one step ahead at turning at the best possible moment , as if he had eyes behind his back who constantly kept watch of the Spectral Knight . The chase only lasted for a few seconds , but they recognized the significant amount of danger that Brendel was in . <p> Romaine bit her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " If every Highland Knight youth in Karsuk is capable of such feats , then Aouine would be one of the strongest kingdom ! " Amandina drew in a deep breath : " My lord You 're a liar " <p> ================= Brendels POV ================== <p> But Brendel was not in an optimistic position like she thought . The Spectral Knights Soul Fire was being replenished again , and the Vortex Strike was not only the trump card that it had . He quickly signaled to the Nightsong Tiger and they made their way to the mountains valley , where they would gain a greater advantage because the sharp rocks affected the Spectral Knights horse . <p> " Nightsong Tiger . " <p> " Yes , my lord . " <p> " Prepare to use the Bolts of Wind . " <p> " What ? " <p> Brendel pointed to the Spectral Knights horse , and the Nightsong Tiger quickly understood after a short pause . Even though the latter kept rejecting the idea to fight with the monster , he found himself ready to engage it .

Their typical actions are subtle and intentionally so . Even if they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a venue . Collaboration with Madara ? That 's even more ridiculous . The Unifying Guild believes in Chaos and follows the Twilight Dragon , how can they work together with Madara believes in the Laws of Darkness ? <p> He shook his held to clear his messy thoughts . He pointed at different directions and instructed : " The six of you , move separately . " <p> The most important thing right now was to save his own life . <p> Ah . But maybe what I told them to do was unnecessary . Should I call them back ? No , its better to be prepared , especially since it does n't  make a difference if they are here or not . <p> Brendel would have normally been delighted to order these Iron-ranked mercenaries to and fro , but right now in this cold and harsh reality , there was a Gold-Ranked swordsman who was trying to pick a bone with him , and it made him unsettled . <p> For a person to unlock the Third-tier strength , his Overall Power Rating had to be over one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blade , so he is probably training in the Elven swordsmanship which focuses on agility . If that 's the case he might have over 120 OZ in agility and his reactions must be faster than a normal person by twenty over times . That kind of speed burst is two times faster than a racing car . To handle that , his physique is also strong enough to handle the pressure from the air resistance . 60 OZ in physique . That defense is the rough equivalent of a tank . If I use the wind bullet against it A dent ? <p> A swordsman who had unlocked the Third-tier , could be described as a monster in human form . Brendel thought of what was going to happen if he received a blow from him . <p> Booooom , fly into the walls , passing through several of them before finally stopping ? That person could run around the entire place under one minute and search for me . Even if I send the twelve men out to delay him , that 's only a few seconds worth . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he could have killed me many times over . <p> Brendel sighed . He thought he had basically controlled the situations under his plans . He was always very careful to avoid the existences of these people . In his adventures , the only mistake that he had was offending the Unifying Guild , but he was certain to avoid their eyes . <p> The only thing that he did not realize , was that this current situation was nothing more than a coincidence . Brendel got up and pulled out the soldiers sword , then looked back at the door . The remaining Lopes Mercenaries had secured the passageway , while the corridor was silent and empty . But this silence made one uneasy . <p> Brendel displayed the Holy Sword card . White wings extended behind him , and a gigantic sword appeared behind him with the sigils of golf flowers . This was the third time he brought out this card . The power of the sword entered his body , and he like he could destroy the walls with a single finger . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only became as strong as mid-tier Silver-ranked fighter . <p> Sure , it allows me to hurt the opponent , but the agility difference between us will result in me getting pierced through my thraot . But this still gives me a chance . <p> There were several screams that came from the corridor , and the Merceranies of Lopes card immediately darkened by half . <p> Brendels heart gripped tightly . He raised his head and happened to see the young silver-haired noble slowly walking out from the corner . He wore a short black colored cloak and held a rapier in his hand , and there were droplets of blood on his blade . <p> Crystal Scorpion Sting . Its not even close to the most damaging weapon for its level at 60 , but the toughness of the sword is amazing . When I was still a noob , I heard a veteran saying users of this weapon had extreme confidence in his skills . <p> Brendel did not know if that statement was true , but at least from the appearance of this man , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time he looked at Tirste , the noble was looking back at him with amethyst colored eyes . When he saw the remnants of the Holy Sword on his back , it narrowed slightly , before looking at the rest of the men behind him . <p> It looks like he has some skills , but that 's nothing really much for me to take note of . Even if I do n't  show my fangs at him , I 'm still able to pressure him . If that 's the case <p> Tirste flicked his sword and returned it to his sheath , and the corners of his lips lifted . His smile was as sweet as a girls serene smile . <p> The attractive youths eyebrow lifted slightly : " Have I seen you before somewhere ? " <p> Brendel did not know what he was planning , and could only force himself to be calm . He gave a derisive smile , showing part of his teeth , before saying : " Indeed . I believe that you stabbed me with a sword about a minute ago . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , Ser . " <p> He spat the words out . As he did so , he was quietly opening his Window Stats , and the lines appeared before him like a waterfall . <p> 4730 XP . The Elemental Scroll saved me nearly 2000 XP , and most importantly it saved me the time from completing the mission . Even a few days are too wasteful . <p> Tirste shook his head , not angry at all : " No . We met much earlier . I am certain that I have seen you inside the Cavalry Headquarters . " <p> " Cavalry Headquarters ? " <p> " Correct . " <p> " Who are you ? " Brendel suddenly realized something , but he was much more relaxed after he thought about it , and he spoke calmly . <p> " My name is Tirste . I chose this name for myself , taken from the Kirrlutz ancient word Tiryhd which means struggle . If you are asking about my identity , then I am the Master Sergeant of the White-Mane army , and the right hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marnowell . But compared to these boring titles , I still like my name . It is simple , meaningful and full sacrifice . " <p> This is the first time I have seen someone bragging his own name with a smile like that . Brendel thought to himself . <p> So its him . Does that mean that he had already found the truth to Amandinas situation ? Its unlikely , unless that cripple betrayed me Does the cripple have that kind of courage ? <p> Viscount Tirste . He did not make too much of a splash in the Aouines history . The only impression I have of him is how he fell in love with a bard which ended sadly . But I do know of his personality . He might appear frivolous , but this person is careful to the point of being inflexible . <p> Brendel suspected that he had something to do with the Unifying Guild since he was the right hand of the Silver-winged commander , Megeska . Looking at how mysterious his actions were , he was most likely related to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not match the lore within the game , where he was described as bullied since he was young and had a twisted personality because of that . The Tirste in front of him was completely unperturbed without appearing to be a hypocrite . <p> Tirstes smile was like a beautiful snake . Even though Brendel knows there was danger coming from him , but he could not help but appreciate that elegance . <p> Tirstes hand was still on his sword , as though he was trying to say there is still unfinished business , and I do n't  deny the fact that I might run you through , but other than that , we can chat freely. It was as thought he had put aside life and death , and held on to his own principles . <p> Brendel was unable to find any weakness from his appearance . But the other soul in him had a fiery resistance to the powerful , otherwise he would not have fought against Madara for ten years . A cold smile illuminated his face , showing that he was calm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tirste . " <p> Tirstes eyes contracted slightly . <p> This man is n't simple . I made a sneak attack on him and he actually managed to escape my attack as a low tier Iron-ranked fighter . This means that he has some measure of skill . And now <p> It was a simple rebuttal , but it was a riposte and it was a trap to get more information out of him . The noble with silver hair felt a little awkward , and he rubbed his nose a little . He did not want to be led by his nose , but his pride did not allow him to pretend that he did not hear Brendels words . <p> " Well spoken . But not everyone in this world has a choice . " Tirste said . <p> Brendels eyes narrowed a little . Tirste was offered a carrot before using a stick , and it appeared the situation was not as good as he imagined . But handing over Amandina was not a possible choice . He worked his mind furiously as he quietly put all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For the first time , his strength broke past the limits of 10 OZ . Even though it was still beneath Tirste eyes , he had risen to a mid-tier Iron rank fighter . <p> " What are you trying to say ? " Brendels hand suppressed the Holy Swords strnegth , and his hands were sweaty . <p> Tirste seemed to have seen through Brendels actions , but he did not act upon it . However , this behavior actually made Brendel feel like he was facing a great enemy , and as a veteran warrior , Brendel was trying to find every possibility where Tirste was going to attack , and a bead of cold perspiration streaked past his forehead . <p> This damned Tirste Even though he looks like he does n't  care , but he s watching me closely . <p> " Let 's be straightforward . What is your relationship to Leto ? " <p> Brendels face color nearly turned when he heard Tirstes question , but the qualities that he had gotten so far from his experience were not false . Within an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What Leto . " <p> Brendel looked like he did not know anything , but his mind was crashing around like a ship at the mercy of a thunderstorm . <p> From what position is Tirste asking me from ? Regional noble ? White-mane army ? Unifying Guild ? Shit , it feels like all these possibilities are possible , but there 's no hard evidence . But the most important thing is how much they know . <p> Brendel stared at Tirstes eyes as it was his forte , and he had tricked many top players from Madara , but appeared like it was ineffective here . <p> Tirste did not find any mistakes from Brendel , but that was precisely why he became suspicious . He smiled : " Your answer does n't  mean anything , and killing you is the simplest solution to me . But your performance has me appreciate your talents . I do n't  really care what you say , because there 's no meaning Brendel , right ? I only want to ask you this , are you willing to join us ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? , but when he saw the hand on the sword wearing a black ring with the shape of a snake biting its tail , he gulped down his answer . He knew that Tirste was giving him a final warning , either join him or report to Mother Marsha . <p> But joining the Unifying Guild was a torture to Brendel . They were just second to Madara as his greatest enemy . That was not the only thing , because joining the infamous Unifying Guild meant that he had to accept their branding for his whole life . This was not a road that he was willing to walk , unless there was no road left .

The Nightsong Tiger immediately pursued them . His body seemed to meld together with the trees shadows ; he was not fast , but his movements were silent and practiced to the point of awe , as if he was a creature of the night . <p> The chains dragged across the floor and created a ringing sound . <p> The disciples have discovered the commotion over in this area , my plans must change . <p> He frowned as the girls behind him withdrew their crossbows . The other mercenaries took out their weapons in silence and stared anxiously into the forest , readying themselves for combat . <p> " My lord ? " Amandina asked . <p> Brendel shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside his prediction , and he needed to solve the situation quickly . He reached inside his pouches and took out a gleaming crystal . <p> The crystal lid up in an instant , casting soft light in the area . <p> " M-my lord ? " Amandina opened her eyes in shock . <p> " Brendel ! " Romaine was also stunned . <p> Everyones attention was taken by the sudden appearance of light , which grew increasingly bigger before it expanded in all directions , but Brendel threw it out as soon as it did so . <p> The lit crystal flew in an arc that passed through trees before it ended in thick foilage . Despite the layers of leaves , the amount of light emitted from the crystal still managed to light up the surrounding area . <p> Three human figures who wore black hooded robes stood there . Even though their faces could not be seen , they appeared to be startled as they stood motionlessly for a few moments . However what took Amandinas breath away were three demons half the size of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoofs for their feet , grey-greenish skin with black spiraling patterns , long goat horns and sharp teeth . <p> Chains were wrapped around their feet and ended with the disciples wrists . These were indeed the lowest ranking familiar from the Jurgen Underworld . <p> " The higher ranking familiars are on the opposite area ! " The mercenaries immediately yelled out . These legendary mercenaries had fought against great malevolent forces , and certainly knew what these creatures were . <p> But Brendel already knew where they were . <p> Once he saw the three figures , he had turned to the other direction and raised his hand . The silver ring on his thumb shone brightly as he recited the word to activate it . <p> " Oss ! " <p> The air currents seemed to be like visible lines that surged forth towards the area , before an immense blast resounded throughout the forest . The nearby pine trees were dragged along the shockwave , cause them to break and splinter , while the trees that were directly in the shockwaves path were turned into powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees were gone and became a clear path in front of Brendel . <p> The mercenaries showed signs of awe in their eyes , but Amandina screamed and covered her ears . <p> He s a wizard ! A wizard ! This knight is actually a wizard ! Her mind kept echoing this thought . <p> Romaine had seen Brendels action more than once and merely tilted her head , and just as she expected , Brendel had disappeared from his original location as his body blurred <p> Only the mercenaries saw his action clearly . Brendel had charged forward ten times his speed , casting afterimages in the opening area before he disappeared . <p> Even though both their leaders were gone , someone from the mercenaries stood out and pointed his sword at the location where the crystal fell : " I , vice-captain Rocco , am taking temporary command . My first order is to launch an attack on these disciples ! " <p> " " " I hear and obey . " " " <p> Eleven figures immediately pounced on the three surprised disciples . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lord of Thorns . The red demon was standing beside his owner , a man who wore crimson robes . <p> The Lord of Thorns appeared like a red version of the smaller demon familiars , but it had a gigantic pair of muscular wings , which resembled the descriptions of a demon within medieval folklore . On it were chains with a steel spiked ball at the end . <p> It had considerable injuries on its body . Not only was it missing an arm , one of its wings were gone . Brendel did not feel surprised as his ring were incredibly effective against monsters that were level thirty and below . It was considered the best artifact of its tier , with the only criticism that it had a long cooldown . <p> Typical demons also did not have any defensive armor , with the exception of bladed monsters . <p> Brendel observed the man in front of him with narrowed eyes while he was still in the air . <p> A high ranking member of the Disciples of Black Flames . <p> He turned once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to strike . This battle was different from Bugas duel , and he did not hold back his strength . A high ranking disciple was only level 21 , but there was a real demon beside him . <p> " White Raven , Sword Rave ! " <p> Brendels sword slashed vertically with the addition of Power Strike , and a wind blade was released from his sword . The disciple was still checking the injuries of its familiar , and completely did not expect the enemy to come so quickly . He raised his head , only to find the invisible shockwave ravaging through his whole body . <p> Brendel would have likened the disciple as a boss a month ago , but now the disciple was unable to resist Brendels full power . <p> The man screamed as blood splattered all over the place . <p> When Brendel killed a disciple in the game , the demon would regain its freedom once the summoner was dead , but the contracts dark energy between them would cause it to go insane , and Brendel wanted this situation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chains had already swept past his back . <p> " Gah " Brendel felt fiery pain on his back . <p> The demon is moving twenty percent faster from a Berserkedstatus , it seems like the disciple is dead . Damn that hurts The skin on my back is definitely torn off . <p> Brendel grabbed the spiked chains and ignored the sharp apin in his hand , allowed himself to be dragged by the demons pull and went straight to the opponent . <p> Even though the Lord of Thorns was considered to be a high ranking familiar , it was a low level demonic existence in the Jurgen Underworld without a complete soul . Furthermore , it was driven insane by the dark energy and did not possess the intelligence to handle the unexpected attack . <p> Brendel borrowed its strength and pointed his sword at the demon , directly sending it into the enemys eye . His action was as trained as ever in the game . <p> The Thorn of Lord bellowed in agony as it felt the sword went through its eye , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creased his brows , landed easily on the demons shoulders and swung his sword across the gigantic creatures neck . <p> Blue colored blood spurted out like a sharp arrow , cutting the bellows to a stop and turned it into gasping noises . It struggled for a while before it finally fell over to the ground with a heavy thud . <p> Brendel finally relaxed . The disciples were known to be dirt poor , so he ignored the bodies to look at the situation with the remaining three disciples , but the mercenaries had already dispatched them like he expected . <p> This did not mean that the matter had came to a close . There were movements within the forest that he noticed , regardless of whether it came from the Grey Wolves Mercenaries camps , or the opposite direction . <p> " Damn it . " He ordered his summoned men in his heart : " Prepare to retreat , and bring along that two bastards . " <p> He turned his head to look at the red demon . It was still holding on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known for their resilience , and were ranked amongst the top three hated monsters in the game , along with the undead and plant-type monsters . <p> Suddenly Brendel realized that the creatures he had encountered were undead creatures , the Golden Demonic Tree and its creatures , and now demons . Before he had the chance to mock himself for his bad luck , green words filled his vision . <p> " The creatures contract has ended . " <p> " The creature is a weakened state " <p> " Conditions have been met . " <p> " Would you like to establish a contract ? " <p> " Yes/No . " <p> Brendel looked at the sentences for a moment before he shivered in fright and shook his head quickly . <p> Never ! <p> Brendel refused the contract and quickly escaped the area along with his mercenaries . <p> After a short time , the Nightsong Tiger threw Redi and his companion onto the ground . The white-haired youth raised his head in defiance and glared at the people around him . But when he saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little and tried to stand up . <p> However , the Nightsong Tiger suppressed him by pressing down on his shoulder and neck , causing him to kneel down . His silver eyes glared at Brendel like an untameable wolf . <p> He roared : " You fuckers , I knew that you 're colluding with the enem Khhk , cough ! " <p> Brendel did not waste time talking to him , and simply punched him in the face . He used enough strength to force Redi to cough out blood and saliva . <p> Amandina took a silent breath , while Romaine thought Brendels anger was somewhat similar to Freya at the Golden Tree Valley . The latter was also concerned with Brendels hand . He was bleeding from the injury when he fought the demon but he refused her aid . <p> The weapon from the Lord of Thorns was poisoned , but Brendel had no trouble resisting it with his high phsyique and he did not want her to have any accidents . <p> Redi turned his head back at Brendel as if to challenge him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he licked the blood from his lips . Brendel took a quick glance into the distance . The battle earlier had caused both parties to be alert , and there was chaos from the nearby forest . If he did not act swiftly , he would have been stuck between them . <p> Brendels eyes went back to Redi . Even now , they were not out of danger . It was why he felt incredibly annoyed . <p> " Unless you 're a fool , you should already know that we are not your enemies . If you do n't  want to die , please stop struggling . " Brendels voice was cold . <p> Redi gritted his teeth . He came to the conclusion that Brendel and his men were not on the same side with the Demon he just saw . But he was furious over the fact that Brendel punched him , and thought he was taking personal revenge on him and to teach him a lesson . <p> Even so , he subconsciously thought that Brendel was trying to scare him . <p> The Grey Wolves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried if were going to fight the Paper Cards . But this bastard actually dared to hold me here . <p> Redi cursed in his heart and thought Brendel was nothing more than a naive idiot who knew nothing . He looked at Brendel with scorn , only to find him looking elsewhere . <p> Brendel was looking at a girl who approached them . Her eyes were closed and the long black hair seemed to accentuate her pale face in the moonlight . Brendel found it surprising that the girl did not appear to be in any panic despite the chaos in the forest . <p> Who is this ? Brendel wondered how he should act , but the Nightsong Tiger came beside him and asked . <p> " My lord , its the Disciples of the Black Flames again . What should we do next ? " <p> " Disciples of the Black Flames ? " Redis heart jumped slightly . <p> Brendel looked to the northern hills before he answered : " We head to the east . " <p> The white-haired youth snickered . He came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had a certain level of insight . The Paper Cards had already established a foothold in the northern area , while the southern valley allowed forces to regroup much more safely . <p> An amateur pretending to know what he was doing . This is so laughable that I feel sorry for these veterans working under him . <p> Redi started to think that Brendel was a useless leader , but he was deeply impressed when the Nightsong Tiger captured him without giving him time to react . Even though he secretly mocked Brendel , he was genuinely concerned with the phrase Disciples of the Black Flames . He secretly spied on the mercenary beside him and thought he had no reason to lie . <p> He thought it was impossible to gather any information from the mercenary himself , so he decided to try and fish information from the idiot instead . <p> " Ha Cough Haha , why do n't  you say you met with the Tree Sheperd leaders , " Redi laughed in derision : " The priests in the Disciples of the Black Flames are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital would not claim they could score a victory against them . May I know Messere Brendel , which army were you in when you encountered them ? " <p> He laughed again and looked at him in condescension : " You might want to get a better script if you wish to brag . Also , if you 're heading to the east , release me . I do n't  want to die along with you . " <p> Brendel was highly amused and annoyed at the same time . <p> Not only did I see more than one of them , I even killed one . At the peak of my level , I became a Crusader Knight where only one or two people within their organization that could fight against me . <p> But Brendel did not want to waste time explaining with him . He merely showed a beaming smile with exposed teeth , although his dark expression made him appear intimidating . <p> " It seems like you do n't  understand the situation you are in . " <p> Redis voice got stuck in his throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to even speak , so he simply ignored the annoying youth in front of him and scoffed loudly . <p> Brendel did not mind that he acted as a mute , and he gave the order to his mercenaries to bring the girl to him . <p> " Who are you ? " He asked when she was near him . <p> Redi took a quick glance at her before he turned away . <p> " My name is Yula , Ser knight . " <p> " You know that I 'm not a merchant ? " Brendel was surprised . <p> " I know even more than that . Our mercenary group is in grave danger , and I know that Ser knight is capable of helping us , right ? " The girl nodded to admit that and continued to ask . <p> " Hey , Yula ? " This time Redi looked completely stunned : " But these people are " <p> " May I know who exactly are the enemies ?

I 'll try my best to make it clearer , but you might need to reread the following chapters . I do n't  play much Magic the Gathering , but I think the mechanics are similar . <p> Chapter 51 Fishing in troubled waters ( 3 ) <p> It does n't  take long to unlock my Elemental Pool . As long as I have that , I will be able to pay for the cost of the Holy Sword and self-preservation should be no problem . <p> When one unlocked his Elemental Pool with a scroll , he would absorb the abundant energy within the scroll and fill up the Pool with Elemental energy . Brendel ordered the spiders to search for the scroll , as they were made from Elemental energy and were better candidates to search for the item compared to himself . <p> He turned his back and yelled : " Ciel ! " <p> " I understand , my lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Good luck , I 'll pray that I 'll meet again soon " <p> Brendel nodded earnestly . Ciel raised a ruby into the air and countless lines formed between his thumb and index finger . The lines that were created took from Mother Marshas protective laws of magic and intertwined with each other . A wall formed with gold light and disappeared into thin air . <p> The gigantic skeleton with crimson armor swung the axe onto the invisible wall . <p> A ripple of wind current surged outwards , and the gemstone in Ciels hand cracked , but he continued to use his life to maintain the spell . <p> " Hurry , my lord ! " He yelled in a low voice . <p> Brendel rushed out to the center stage . He did not know who managed to bid for the item . Even though items in the auction could be passed over directly , the nobles tend to protect their dignity and let the organizers send the items straight to their home . <p> There 's still a chance its still here . <p> He quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to find the doors to the Boxes .

Brendels expressions changed a little and he called out the system . The Highland Squire card was in the middle of the pack and it was colored in gray when he selected it . The Wind Spider Spirits were also the same . Half of the Wind Spider Spirits were dead and the card was also half covered in gray . It looked like the card was also going to go into the graveyard . <p> He hesitated for a while but he did not call the spiders back . It was very hard for him to search for the item in this place alone . The footsteps behind him were becoming closer , and he realized that the monster was not going to give him any time <p> Suddenly , a spider popped out from one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to another area . <p> It found the scroll ?

The spider and him turned at a corner and he saw that corpses lying on the corridor . They looked like the workers in this auction site . <p> There are enemies here . Brendel became alert , and he immediately saw that they were skeletons that walked out . He exhaled in relief , and he used the Charge technique to sweep across the undead .

The youth did not have any time to relish on his kills as the crimson figure was already at the corner . <p> The Crusader Executioner had 22 OZ worth of agility and it far surpassed Brendel who had less than 10 . The swinging axe destroyed the ceiling as it reached for Brendel , and he had nowhere to escape . <p> The only option was to activate Power Break . <p> When the Thorn of Light met the axe , there was a metallic wail as the blade bent backwards in a bizarre angle . Brendel felt like the bones in his right hand shattered into pieces , and he was flung onto the wall . <p> It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he stood up in pain and continued to follow it . He had lost his sword as his hand was unable to hold on to it . <p> I cant feel my right hand .. If I do n't  get the scroll , that 's the end of me . <p> When he entered the room , he surveyed the room with a hopeful expression , but he saw a scene that he did not wish to see . <p> A Zombie Outlander which was next to a mercenarys corpse , turned its head back . It did not expect that someone was outside . It held a scythe that was still dripping blood , and it looked at Brendel with a pair of green flames inside its sockets . The youth found that it was holding on to something tightly . <p> It was a clear crystal that held burning flames within it . <p> A Fire Seed . <p> The Zombie Outlander raised its scythe , but Brendel was one step ahead of it , and he supported his right hand up with his left hand . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gritted teeth : " Oss ! " <p> The immense wind pressure that condensed in an instant seem to leave the room in a vacuum , before it exploded with a thunderous boom . The maelstrom of air went straight to the Zombie Outlander and caused deformations to the armor . It was thrown backwards to the wall and blasted it through , leaving behind a gaping hole . <p> The undead creature was not a defensive creature like the Gargoyle , and it was instantly destroyed like the swordsman in the Pine Fortress . <p> Half of the body remained behind , and Brendel went forward to grab the Fire Seed from its hand . He did not know how useful it would be , but he did not care anymore . When he turned back , the Crusader Executioner was holding on to a crushed Wind Spider Spirit that dripped green fluids onto the ground . <p> The monster laughed from within its hollow chest . It was not sentient , but this undead monster had an innate bloodlust towards living creature . <p> " Fuck off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and squeezed it <p> The crystal ball shattered , and red light poured out from it .

The monster raised the axe , but it paused and stood still in an instant , as it was paralyzed . <p> At that moment , all the Elementalists and wizards within ten miles of Bruglas , stopped what they were doing with a change in their expressions and looked towards the direction of Bruglas . <p> The red light continued to swivel and expand , pouring out from the auction side and went into Hood street , circled around the area and finally spun around the entire Bruglas city . It continued to broaden several miles before it slowly stopped and disappeared . <p> It was a short moment , but the solders in the Silver-winged Cavalry watched their shadow hounds evaporate in an instant . <p> The power of Order . <p> The living undead revered Mother Marsha like humans did . They were also creatures that were based on Order , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crusader Executioner was different . It was a Nest creature . <p> The only exception to this was a Guardian Nest , otherwise all Nests are made from the Chaos . The Shadow hounds were low ranking creatures that were unable to fend against it and quickly evaporated into thin air . <p> The Crusader Executioner was dealt an immense impact and was unable to move . The youth saw that it took 110 damage , and he sighed with relief . <p> I gambled correctly <p> No one in their right mind would use a priceless Fire Seed to do something like this , but it proved that Chaos and Order were in opposition of each other . <p> Brendel took in another deep breath and quickly searched the room for signs of the scroll . The spider must had found the Fire Seed instead of the scroll . He did not find it and he quickly left the area , as the Crusader Executioner would not stay down forever . 
@@37042400 @6042400/ <h> The Amber Sword Volume 2 chapter 133 <p> TL : I am sort of sick with coughing and a slight fever . Drawing stuff takes even more mental energy than TLing does , so here 's a chapter in advance . I have n't edited this for errors/reading accessibility because I 'm too tired. - Plenty of names dropped in this chapter . Youre warned . <p> Edit : Man the cough is so bad that sleeping for 2 days did n't  help . Pissed off at people for not airing the room when they know they are sick . <p> Chapter 133 Romaines second plan ( 1 ) <p> In the bountiful pastures of the northern highlands , the citizens who lived there circulated a famous legend , which depicted the soldiers left behind in the battlefield to be people who were watched by the God of Death . <p> Kren Norsdt had heard of this legend too . He was hired by the northern kingdoms Baltha region , and was born in a gentry family . He was considerably talented as a beast tamer , and enrolled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular platoon was part of the southern regions army , but it was defeated by Madara and their commander slain in battle . ( TL : Not sure how to use gentry in a sentence . Nobles &gt; Gentry &gt; Commoner , in terms of social ranking . ) <p> However , the squadron did not wait for a truce , and assaulted Madara harder each time the days went by . The nobles that were further away from the battles , used the ongoing negotiations at that time as an excuse not to provide any support for them . <p> The messengers that were sent out to the White-Mane Army and the other armies from Arreck did not return , and the situation grew more desperate , and the situation turned out like how the next highest ranking officer in the 34th wing predicted : <p> " The southern regions situation is becoming worse every day . We do not know where our brothers are after being separated , and the Madara army continues to attack from all directions . We are unable to contact anyone and it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to retreat . The nobles are acting on their own , and this land has completely fallen away from the kingdoms control by now . Marsha above , I pray that I will see this nightmare end while I still live " <p> But it was all pointless to Kren right now . <p> He rode on his injured flying dragon and patrolled one of the villages destroyed by the undead . He tried taking to the sky when he was discovered , but the thick arrows managed to pierce the dragons eye and brought it down shrieking in pain . When it finally crashed back down onto the ground , he found that it had succumbed to its injuries and was pinning him down . He looked at the surroundings with despondent eyes and gritted teeth . <p> He became someone who received the gaze of the God of Death . <p> He tried getting his body out from but he immediately yelled out in pain . That crash had broken numerous bones in his body and realized there was no possible way for him to drag himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his light crossbow , loaded it with a bolt and shot at one of the skeletons . <p> The bolt had been blessed with Holy Water and shone brightly as it was fired towards the skeleton , making it hurl backwards , while setting it aflame before it turned into dust . <p> More of these white lights were fired into the air , but even more undead drowned out Krens sight . The youth reminisced upon the time when he first heard of how Madara split up their armies into three different routes . Almost everyone in the army , regardless of whether they were nobles or commoners , held a light-hearted attitude towards their enemies . They believed that these barbaric Dark Lords were going to fight amongst themselves and fall apart because of their uncoordinated commanding , just like how they failed in history every single time . <p> The result was utterly beyond their expectations . The Madaras advancing army was swift and decisive , calmly taking every bit of advantage whenever a mistake was made . On the contrary , Aouines army was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at vital points because they were late to respond , and even when they went into battle , they were haggard soldiers fighting the tireless undead . <p> Aouines days of glory were long gone , and the praise from the 17th pope of the Holy Cathedral of Flames three hundred years ago describing Aouine as The Fiery Blade that represents the shining glory of the Old Eras , was nothing more than history . <p> When Kren finally exhausted his supply of Holy Bolts , he gripped the pendant containing his wifes portrait and looked up . A giant skeleton had already blocked off the sunlight from reaching him <p> The Soul Flames of its eyes jumped about . <p> " Farewell , my father , mother , and my lovely Vanessa . I wish you remember your son and husband , and the many others who fought to protect Aouine This kingdom can no longer see hope " <p> ============== Brendel POV ============= <p> At the end of the tenth month , the scent of autumn was becoming denser . Trentheims grasslands were dyed with a layer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brendel and the others rode through the rural villages path , they could feel the wars aftermath . <p> After Rauze had ripped his leather armor apart , he decided not to replace it with another , and ordered a black comfortable robe and clothing set from a tailor during their journey . He was now sitting on the horse with a contrasting pair of white gloves , and a silver-plated sword at his waist , looking like a young noble . <p> But this was not because he wanted to enjoy being one . It was simply because it was easier for him to avoid any additional troubles . After leaving Chablis , the month-long journey was quite peaceful , but it was clear that public order was poor due to the war . Most of the bandits were formed by peasants whose livelihood were destroyed . <p> Brendel had resummoned his mercenaries and formed up into a group of twenty one men strong , and they were all well-equipped . These peasant-bandits hardly had the courage to rob them . <p> Brendel glanced at the empty villages along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Rauze that an army of Madara undead was marching towards Trentheims southern area . This knowledge was no different from what he knew in the previous world . The Black Lord Incirsta would stay in Randners region for half a year after the truce , simply because he was greedy to gain more from Aouine . This kingdom at its current state was unable to fend him off anyways . <p> In accordance to Brendels knowledge of the months end , the upper echelons of Aouine were starting to act behind the shadows . <p> Obergs first son , Hammil , would receive support from Queen Annas faction . <p> Anna , sister of Duke Seifer , was a representative of the Seifer dynasty . The members who supported the Corvado royal family were against her from the start , but it was to no avail . She even committed adultery with Marquis Kluge , and they worked together to imprison the king and left behind a disastrous and splintered the court . <p> ( TL : Kluge is the guy who advised the king back then , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to invite Madaras invasion . Benninger , dude from the previous chapter , is the son of Duke Seifer , but he s on the princess side because he likes her . ) <p> In the beginning of the eleventh month , Hammil announced himself as king and attemped to seize the throne . This formally raised the curtains on the internal strife within the royal faction . Princess Gryphine with her strong personality naturally would not accept this silently , and denounced Hammil from within her territory to the nobles and knights of the whole kingdom , accusing him to be an usurper of the throne . The people who supported her were fierce opposers of the queen and backers of the Elven races . <p> In the middle of the elventh month , duke Arreck formally announced his support for the First-prince Hammil , and the various regions either took their independence or placed their support to either side . The civil war of Aouine started from that moment . From that period onwards , the civil war lasted for two years and completely shook the foundation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resurged , but it had spilled too much blood for it to regain its former past . <p> Aouines demise was hastened because of this incident . <p> No one was able to notice what Incirsta did precisely because of the civil war . However , not noticing the Madaras presence did not mean that the influence was not there . Many cities and villages were completely empty and void of life , and there was a bleak feeling when Brendel and the others passed through the place . <p> As they reached further into Trentheims region , that sight gradually changed . They finally discovered some presense of human life near the core city of Trentheim , Firburh . The lord of Trentheims region was the third son of Duke Randner , Baron Graudin . <p> Brendel was not very familiar with him , but the majority of the nobles were arrogant and selfish . A lord was even worse , because they were merciless and cruel , heaping misery upon the citizens in their territory . <p> When Brendel and the others entered Firbugh , they quickly realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again : <p> In front of them were the impoverished citizens of the city , their clothes tattered and torn , while their gaunt , pallid faces with sunken eyes showed how they had no hope for their future . The refugees were even more wretched as though the air of death was about them , reduced to nothing more than bones and their cracked lips , indicating how hungry and thirsty they were . <p> The path to the city was dirty and foul smelling , as though excrement from livestock was everywhere in the dry air . The nobles from Bruglas seemed kind compared to this place , simply because the citizens of that place were still able to survive despite their commoner status . <p> This destitute land seemed to give birth to people filled with avarice . The poorer the land , the greedier they seemed to be . Brendel understood it was not because the nobles in Grinoires were kinder , it was simply because the lands of Trentheim were not bountiful , and their lives were in near shambles . <p> Amandina widened her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " My lord , the land you are inheriting is this place ? " Her tone was filled with disappointment . <p> She thought she was leaving the highlands for a richer place in Trentheim . The area was supposed to face the sea in the east , and it should be a place of wealth because it was easier to trade . It might not compare to Ampere Seale , but at least it should be on the same standard as Bruglas . <p> She did not expect this land to be in such a terrible state . <p> Brendel glanced back at her . <p> After discovering that he intended for the veteran mercenaries to protect her and the Grey Wolves Mercenaries , she had adopted a business-like attitude ever since they left Chablis . She would ignore him every time and only spoke when she was spoken to . Even after he explained that they were similar to heroic spirits like Medissa and brought them back , she did not relent on her attitude . <p> Brendel scratched his head at this situation and grumbled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he did not use his position to remind her on their status . <p> she is less a heroine and more a well developed side character that flirts with the male lead . In order for her to become the heroine she would need to have her character develop in a different direction . so until we really see that happen she will remain a flirt and a tease . Also a bit of a deus ex machina . <p> @rocklee Well I wish I had same opinion too , so i could enjoy this chapter more . <p> @exqal yeah i hope her antics come to an end ; ; <p> @linnilalartyr I really wish that was case Freya , amandina and princess grpyhnine ( misspelled ) all are fine by me . Besides freya was one who did her best for mc , I mean she gave up on her own desire to fulfill brendel wish of joining chivalry , she sacrificed herself in war in previous timeline and she got injured many times during battle while helping brendel While our little romaine was enjoying being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be freya <p> @storeyhunter I hope that 's all If mc genuinely fell in love with her its gon na be disappointing <p> the statement strait from the translator . even in the original language still relationaly confusing . Sigh the author must have had confusing understanding of how relationships work in rl and it just got worse in story form . <p> when she picked up wine after the refugees got to safety because with Brendels predictions she was able to with her merchant knowledge predict a sharp rise in the price of wine . He used almost everything he had to develop that business deal and used the money to go to the underground auction . <p> some things ive gathered : The first story is the intro w/c introduces another character ( probably a man turned into undead by incirsta ) that they may meet along the way which may shock brendel again . Brendel and friends travelled for a month to trent ( the probable location of brendels new territory which he decided to takeover some chapters wayy back ) , where they see that the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their homeland ) . somewhere in the shadows , romaine is plotting to kill them all amandina is pissed because she thought the mercenaries that died were living people . <p> I think it starts off with exposition ( a comprehensive explanation on the situations that are going to happen ) . <p> 1 ) The situation in Trentheim is horrible . Everyone dies in despair . The survivors are basically rekted , no food , no water , no hope , no justice , while the rich/nobles are still enjoying their riches . Kren is probably the last example of how the soldiers died there . <p> 2 ) Outlines the scenario for the 11th month and the future of the game worlds history on Aouine . <p> Queen Anna who was married to the king in Aouine , is from a member of the Seifer Dynasty/kingdoms royal family . She betrays the king with Marquis Kluge . <p> The First Son of the king , prince Hammil , usurps the throne and announces himself as king . <p> Princess Gryphine ( obviously from a different mother , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throne and is not the rightful king and prepares to fight against Queen Anna . Judging from the past hints of the Madara War , Gryphine probably won the civil war with countless bloodshed . Aouine never truly recovered after that and was defeated by Madara . <p> 3 ) Lastly , Brendel had been traveling for over 1 month from Chablis to Trentheim . Ca n't really say he teleported there . He s most likely going to steal this territory from Duke Randners third son , Baron Graudin . <p> on Number 3 he might be here for something else entirely . I mean he has knowledge of were all kinds of treasure is stored so there could be some deed to territory or something that can be used as proof he is a clament of some territory . It does not have to be here he starts . It very well might be but the main character/author has done a fairly good job about not fully revealing any of his plans in advance
