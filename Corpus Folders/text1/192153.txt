It 's so tiring sometimes to think that even after everyone is already home I have to travel for another third of the day .

You must speak with other players on forums and chats and make new contacts and acquaintances as much as possible .

Let 's play ! <p> 15 Oct 2016 <p> Analyst of our CS:GO team Amiran -ami-+ Rekhviashvili has prepared a detailed analysis of HellRaisers ' group at upcoming EPICENTER : Moscow . <p> Hello , dear friends ! I 've decided to make this analysis especially for you , so read , comment and share your opinion . Remember that the infographic buttons are clickable and has very interesting information . Let 's get started ! <h> SK Gaming <p> The champions of two last majors are the main favorites of the tournament . These guys have been keeping the first place in the ranking for about half a year ( they took it after MLG Columbus Major ) , and I hardly believe they 'd want to let someone take the title of the world champions away from them . <p> SK has lost momentum recently , though , but Fer returned only a month ago ( everyone knows the story about his operation ) , and only now they 're getting into shape again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comeback . <p> During this period the guys have won the qualifiers for ECS and E-LEAGUE in North America , and also qualified for the ESL Pro League Season 4 finals . The last LAN tournament of the team was ESL One New York where SK Gaming took the third place , having lost to Virtus.pro in the semi-final . <p> In general , I do n't think SK are in their best shape now . This will be only the second LAN of Fer since he returned . Considering the fact that this tournament has all top teams in , there is a chance that someone will be able to take SK 's first place in the ranking . <p> What should we expect from a meeting with HellRaisers ? SK is an unquestioning favorite , and we have n't met them a single time before . I would personally really want out guys to go up against SK and try out themselves . <p> The best maps of SK are Overpass , Mirage , Cobblestone and Train . This is not a very good map pool for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think it will be very difficult to earn points on these maps . Nevertheless , it 's noteworthy that if it is Cache or Nuke , then our guys will make it . And , of course , the main thing is that HR have never met SK gaming before . <h> Virtus.pro <p> The legendary Polish five , or as people like to call them the Golden Five ( although there are only three of them left ) . The second team in the world ranking and the first by shape ( in my opinion ) . VP may be the most questionable and inconsistent team for bookmakers . <p> I think they are the only team able to displace SK from the first place , although the last results at LANs do not please the team 's fans .

It 's a very tough rival , but we can play with the Poles , indeed , we do quite well . <p> Considering the last games , I think that HR have chances to take the points away from the Polish grand . HellRaisers can look to the points on such maps as Cache , Cobblestone and Nuke . <h> Fnatic <p> And here they are , the legendary Fnatic team , the best in CS:GO history , but with another roster now consisting of only two players from the former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lost their slot in the major , and also invites to some other tournaments . <p> Having added the guys from GODSENT ( twist , lekro -+ wenton ) to their team , they have started to gain momentum in the world ranking .

HellRaisers in their turn can look to a success on Cobblestone , Cache , Nuke and Mirage . <p> Last time we met Fnatic at ESL Pro League , and the match ended in a draw :

I have a very positive attitude towards this , and she is doing great ! Since we were training during the whole Summer and almost did n't have a rest , we planned our vacation to the end of the Summer and chose sunny Egypt , a city of Sharm el-Sheikh .

Let me first congratulate you and your team on getting a quota for the final qualifiers for the major tournament in Atlanta . What did you feel when you outplayed the Swedes in the upper bracket final ? <p> Hello : ) Well , I personally felt relief . That tough beginning got on our nerves , and every next game turned out to be quite intensive . That 's why after such a close match with the Swedes , I just heaved a sigh of relief . <p> As for the events before the very match . The first game in your group was lost with a 14:16 score to the Finns from ENCE . What were the mistakes that led to such a result ? <p> In the game with the Finns it was a matter of pressure and partly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was our most prepared map for EPICENTER , but afterward we did n't pay enough attention to it , and , as a result , paid enough for it . <p> The following five maps ran under your orders , and you successfully got out from the group taking the first place . What did you remember most in these matches against Heroic and ENCE ? <p> I liked it that we managed to curb our nerves and did away with the strong Danish team , having made our live at the tournament considerably easier . And I 'm glad that we proved our advantage over ENCE and that the first map was just an exception . <p> You started the play-off with a meeting against Space Soldiers . As anticipated , XANTARES was the MVP on his team , though the rest of the members did n't please much with their performance . That was the first game with SS in the last 8 months . By the way , the analyst of the team mentioned that it 'd be better not to play Cobblestone with the Turks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . How confident did HellRaisers feel in that match ? <p> The Turks surprised us , and we played the maps we absolutely did n't expect to see . We thought they would n't take Cobblestone , where we had just confidently beat Heroic and ENCE , and ban Nuke . But that 's not what happened , and we actually were pretty good on the maps that we prepared . So , SS went too far with the pick . <p> Then there were five maps with GODSENT , in four of which the maximum number of rounds was played 30 . All maps were as close and intensive as possible . You had chances to win Mirage in the grand final , though the defensive side did n't run well . What were the problems on that map ? <p> Our defense on Mirage and some other maps is fragile . Unfortunately , we have n't managed to play all combinations since DeadFox joined . But we will catch up by the qualifiers . <p> That last round on Cache raised lost of questions , when JW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your plan for that round ? Can it be said that the team lacked moderationin the final rounds against the Swedes ? <p> It was very uncomfortable to play against the Swedes , who had nothing to lose . After a victory over Spsilon , the former Fnatic players just started to go one by one and kill us . It 's a pity we pulled ourselves together only at the end of the map . And the last round was something a trade on B , shifting , znajder sneaked from behind to B , lack of time to return to B , slaughter on the plant , in which JW turned out to be the luckiest one . : ) <p> Thank you for the interesting answers , Kirill . Now let 's talk about you and future . SinceWESG , your personal statistics has been growing by leaps and bounds .

Can these functions be on the coach somehow ? <p> Unfortunately , according to the new rules stated by Valve , that 's impossible . I just have to get used to this . <p> A year ago , when schnaider your stand-in , one of HR 's calling cardwasoverpass . Should we expect this map to return ? <p> It is in our map pool , we just set different priorities depending on participants of the event . <p> Do you watch the minor tournaments in other regions besides CIS ?

Only 12 of 16 teams , which participated in DAC group stage got into the play-offs . Fortunately , HellRaisers were capable to get into the top-8 and that gave our guys a wonderful bonus upper bracket . To see it in detail you can in our report . <p> However , we need to be ready to resist the strongest ! Vici and other potentially future opponents in the winners bracket - incredibly powerful collectives , which perfectly proved to be at the first stage of tournament and obviously intend to reach the highest steps of a championships pedestal .

It is , rather , difference of characters , each of them need personal approach . After all , each is known in trouble , right ? In critical situation , when time for making a decision is minimal . World-level Dota is a game , where all details are important , every said in time word or proposed ideat can play a major role . When comes an experience , all that has to happen automatically , but Dread , Gorec , Afoninje , Goddam and Artes are young , though very talented people , who will need to learn many things .

Game between these two team within the group stage was accompanied with serious technical issues and due to that the pleasure of watching the game was spoiled . Teams also have hard times playing , when they meet some problems , not depending on themselves . As a result , our guys very quickly ( just a bit more than 20 minutes ) allowed to destroy their own base , not showing any potential . Who know may be it is for the better ? <p> In that match Vici made the basis for their victory in first 15 minutes , trying to win duels 1vs1 or searching for alone lions over the map . Non-fatal advantage in 3-4 thousands in gold and experience became a key in this game . Chinese team managed to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to increase the advantage in cost of farming , they made a courageous decision to use the obtained advantage right away . Surely , they put themselves at big risk , because any lost fight might turn over teams economy , but their plan succeeded they could knock our guys out quickly . <p> Due to the fact , that the inscription " gg " we saw in the third ten minutes of game , VG did not evaluate the play of lions in full . These Chinese had no time to feel the pleasure to play against Dread&amp;Co at the later part of the game , they did not give a chance to our guys to hool up to that game . On the one hand , it proves their advantage , and on the other it may be used by our guys . Correctly done work over the mistakes , another pick or some tactical idea and game will go by a different scenario . Vici may underestimate their opponent after such an easy win in the group stage , therefore from the point of view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of Vici in this game will be experience , including bigger games and stages . Moreover , their support in Shanghai will be more than at full on their side , therefore HR will be lucky if game would be transferred into the hotel . Such scenario is possible in case if another matches of the upper bracket will take long and our guys would not get to their computers before the stadium closes . However , it is not worthy to count on that and we have to prepare for the worst . There is a very complicated goal set before our guys and the management to abstract from everything happening around and to show the best play we can . <p> The opponent will not forgive any mistake , it is huge and incredibly strong . However , there are no teams , that can not be beaten and many , including HellRaisers , proved that many times .

Indeed , he has got a lot in his 20 years and although he has become a professional eSport player in a well-known multigaming organization , he has n't  forgotten his roots . We offer you to get to know better this mysterious guy , who has suddenly appeared on the Hearthstone stage and now strikes fear in the distinguished leaders . <p> Please meet , Lostov ! <p> Alexey was born and almost the whole childhood he spent in St. Petersburg , which is the culture capital of Russia . However , the fate brought his family to the cleanest European sea , to the Barents Sea . In the town , which is close to Murmansk , the weather turned out to be really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . After a while the family returned to St. Petersburg . <p> At the elementary school he was an excellent student , but the relationship with classmates were far from being perfect : <p> I was n't the coolest boy in the class , so I never was the most popular guy among girls ; ) It happened that I preferred speaking with girls , with whom I met due to my hobbies or some friends in common . For instance , I met one awesome girl , when I was taking part in the amateur football league . And , by the way , she was an excellent football player , too+ . <p> Besides the excellent marks , Alexey started trying out a wide range of sports . At some time he was even interested in the ballroom dances : <p> I used to dance in a pair with a girl from the higher class , and I can say , that we were doing really good , since we managed to take many prize places during that time . Then I gave up dancing and joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things were going good as well . However , I did n't  manage to win any tournaments+ . <p> the chess . One would think that the kid , who was an exemplary student in the school years , may like the highly intelligent game , but Alexey was interested in something more , he wanted to achieve some heights in this direction . Despite of the good results , he had to give up , since it did n't bring the expected ones . However , Alex continued to keep the close relationship with sport . . <p> When I was a bit older , I fell in love with football . I used to play with friends and acquaintances at the courtyard ; to take part in the amateur league and to watch a lot of games on TV . In addition to this , I used to play FIFA . Well , it was a good time in general . I found many new friends due to this hobby , and that I consider as the most important thing . Then I joined the table tennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volleyball team+ . <p> With the passing of time , Alexey was growing up , and the study receded into the background . Alexey characterizes his school years only with positive words , since the things he was interested about did help him to find himself . <p> At school I never had problems with technical subjects ; I was especially good with the physics and mathematics . But , getting closer to the university , everything had been changed . I made a conclusion that if I like something and this is really interesting to me , I can spend almost all my free time doing this+ . <p> Alexey always was a quite shy person , but it would n't be a bad thing for him . Indeed , the patience , rigidity and the ability to establish a goal are his main true companions during the whole life . He s got a certain attitudes , preferences and tastes towards the life . <p> Like most people , I do like watching different movies and serials . I frequently go to the cinema either alone or with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that I prefer listening the electronic music . However , I 'm not against other genres .

According to his words , the parents still have the old records , where he was playing some games . The first game was the race called Formula 1 , then he started to play Prince of Persia . Yeah , those days the games seemed to be so hard . <p> I used to play everything from the early childhood . The first serious+ game turned out to be GTA Vice City , if I 'm not mistaken . Like most teenagers I spent many time playing CS 1.6 . A bit later a friend of mine hooked me on World of Tanks . I used to play this game for a while . And now , my game is Hearthstone .

Despite of the fact that at that moment Alexey did n't  make a claim about himself and did n't  even get a legendary rank , his attendance request was accepted . The tournament had a good prize fund , so there was something to fight for . <p> During the whole tournament , the players had to play only one class . That time I picked Robber , since it was , actually , the only deck I could play . I was " a dark house " at that tournament , but I managed to reach the Final though , where I met with Gnumme . Unfortunately , I lost the final stage without scoring a point 0:3 . But I made a decision that I understand something in this game and that I should continue trying out my own strength within more tournaments like that+ . <p> After that Fursov managed to reach many podiums of different championships . During this time he met a lot of professional players , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lostov joined this organization . <p> When I was joining Team Empire , many people already knew me , so it was n't that hard to blend into the team . I arrived in the team by the invitation of its manager . I had been trying to take part in a special tournament before that , the winner of which would get the direct invitation into the team . But my performance was rather weak , lost at the final play-off stage . Nevertheless , I became a part of Team Empire . During the time of playing for that team , I managed to win a couple of tournaments and take a few prize places . After a while I gave up taking part in tournaments and took a short break from playing Hearthstone . I did n't  want to be a dead weight in the team , so I decided to leave Team Empire+ . <p> Not so long ago Lostov joined the number of participants of the Starladder Qualifiers .

The victory over fnatic is only a dream of most of top teams of today 's CS:GO-scene . Inside HellRaisers was not felt any confidence in advantage over Swedes , all the strength during trainings were directed for preparation to one or may be two games against Cloud 9 . But , surely , the game of jw&amp;Co was learned in details and our guys showed themselves excellently in defense . <p> Everything began from the qualitative pistol round for terrorists . The win in this two-minute round allowed our guys to get ahead in score . A classic buy-round after the lost pistol one did not bring any success to fnatic , but full-eco in the third , brought fantastic fruits . There was a turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the beginning to fully take control over events on the server . Round after round fnatic started to prove their domination , increasing advantage . <p> Due to individual performance of s1mple , HellRaisers won the third round and one more round the Ukrainian-Russian team won after a successful run-up to the point B+ . For 15 rounds , played for a weaker side , our guys managed to win 4 times . Many clutch situations were given to the opponent and were lost many almost won rounds . <p> In the second half of the fight , everything went like clockwork . The pistol round , won without losses , added some confidence to our guys and after that , rounds began to come to HR asset at enviable pace . Several times fnatic managed to break the victorious march of HellRaisers , but by such deeds they could only break down their economy . Their 14th round pronax&amp;Co won , when our team won only 13 , therefore an intrigue of the match kept until the end of it . <p> Fortunately , in decisive rounds our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the started work to the end , finishing the gaming day as winners . Victory of HelRaisers over fnatic became a first serious sensation of the tournament , because a team seeded in the third basket overcame the strongest five on the planet . It was noticeable , that fnatic underestimated our team , showed their regular tactics and demonstrated nothing fresh , unlike HR . It also predetermined a duel outcome in favor of our guys and fnatic lost and that led them to play against their main opponent LDLC in the quarterfinals already . <p> The draw failed our team this time : from three theoretically possible opponents , we got the most unpleasant one Ninjas in Pyjamas . <p> After replacement in the roster of Ninjas ( Maikelele is onboard now instead of Fifflaren ) there are not many of professional teams , who knows anything about the current gaming shape , style and level of the NiP play . With a new roster Vikings were seen at not huge online-leagues , refusing to visit any major LANs . <p> Swedes have been transformed . Their match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no hard-style AWP and the main accent was made on individual qualities of main aimers , but sniper played a supporter role , Maikelele tried a role of open-fragger , which is a characteristic to many modern players with this device . He has got enough strength , unlike his predecessor , to make aggressive run-ups and to play on charisma+ . This distinguishes him from Fifflaren- , who always played most carefully , thinking not of himself , but about his team . <p> With appearing of the new star , NiP cardinally changed their philosophy of teamwork on the map . They have determined their strongest sides and paid a lot of attention to individual qualities of the players . Analyzing a play of Swedes , it is easy to note that most of the rounds won egoistically. f0rest can give three-four kills , GeTRighT can make something unbelievable , friberg , Xizt or Maikelele can be easily a man of any round . That is a power of NiP : every player can come forward ; sometimes it is hard to predict who in particular will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way described above . In despite that playoff started 10 hours after their games in the group stage , NiP managed to sleep well and come fresh to this principal confrontation . Our team could not quickly get used to the game and was punished for that at the beginning of the first map . Started for defense on dedust2 , our guys lost main line of the game and that led them to defeating 2:13 score at the end of the first half . One of the won rounds our guys won without devices at eco-round . Their pick NiP done excellently and even the won pistol round could not help HellRaisers to struggle on the first map . <p> Our guys began for terrorists on deinferno , which was chosen themselves for this fight . The beginning of the map once again was left for the Swedes , who serially shone with individual skill that allowed them to win rounds . However , the score of 5:10 at the end of the first half satisfied both teams . Pistol round of the second half was not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : GO-scene for more than 100% ( many even had to stand for watching the game ) , was inspiring NiP , who adhered to simple strategy , the sense of which is to find an open-frag+ followed by a run-up at the less defended point . Defensive redoubts were unprepared to such a style , therefore they conceded . <p> 0:2 in terms of maps and Dreamhack Winter ended for our guys at this point . B1ad3 after game noted that the team had a lack of knowing the enemy and NiP has shown their new face at the tournament . We could not form image of NiP even by results of many pre-tournament training matches . <p> Leaving DH Winter at quarterfinal stage with 5-8th place is not a worst result . Our minimal goal was reached to come out of the group . Though not many of players are satisfied with such result of Swedish travel , the performance of HellRaisers there can not be called as a fail . <p> Now our team has a long-time vacation , which will be diluted with pre-New Year online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> How is DH Winter for you ? What do you expect from our team in the future ?

The tournament turned to be unusually exiting due to the rather fun atmosphere . It seemed as though both the teams and organizers were just having a good time there . The only minus I can call was the bad weather . Especially annoying was " a nasty " wind . <p> As about our play and the results , as well as the other teams , we were not ready for the new patch , so we had to try it out during the battles . Theoretical ideas were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to demonstrate a good , aggressive play . We were doing our best , but unfortunately we had to play without ARTES . In addition to this , being in the US we did n't  have our favorite manager , whom we call " Batya " ( that 's a colloquial Russian variant of " Dad " ) . <p> Right now we are " hanging out " at the boot camp in Kiev . During almost a week we were working as hard as we could to get involved into the working rhythm and were focused only on the game . To be honest , sometimes we were arguing , but the positive atmosphere prevailed anyway . Furthermore , it is all trifles , since inside of everyone there is an anticipation of the big event , a feeling of the big work we have to get through together . <p> We are going to do as good as we will be able , to get ready for the qualifiers .

If you buy Aghanim 's Scepter , Ogre Magi gets one more abillity Unrefined Fireblast . <p> In a few matches the luck was definitely on the side of Dread , since the highest possible multicast rapidly killed heroes , not leaving any chances to enemies . <p> Its noteworthy that Dread has returned his favorite off lane position only at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no place for such well-known Andreys heroes as Clockwerk , Nature 's Prophet , Sand King , Shadow Demon , Enchantress and others . <p> At conclusion we bring to your attention the moment from one of HellRaisers ' official matches .

Last matches , excluding their recent fight against Natus Vincere , VP won . <p> History of internal oppositions of Virtus.pro and HellRaisers is quite poor , considering fever with roster at HellRaisers camp . Last time we celebrated victory against VP at Moscow tournament - Game Show League : then bo3 series ended in favor of HR . Important detail : in that tournament Virtus.pro played with stand-in and showed not their best CS . Last time online these two teams met in October . Within Fragbite Masters 3 the Polish team won 2:1 in terms of maps , losing on decache 2:16 , but winning 22:20 on deoverpass and 16:9 on deinferno . <p> Remembering that fight , the only thing that comes to mind is Ddos-attacks , which spoiled a pleasure of watching the game .

More details about this game in our report . <p> 21.01 , 21:00 CET - HellRaisers vs PENTA @bo3 <p> Right after the duel with VP , there one more tuff opponent awaits for HellRaisers and its also unpleasant one . PENTA are those Germans , which did not allow HellRaisers to qualify for Dreamhack Winter 2014 from first try and they forced our team to go to the dream-point by lower bracket . From those times , rosters of both teams were seriously changed and now two teams are in search of optimal conditions . <p> Recently in the roster of PENTA appeared 22-year old German with nickname - nex , time by time brings more and more bright impressions .

When you will be watching the fight PENTA HR , please pay a special attention to this guy ! <p> But HellRaisers also have a young blood as Flamie , from which all await at his minimum the similar level of play . The renewed roster of HellRaisers still does not know a taste of victory , therefore in case of unsuccessful match against Pollacks , the German team has to be overplayed anyhow . <p> The strongest maps of PENTA Sports are dust2 and mirage . On inferno , nuke and overpass HellRaisers consider as favorites . Actually , both teams do not play cobblestone often , but on cache teams look more than convincing . The stage of pick/ban will play a major role in this battle . In case if decache would be left for the end , as a third map , this scenario we can call more beneficial for the Germans . However , if everything would be decided on inferno or overpass , there will be less worries about HellRaisers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group for HellRaisers will be determined this evening . Two wins would guarantee participation in the next stage of the tournament , but one or two defeats will put our team into the inconvenient situation .

Have a nice reading ! <p> Hi , Emil . What are your impressions of the tournament ? <p> They are positive , as always . We played at home - we practice on these computers . Everything is cool . It was the first time of testing the teleconferrence mode of broadcasting , thanks to two big clubs in Moscow and in Kiev , for me personally it is the first time experience . The most important thing there are no cheaters here ( laughing ) . <p> How do you estimate the playing level of the opponents ? The level of opponents play is medium . We may notice only dAT team ( a.k.a . ASUS CyberZone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just do not know the half of their nicknames . But everybody tried , it is nice to see that . <p> How much helps the fact , that you played on the same computers , on which you do practice every day ? I would not say , that too much . But it helps indeed . You play like at home , got used to everything . But generally , I would not say , that it is a great advantage . <p> What about the play of your new teammate - s1mple ? He joins our team by big steps . But there are still many mistakes anyway . We know , what to work on and he knows too what to change in order to make his play better . I think everything will be alright and he will fully join our team . <p> Have you rebuilt anything due to s1mples joining ? We have changed many positions . I , personally , began to look at many different points . I went to small plants , at B , though I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed their points . The style of the game did not change at all . We have had some rounds , where we play by skill , and there are some planned moments . We often use s1mple as an open-fragger . <p> You played several times against ASUS CyberZone on deoverpass . How well the professional teams learned the map ? Teams know this map well . We also are getting used to it , though we lost many official games . Every defeat helps us to develop our play further . The most noticeable was the defeat from NaVi at Game Show League . We made some conclusions of it and it helped us in the game against dAT . Overpass a very neat map for tournaments . <p> What about the -obblestone ? I have no idea , we did not open it from the moment of release . I have not played even a matchmaking . We did not waste any time for that . We decided not to play on this map and still keep this decision until now . <p> The new deseason released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? We played this map at the very beginning . And played it only because we participated in ESEA league , and there maps are assigned by the stages , so we ought to play it . I even remember how NaVi were overplayed on deseason . Similarly to cobblestone , we do not play on it and do not practice it . Have not heard about the new " season " , I only know that it is white . I have never been there yet . <p> What do you think if Valve adds another two maps at Dreamhack Winter ? If they do that , all players will suffer hard times . Two months to learn two new maps is very complicated . I do not imagine if they need to replace two maps for two another ones . But saying fairly , I would vote for that . But I hope they will not do that ( smiling ) . <p> What are the nearest tournaments , which will be attended by your team ?

There will be six slots at qualifications : I think we will handle that . This will be the last LAN for us this year , in case something new would not be announced . <p> How will the preparation to ESWC go ? We will take some time to rest , one week will be enough , we will visit our homes on Monday . And after that , we will gather in Kiev and start to seriously practice for ESWC 2014 . It is a good tournament : 24 participants , all of them are top-teams . We will train hard , but after a small break . <p> What is the benefit of online-tournaments ? It is a great one .

Due to DDoS-attacks , we could not finish the game and to complete the king-of-the-hill challenge . It was so sad , because the fnatic considered as top-1 for now . <p> What are your goals for nearest future ? I think it is top-3 at ESWC in Paris and also to complete qualifications for Dreamhack Winter 2014 . It is very hard to play online , there many tuff teams , which play well at home .

You are so wrong ... <p> This story reminds the episode with Zinedine Zidane at the football world championship of 2006 , when in the fight against the Italy team Zidane found it impossible to endure the acts of provocation by Marco Materazzi . The famous headbutt became a reason for hundreds of thousands of jokes and memes , and the France team lost in a series of post match penalties . <p> As a captain of the France team , Zinedine did , let 's say , quite wrong .

Moreover , even without a bead you will beat opponents at the close range , though , of course , it is better to beware of assault rifles .

When it comes to important matches , decisions and communication must be fast and clear an outcome of every round depends on that . And it 's especially difficult to do so not in your native language . So it 's been decided to say goodbye to him and give a chance to another player who 's been playing on an international team for a year . We 'll play the next official matches with DeadFox . I sincerely wish Sergey a success , I hope the experience he 's gained in HellRaisers will help him become a powerful player+.

Like dAT or Titan , which play slowly and use tactics or like NiP , play of which based on individual skill and excellent teamplay ? <p> ANGE1 : Team , where I do coordinating , will not use examples from chess tactics , that is for sure . I all my teams trust players very much and often rely on their individual skill . The most difficult in this situation is to teach all to play with interaction with each other .

They are worried about the future of not only the team , but the players themselves . We 're grateful for all your feelings , support and your opinion , which you share with us . <p> For our part it would be improper to announce the changes of the roster just by posting a short article about a change of this or that player without a word about the reasons . So , I 've decided to write this blog to try to explain to our fans what events were the reasons of the changes and why the team made such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team started before the past WGL Grand Final , when we had to substitute Bullkin at TheMontiablo . By the way , then we had to listen to a lot of negative towards us because of the replacing Bullkin , but the result at the Grand Final speaks for itself . We were right to have made that change . Monti was a young player and not only by the age : he had n't attended many LAN finals , so it was rather a risky change , but it did pay off . Maksim performed well playing low-level machines and he was very motivated at the time , since he wanted to stay in the team . <p> But as years went by some motivation decay of the player started to appear , though his performance on low-level machines was still as good as before , so he perfectly suited for the 7/54 format for our team . And his game at WCA 2015 is an excellent proof of that . But after WCA our team , as well as the entire tank community , had to face global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required reswitching to absolutely another machines and learning not only new positions and tactics , but a new gameplay in the tank esports . And if the rest of the team ( expect for Natus Vincere ) of the Gold Series had enough time to prepare for the new format ( since it 'd been announced two month before the season started ) we ourselves did n't have this time . <p> Since WCA 2015 ran in the old format of 7/54 , we started to practice the new format only in the mid-season . It required so much time and efforts from each player to make up for lost time and get in good shape in the new format . It was n't enough then to play well on low-level machines , players had to learn to play both the 9 and 10 . In this case Monti 's motivation decay did have a big impact on his results . The guys tried to suggest him spending more time on learning tanks and self-improvement . But he thought he had enough training . It all led to the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new format and play at the decent level for our team . Then it was decided to change this player . <p> This decision had been made before the Grand Finale , and not after , as most people thought , having read about the change . We never look for a fall guy+ , indeed , we do n't look from this perspective while making decision about the roster . And , to speak generally about the past Grand Final , we played it well . Yes , we did n't get the first place , but it 's not someone 's fault , it 's the team 's . The decision about changing of Minti to another player was based on the necessity of improving the skill in general and motivational factor of the team to remain as one of the best teams in the world on the growing competitive market and please our fans with victories and spectacular game . <p> lolwo <p> It was far-from-simple for the team to make a decision about changing of Andrey .

It was especially hard for Neskwi , since he 'd come through a long path with Andrey they 'd been playing together since M1ND .

Andrey had been balancing between the work and team as long as possible , but he 's not a robot . He ca n't work 12 hours a day without any rest ( 8 at work + 4 hours in the game after the work ) , doing his best here and there . <p> Sooner and later tiredness would come up , regardless of the will power .

We understand your sympathy and devotion to some players of our team , but first let us prove you that we were right again and made changes only because they were really necessary . <p> Thanks to everyone , who 's found time to read this blog .

The campaign " against illiteracy " , that was carried out after the game against the Born-to-Win , helped spyleadeR and Co. with playing on the CT side and taking 12 rounds .

But later , their rounds stock ended , HR stopped to guess and began to give entry-frags . That allowed to break the course of the fight , forced " wolves " to count every coin and even to play an eco-round once . It is worth noting that the first win for our CT team celebrated with almost zero purchasing , when only in s1mples hands was an expensive device - AWP .

The destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our guys . They won pistol round for terrorists and blocked NiPs economy , gaining by winning one round after another . At the end of the first half , Swedes managed to get a good handicap , but fantastic round 1 vs 4 in performance of s1mple shocked " Ninjas " . This clutch greatly affected the outcome of the match . It gave not only an enjoyable score in the first half , but influenced emotionally on NiP , as well as on HellRaisers . <p> On this lift-up our team won a pistol round , and that allowed to level the score ; the confident play in defense plus non-standard sniper actions confused the Scandinavians . The HRs opponents managed pnly to have one attack during the whole game and it is a great merit of our guys . This fight almost at 100% guaranteed our team the withdrawal from the group , but in order to get the highest line in the grid , it was necessary to overcome the not easy Brazilians . <p> HellRaisers16:05 KaBuM @mirage <p> The first gaming day ended with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European LAN for the first time ( we do not consider old times of CS 1.6 ) did not show anything supernatural . They fought each team , but were able to get the points only from Platinium . The play of this team was still buggy , their shooting not shined and there was no authentic prepared tactics . Such trips will teach even more than months playing through the Internet . Particularly for the experience South Americans came to the capital of France . <p> Meeting HellRaisers meant nothing to them . This match at 100% closed their performance at ESWC . In some certain and hard to imagine circumstances these guys could make this fight the last for our team also . But from the very beginning HellRaisers showed , who is the master in this house . The most confident first half , played by our guys for CT side on demirage , did not make any fans of HR worrying . The Brazilians were losing the rounds at the upshots , HR played clutches as by schoolbook , that 's why KaBuM celebrated their triumph only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace the game continued till the end . The exchange of the sides did not add any chances to the most exotic team of the championship , and the big point in this match was put by our guys delicately : they won eco-round in own match-point . Thus , HellRaisers ( together with Titan ) got into the play-offs , leaving overboard Ninjas in Pyjamas and Copenhagen Wolves . Results of the first gaming day in the video below . <p> Day 2 . Play-off <p> In the last days evening we found out that sortition made our team play in quarterfinals against the most unpleasant opponents . Before visiting Paris , Fnatic won LAN-finals of FACEIT League in Milano , and a bit earlier won SLTV StarSeries in Kiev , therefore they are considered by many as a strongest team in the world at current second . Playing style of fnatic allows players to act freely and in the same time it is thought over to trifles . These seemingly contradictory characteristics form the playing style of todays fnatic . <p> In the match against HellRaisers , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already at the stage of map selecting . Fnatic decided not to refuse playing on denuke , and that allowed our guys to choose this map as an own peak . <p> The mappool of quarterfinal looked as follows : denuke , deinferno , decache . <p> For HellRaisers everything was good at the beginning . Winning the pistol round for CT , our guys confidently won five rounds in a row . Such reserve was gained due to competent actions , good teamplay and individual skill . And after that , one round was silly lost . Flusha , who received in the head on the first seconds , had to die from s1mple , but damage of single bullet was enough only to decrease the HP to three . The main Sweden clutcher competently has hidden over the shoulders of his teammates and then won the round 1 vs 1 . It is his feature . <p> At this point everything turned over . Perfectly working defense scheme of our team started to change and that encouraged " fanatics " . They showed several tactics and setups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held on the street . In the first half , our guys made lots of mistakes and gave to the opponent 7 rounds . Even the won pistol round in the second half did not softened a bitter pill . The Scandinavians played two eco-rounds , purchased all needed ammunition and fully subdued the course of the game . A training for the terrorists play was only enough for a single buy-round , which was won already at a hopeless lag . <p> On the second map , chosen by Swedes , all rounds were hard to win for terrorists side . Inferno location , where spent hours for work over own strategies would always give sense . In our case , HellRaisers had a deal against one of the strongest defenses on this map in the world . There are no weak places there as game showed . <p> From those three rounds , that were successful for our team in the first half , two the result of right decisions , lucky timings and beautiful headshots . Only once , in the third round , the setup was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point A of serious enemy forces , where it became a good target . The other 12 two-minutes rounds were Swedish and after those number at the score table the only hope remained was a comeback in the second half . <p> The situation normalized : that was due to won pistol round and some armed rounds in a row . Our guys began the game for defense with encouraging 6:0 , but later started to make more mistaked and lost all the advantage . The score still remained quite impressive , several rounds in 1 vs 1 were won by s1mple , but it was not enough . Being two rounds away from victory , the Scandinavians showed the preparation : they completed a round on B point , and that was too hard for our guys . There were needed not so much of fnatic 's efforts in order to complete what they began in the first half of the game . They won the second map together with the entire match . <p> HellRaisers at this point finished their participation in Paris . 5-8th place is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it is also not a complete failure . Anyway , HR conceded only to champions ! <p> We can make many beneficial conclusions out of ESWC 2014 , which will be useful at bigger and more important tournament , that approaches us very fast - Dreamhack Winter 2014 . Our guys for now have a little less than a month for trainings and preparations . We hope that this work will lead our team to be a world champion in the nearest future !

The tournament itself was fine , and the stream was funny , as well , but the delays made it painful for the players to stay focused . We played our match with 6 hours delay , at 4 A.M , and that was something we were not prepared for . We played with Flipsid3 , and they managed to beat us after terrible mistakes by our team . I am sure this would not have happened , if it had not been for such a late match . What could we do . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Alternate , who waited for us in the Lower Bracket , and our first map was a total blow out . We lost 2:16 , but we ended the second map in our favor . After a thriller on cache we lost and went out from the tournament . I have to say we were really unlucky in many rounds , but I guess we 've saved some luck for the USA . It was a heavy loss , but at least we could watch the tournament from the backstage , and eventually cheer for ANGE1 in the finals , when he was standing in for Flipsid3 . <p> It was a good experience , but a bad result . Luckily , this can only make us stronger , and we have to forget about this . We have to focus for our matches in the USA.

How did you get to know CS ? Do you like being on HellRaisers ? What do you study at the university ? Tie or coffee , cake or pie ? How well do you know Enlglish ? Good luck in CS and your personal life ! bondik : Hi . I got really upset when oskar left the team . I sacrificed a lot to make it in the team I put high hopes on and I saw here a huge potential .

I 've been on the team for two months so far , and out of these two months more than three weeks were a vacation , so the complete adaptation is still ahead . And I 'll say that I take it all very seriously . Mostly I speak with Ivan , Kirill and Amiran . <p> m19Nook : What 's your motto ? What advice would you give to the beginners ? Do you get tired of CS:GO ? What do you do when it happens ? bondik : Actually , I have a few mottos . I 'm a very conscientious person , so I 'm always trying to treat people as I want them to treat me . That 's why I pretty often answer the fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the second motto , it 's if at first you do n't succeed try , try and try again+ .

Advice to the beginners you ca n't get all at once , you need to achieve your goal gradually . But you have to go the right path , and everyone 's got his own path .

How to make the team 's and your own play more stable ? What 's your attitude towards esport being declared an official sport in Russia ? Good luck in the team and more victories at the championships ! bondik : Hi . You need to work with the team : grind your strategies on empty maps , trying to reproduce situations in the game against a real rival . It 's work . Another work is your individual play . It consists of many elements such as shooting , understanding , knowledge , experience and so on . You need to try to improve all this . The team 's captain must be the leader everyone would believe in . Before the pro level the team will get through a long path to make it in this " train " . As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually .

The more you do the same things , the better you perform . So , stability , in my opinion , comes with time . You ca n't have it at first , but everyone needs a will to get it . My attitude towards this is good . It means people start to consider esports more seriously , and thank God . Thanks for the wishes ! ; ) <p> D1xon : Did you regret about s1mple 's leaving from the team , when you played on Flipsid3 Tactics ? bondik : At that time neither Sasha nor any other member of the team regretted anything .

By the way , as for the hands , the mouse is asymmetrical , so it will fit only right-hander people . <p> Having turned the mouse around , you can immediately find a few things wheel alignment , weight assembly bar and big feet made of teflon . Everything is clear with the feet teflon proved itself years ago , so we should not stay long at this aspect . Three alignment wheels are designed for changing of the mouse 's geometrical pattern you can change the location of the side panels just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more comfortable . In the weight assembly bar there is also a place for five weight plates weighing 4.5 kilogram each . By adding and removing them you can not also choose the needed weight of the mouse , but , if desired , displace the center of gravity . <p> As for the mouse 's filling , it has a laser sensor with a adjustable refresh rate up to 1000 Hz . In addition to this , inside of the mouse there is a memory unit for 512 kilobytes and its own 32-bit ARM processor . The maximum resolution of the sensor is 8 200 DPI . Honestly speaking , we do not use such numbers , but such a factor of safety looks good to the eye . It is also important to mention the onboard memory , thanks to which you can keep a few profiles and switch between them when needed , and at that be independent from a certain computer . <p> The composition is finished with an original software utility , which is used to moderate all these buttons and sensors .

Nevertheless , the software utility does its work , and you wo n't see it often . <p> We did not think a lot , bringing in a verdict . The device is definitely pleasing . The mouse is made in a quality manner , and its filling does not leave place for doubts . It is a pleasure to feel the attention from the developer to the gamer 's comfortable the weight and geometry are easy to tune up , as well as to bind all buttons . The only disadvantage is the software utility , which annoys a little bit with its bright background , but this is the first and the last negative attribute of the manipulator . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment : <p> To be honest , I am not really used to such a shape of a mouse , and firstly it pushed me off , but , having used it for some time , I understood that everything is rather good .

@@36245371 @5245371/ <h> Top Five Decks in Hearthstone <p> Nikolai -NickChipper-+ Velichko has written a blog , which he 's discussed a topic of best decks in the card game by Blizzard . <p> Good whatever time of day it is , friend and fans of Hearthstone ! It is HR.NickChipper here , and today 's topic will be Top 5 decks of the current meta+ . <p> To begin with , I would like to say that a name of the topic should be corrected a little , since in Hearthstone there are always two different roads , two different metas . They are a tournament meta and ladder one . <p> Very rarely these two metas are similar , and the current one of the tournament do differ from the ladder . Starladder Season 1 ended just a week ago , and I want to congratulate participants and a winner of the tournament , StanCifka . So , what was I talking about ? Oh , yeah ! Speaking about the tournament meta , considering past SLTV Hearthstone , I want you friends to believe me that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tournaments and any weekly competitions . Why ? At this tournament there was a ban of one class . And the strongest card , considering the experience of Road to BlizzCon 2015 , turned out to be the Patron Warrior deck , which was being banned by everyone at this tournament . It , by the way , has been recently destroyed . Patron Warrior will never be the same . However , on my stream in the day of the Warsong Commander card change release , a player of the Na'Vi team , Xixo , took the top 6 legend playing changed Patron Warrior ( with adding Dr. Boom , Loatheb , Piloted Shredder ) . <p> How will it be at BlizzCon 2015 ? It is hard to predict . I expect to see such decks as Druid , Freeze Mage , and Contol Warrior . Kolento took Patron Warrior , Face Hunter , Tempo Mage and Secret Paladin at SLTV himself . Aleksandr 's plan for the tournament was to ban Warrior , that will be in decks of every player , then rush such decks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sure . The last deck was modified against Patron Warrior and designed against aggression : he had a Sludge Belcher card and two Duplicate secrets , which is a very interesting decision . After all cards of the Czech player had been opened , the players started to be afraid of this deck , and thus they had to play against Contol Warrior by StanCifka . The result of it is that a strong Hearthstone player is different from another one in that a strong player can foresee a tournament meta . <p> As for the ladder meta : it is rather boring and monotonous here , which is very sad . The most popular deck in the HS ladder is Secret Paladin . You know , friends , the HellRaisers players are often asked : Is it possible to get the legendary rank with this deck ? + . Or ask : What to get the legendary rank with ? + . Guys , use what is in the meta at the moment . <p> The top 1 ladder meta in Hearthstone at the moment is Secret Paladin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , Hunter and Tempo Mage . Why did n't I point out a type of Hunter ? Because both Midrange and Face Hunters and playable right now . My advice for not very experienced players , who want to get the legendary rank is use Face Hunter . Begin with it , and then switch to harder Hunter . <p> The fourth place of the ladder is Warrior . And again there are people who are trying to make something up with a Grim Patron card , and there are also those who do like Garrosh or Magni . They are switching to Contol Warrior . For example , a player and streamer under the SilverName nickname has been taking the first place in the European legendary rating with this deck for a week . By the way , the deck itself may be found on this link . It is very strong right now , and it will be even stronger . My forecast is that we will see many Control Warriors at BlizzCon 2015 . Confidentially speaking , ThjsNL and Neirea will use the very deck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Asian region as well . The ladder is literally full of them there . Remembering the qualifiers for BlizzCon 2015 in this region , it is possible to mark Hunter as well . <p> And the fifth place of the ladder rating is Druid . It should be said about his explosive popularity at the beginning of the season , since at that time the Cursed player made up Aggro-Druid . But the popularity of this archetype has faded away very fast . Anyway , many players think differently discussing this class . A player of the Vega team , Lucky , says that Druid is the best class for tournaments right now , and Archon.Orange does agree with him . But everyone will be surprised by the fact that C9.Kolento says that Druid is the weakest class for championships at the moment . He said it is on the same level with Shaman .. <p> As it turned out , if you want to get the legendary tank in this month , you need any aggro deck and play 2 hours per day . <p> Rating : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Face Hunter , Tempo Mage <p> 4 place Warrior <p> 5 place Druid <p> So , thank everyone , who reads us , cheers for us and subscribe to our social networks .

Eventually , we really liked the game , and Yura ( Strike ) and I began to visit the club rather often after the school . We created the first team together with Yura . We invited a couple of guys from the school , but the result was pathetic we lost the first three games with a score of 0:13 . Also there was a game with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the end ... And then we started up our first professional team called pure Energy . After that we became the top 2 team in Kiev , which was a really good achievement for us at the time . In the roster there were such players as starix , Strike , Mummy , sima and I. <p> You 've managed to play on many teams , but which one was the closest to the CIS top ? Amiran Rekhviashvili : The first one is probably defdumps , to which I invited Kirill ( ANGE1 ) and Aleksei ( xaoc ) . Then came our trips over Ukraine and CIS . After that Kirill and I were invited to eXplosive . And , probably , it was my first professional team , in which we started to allocate time for the right practice . We had a partner , which allowed us to go to all tournaments in CIS . <p> When did you realise that it was the best for you to switch to the analytic type of work ? Amiran Rekhviashvili : When my professional career was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then the most interesting started . I invited Sergey , who had already stopped playing , and Yura ( Strike ) . We started to take part in tournaments without any preparation . We just came and played . The funniest thing is that we started to win almost all top teams . As a result , we took 3-4 places at ASUS Cup three times , which was really funny . When CS:GO came out , I wanted to switch to another area , since I did n't really like the game . And one fine day I was asked to help at the tournament . That 's how I 've come back . <p> What do you aim at as an analyst ? Amiran Rekhviashvili : In the first place , I need to learn . I 've missed some time and some moments are not always clear for me , but Kirill and Sergey help me . I really want to help the guys , since they are my close friends . <p> If you had to pick five best players ever from the CIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both to CS 1.6 and CS:GO.Amiran Rekhviashvili : Actually , it is a very difficult question . I think the current generation does n't know most players , but I will try . In CS 1.6 I would mark such people as Edward , hooch , markeloff , Zero Gravity ( CEO Natus Vincere ) and , maybe , Andrey Blad3 . In CS:GO everything is clear : the best CIS players are in Natus Vincere , but I would also add as the fifth player Kirill Karasiev , since he 's the best entry-fraggerin the world at the moment . <p> What does your job at HellRaisers consist of ? Amiran Rekhviashvili : So far I 've been preparing the guys for their rivals and showing them their mistakes . I gradually make it into the tactics and we now often discuss them together . We 've already had the first experience , it was a trip to Copenhagen , where we performed rather well . I think that I partially helped the guys to get ready for the opponents and I hope that some of my tips helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have at the moment ? Amiran Rekhviashvili : There are many problems out of the game , which it 's better not to reveal . And as for the game , the guys have issues with clutch rounds , on which we are starting to work right now . <p> Let 's talk about your work at the analytic hub . What do you think , will the attitude of Valve towards the Russian-speaking covering of events change , since a few leading studios have switched to Ru Hub ? It was rather strange to ignore our talents and that they did n't take part in large offline events.Amiran Rekhviashvili : In the first place , it 's not Valve , that chooses commentators , but a studio ( e.g. ESL ) , that gets the right to cover a tournament . I think everyone has seen already that our guys can cover an event just as well as other teams of commentators , and sometimes even better . So , I think that soon we will see our guys in work . <p> Are you going to work as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . I 've already taken part in a few tournaments as an analyst , but now I need to help the guys and there 's not much time to take part in such events . <p> What 's the difference between the esports of the two thousandth and its modern state ? Amiran Rekhviashvili : The most important is the conditions at teams and tournaments . In our time we had to spend our own money to travel and , roughly speaking , played for return trip tickets . Right now every team has its own requirements , and if they are not complied , the team wo n't come to the tournament . And , I think , the biggest difference is the Internet . Now you can play any game , being at home , while back then we had to go through the whole town to make it to the club to practice 2 versus 3 . <p> And last of all , say a few words to the fans and supporters of the organization . You may tell a few words on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw in the towel after defeats , since next time everything may change . Support the guys , they see and appreciate it . 178060 @qwx378060

These guys is not an easy opponent . Recently we have heard about this roster , it had a name of Copenhagen Wolves and successfully performed in different tournaments including major ones . A while ago they have had a replacement : instead of gla1ve the colors of wolves now defends the most experienced sniper , the ex-player of Team Dignitas Henrik " FeTiSh " Kristensen . Together with him the Danish team have played for several weeks and fought in a row of official matches . <p> Strong maps of ex-Cph Wolves are : denuke , deinferno , dedust2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demirage , but still have no visible success with it . HellRaisers considered as a favorite on this map , on decache and deoverpass . By the way , Pimp&amp;Co play well on decobblestone , and this is a big plus for them . <p> Within SLTV StarSeries XII " wolves " played two matches . Overplaying PENTA on two maps , the Scandinavians conceded 2:0 to Virtus.pro and for now may dream about getting out of the group only in case of overcoming HellRaisers . The defeat for our guys can be fatal . In worst case HellRaisers can go down to the third place , which will lead us to one of the rounds of play-offs . In order to avoid play-off matches for quiting the tournament it is necessary to overplay such an opponent . <p> Team is adjusted to victory and will try to show its own game in fight for necessary result.Please , do not forget to support our guys , they appreciate it very much !

Find out the answers to these and other questions right now ! <p> A week ago we suggested you asking questions to our young Slovak player . Today Martin has prepared the answers , and we 're ready to publish them ! Enjoy reading ! <p> thomyvole : Hey Martin , who is your favourite player and team ? : ) STYKO : I do n't  have a favorite player but it used to be dennis from LGB era . The team would be LGB , as well before they disbanded ( the Katowice 2014 lineup ) . <p> Sasha : Who is your best friend on the team ? STYKO : It 's hard to tell , I get along with everyone and I spend time with them equally . I would say it is the coach because we have a lot of common talks outside of the game , but , to be honest , we all are good friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? STYKO : When I was 15/16 years old I went to a CS 1.6 LAN with my friends , we were a really young team but ended up surprising a lot of teams . We finished 4th . During the entire tournament we were sitting next to GuardiaN 's team and they spectated us a bit between the games . They saw a lot of potential and after that tournament they decided to pick me up . Unfortunately , few months after the CS 1.6 scene died , and we switched to CS:GO . Due to my health issues I had to pause my game career for a month , so they decided to play with ex-source player Sneix instead . I understood and wished them good luck . After my month break I joined another team with friends and made my way up again like I did in 1.6 . I showed myself on tournaments and we always played together in national teams . <p> F1L1N : What languages besides Slovak and English do you know ? STYKO:I know the Czech language on a really good level but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also studying German , but it is a bit hard for me because I am not using this language that much . It helped me at some LANs in Germany but other than that I am no master at this subject . I understand a bit Russian and Ukranian . Probably because we have Slavic languages . <p> ZoX:How many hours a day do you practice ? STYKO : If I have classes I practice only with my team for about 5 hours . If I have a day-off I play individually before the team practice for about 60 or 90 minutes . <p> KeyToLife : Are you trying to learn Russian ? STYKO:I do not have time for that but I try to learn the Russian alphabet to understand what guys write in team chats : P I try to understand as much as possible but speaking would be really hard for me , if not impossible . <p> turboheadcrab : Why is Oskar so Grumpy ? : DSTYKO:It is his personality . Sometimes it 's funny , but sometimes it annoys you a lot . Luckily we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to deal with this personality every day ! <p> VDikan : Tell us how you started your pro CS career . How did you study at school and are you studying something now ? STYKO : Firstly I was playing with my friends and showing good performance on LANs where good players noticed us . I always had good grades at school despite the fact I did n't study that much at home . I would play games and get better . Right now I 'm studying International Business at University in Bratislava and that is why I have such a tough schedule these days . A lot of exams coming up . <p> Heaven- : Is it difficult to combine study and CS ? What is your daily programme ? STYKO:It is one of the hardest things to do . Not only to combine these two but also combine it with free-time , girlfriend and so on My daily programme would be to wake up at 6:30 , get ready to school , be in school from 7:30 until 16:00 . Then I rush home to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until 23:00 . After that I have time to prepare to school , study a bit or spend time with my girlfriend if she is not sleeping yet . So it is really hard as you can see . <p> MEDUSA:You were featured in GuardiaN 's background video for MLG Columbus and it seemed like he 's kinda a mentor for you , so what was it like going up against NaVi on the LAN at Starladder ? Any nerves get to you or were you more prepared due to the history you guys had . Also any developments made on that all Slovakian team ? ; DSTYKO : I was not nervous to play against NaVi , I was excited to finally play against a tier 1 team on a LAN but , unfortunately , I did not perform well , so we ended up losing . There is no development right now on Slovakian teams . I still believe it is impossible to gather 5 Slovak players that can compete on the highest level and that could work in one lineup . Maybe one day . <p> samosak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from NEF to HR ? STYKO : It was around the time we had problems with the manager of Fraternitas , and he refused to pay our salary for us a few months . I was going to the university and I had to pay the bills by myself . I do not live with parents anymore , so it was really hard . Luckily HR approached oskar to play with them and then he wanted to play me to join the team , so we tried to play together a bit . I played as a standin against fnatic and they saw potential . I was glad they decided to play with me and I hope HR organization thinks I am worth it . <p> KennySlav : Favorite food ? Drink ? STYKO : Sushi / Mint tea . <p> dennisdenis:Could you make your dreamteam with active players besides your current teammates ? And with you ofc ! : ) By the way , I really like your playstyle : ) STYKO:Thanks , appreciate that ! My dreamteam would be me , Edward , dennis , GuardiaN , FalleN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old were you when you joined your first team ? STYKO : Since I was 13 I played with people I met in public . Since then I play only in teams , I would n't like to play without a team anymore . I have that competitive drive inside me . <p> Spidex : I have a couple of questions . What is in your opinion the age limit for Counter Strike ? Do you think there will be like 40 years old players in the future ? ( e.g. Jaromir Jagr type of people : D ) Oldest pro players are now around 30 , for example Taz and he 's still a beast and can win aim duels against 18 years old youngsters . How many years/hours does a player need to be able to compete on the professional level ? How long did it take you ? STYKO : The age limit is increasing really quick , I think . I think there will be a lot of 40 years old players but I do n't  know if in CS:GO . Other games that do n't requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and we can see some elders playing card games on PC for money soon : P. If you practice a wrong way you may need 10 000 hours to master the game but if you practice the right way you will need 3 000 hours to master it . It depends . Some have talent and some people do n't  . That does n't  mean people without talent will never be good . They will have to put that extra effort to get to top , though . And even more effort to stay there . It is up to you to find your perfect practice routine to keep yourself warmed up and entertained at the same time . It took me about 5 500 hours into CS:GO and I am nowhere near top so as you can see , some players struggle ( like me )

Even if an enemy has a body armor , you can easily hit him in the head and make a lethal shot , after which it is impossible to survive .

If you master this weapon , you will become a real danger for any player , since only one tidy shot can take away the life of an opponent in a round . Moreover , the pistol is well combined with the AWP , that would help you at close range . Due to its high penetration you can even wallbang a rival , and thus get an easy kill which can bring you a victory in a round . However , you should not forget about its high recoil at middle and long distances it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at close range you can feel free to spray . <p> Playing against this pistol , do n't forget that any automatic gun at close range can easily beat it . Rifles are the enemy of the Deagle at long range , since they have more opportunities to avoid its attacks . P250 , Five-Seven and Tec-9 are the pistols that can compete with the Deagle due to their relatively small recoil and high fire speed . And , of course , it is vital to avoid meetings with the Desert Eagle if you have less than 50 hp , since one shot can finish you off . <p> Emil kUcheR+ Ahundov 's comment : <p> It 's been for a while since the last update of the Deagle , and all professional players have got used to it .

It was our first official event in this lineup , also Zero met ANGE1 and kUcheR for the first time , so it was something new to him , as well as for me and styko , because , as everyone knows , I had had some break with CS:GO for about two years . <p> I had to play under pressure , because after my comeback I have found the way how to play CS:GO in a good way . So there were many eyes on me . I was stressed , but , yeah , our trip to Romania was funny , almost everyone did n't sleep more like 15 hours , so yeah , we had such a fun time . But all of us knew why we were going there , we were motivated to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PGL guy showed us a hotel , which was rather nice . We took a shower , then we were going to talk about our games , but it did not happen so , everyone fell asleep . We woke up around 12 p.m. , then we had been having some drinks in the lobby before breakfast was open and then we went to sleep again . <p> We woke up very nice , almost like every pro , around 12 a.m. , so we were dead . After everything we came to the PGL arena , which was really fine , I liked everything there , there was a nice chilling area , good food I enjoyed , it was something i had never seen before . <p> They took us to get photos , interviews , we set our computers for the upcoming day and then we were just chilling , eating and watching nice matches . In our first match day , we were playing against Lemondogs . Well , I will not lie , my stress was growing up . Our first match was shaky , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ANGE1 showed their qualities and did well in our first match . <p> Every match was very close , but we managed to win each of them . It did not matter if the score was 16:14 or 16:3 , win is win , and we felt more confident by the wins . I have to say that PixelFire guys played very well . I did n't expect from them such a high performance , but yeah , they had nothing to lose , and you can play more freely , which is sometimes good for your team . So we won our group , we were happy that we did it because , as i said , our matches were pretty close , and we got many comebacks . <p> Our first match in the playoff was against PENTA . I felt good , I slept well , so I was sure that that game would be ours . We won Mirage in the overtimes with some crucial rounds , though we lost Inferno , which i did even know was our map . I personally think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i do n't know , I did n't see the whole voting , the opponents might have banned Cache . The third map was dust2 , we were like now or never , we were always good on Dust2 , so we just played our game , and after the strong CT side , which we won with a 10:5 score , we end the match with a 16:10 score . <p> Everyone was happy , we went to eat and watched the second semifinal . I personally wanted to play against E-Frag more than against PixelFire , because I like playing against E-Frag 's style . E-Frag won PixelFire and that was it . Our last match of this nice tournament was in front of us . We knew that we would win this because E-Frag had not won us for a few months , so we were confident a lot . <p> We started on Dust2 again , we made some mistakes , but we ended the match with no drama 16:11 . The next map was Inferno . Those , who expected that we would lose this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know , we started on the T side , got like 6 rounds , which is a really good result , but then we failed the CT side so hard as no one ever would . So yeah , after the match we all knew that Inferno simply is not our best map , the best map for us , which is cobblestone , was waiting for us in the third game . We had the great CT side , won it with a 10:5 score , then we took a pistol round on the T side , and then , we should have won the match , and yes , we did win that match , we did win PGL , and now we are going to the MGL Columbus Major Qualifiers . We are going to get prepared as much as possible .

We traded a lot of rounds at the beggining of the first map ( dust2 ) but managed to pick ourselves up towards the end of the half and we had good ideas . After switching to the T side despite having good openings we did not manage to close rounds in our favour and lost . On overpass the opponent did a good research against us and outplayed us in most aspects . Mostly tactically . We did not feel confident on the second map and our deseperate mistakes were the proof of it . Sadly , we lost but we can only improve by learning from those mistakes. +

This statistics can be smoothed out a bit by the fast that the oldest match of this list took place on 1 August of 2015 . The freshest ones are the meetings at the qualifiers for DH Open Leipzig 2016 and DH Masters Malm 2016 , which were played in 2016 .

Let 's figure it out . <p> In the match for reaching the next stage , our five took a risk and picked Batrider . Moreover , it was the fifth pick and it can be said that it had a decisive impact on the result of the second map .

Despite his low hit damage , he feels rather well in 1v1 situations . He 's also doing good on the hard lane . His main feature is flexibility .

Rapidly examining the pick , you can easily notice a quite mobile Io + Tiny combo and the AoE control absence of the rival 's choice . In addition to this , PRIES ' pick was aimed at team fights : all heroes of the team 's lineup show do way better in team fights than in the single combats . In such a situation the choice of a solo disabler seemed more than smart . We should n't forget the fact that it was Shachlo to play Batrider in this match and that is one of his signature heroes . The character itself is not a star in the current patch .

@@36245430 @5245430/ <h> -Explorers League-+ Adventures Analysis <p> Nikolai -NickChipper-+ Velichko in his blog has shared his impressions on the new adventure in Hearthstone . <p> Hello , dear fans of Hearthstone . It is HellRaisers and NickChipper here . And today I would like to discuss a new addon , new cards and new meta . <p> What , how and why ? To begin with , the new adventure and news cards have just appeared , and we have n't got many cards yet , but we already have a few absolutely new and interesting decks . You might have seen Rogues with Summoning Stone , Shamans with Rumbling Elemental , Mages with Forgotten Torch . Moreover , I would like to give special attention to two cards . The first one is very cool and one of my favorites in this addon . It has the new Excavation mechanic Jeweled Scarab , and the second one is the new legendary Reno Jackson card . <p> Excavation is a mechanic where you chose one of cards from neutral ones or a pool of your class , whether this be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark the fact that this class-specific card always appears in this choice what ca n't be said about neutral cards . That is what I had liked before the expansion was released . <p> Beast with 1-1 characteristics for 2 mana ! In addition you dig up a creature for 3 mana ! Yes , Hunter comes to mind . Since he has always had problems with card setting up . Blizzard has just announced such a mechanic that if your hand is empty , you get a bonus . But in this game usually wins the one to have cards in the hand . Thus , I suggest you a variant of new Midrange Hunter which I personally got the 20th legendary rank from the 1720th position with . <p> Hunter ( clickable picture ) <p> Simple Midrange Hunter with two Houndmasters and his big synergy with beasts . Ram Wrangler and Snake Trap make this synergy even stronger . Rapidity of fire is changed to Jeweled Scarab you will always have cards in your hand with these bugs , and the rapidity of fire with 3 damage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing this deck and comment on using Jeweled Scarab yourself . <p> Let 's take a look at the sweetest spot of the first quarter of Explorers League Reno Jackson . This card is the one to relieve the meta of the game . New Warriors , Shamans , Druids , even Hunters with Reno Jackson . And the main and the strongest variant of the deck for this hero is Warlock . He is getting the first place of the meta at the legendary rank . I would say that the Reno Jackson meta has become similar to the arena in some way . : ) Since in our deck there are 28-30 different cards , it becomes more interesting to play . There are quite a few variations of Warlocks with Reno Jackson : someone uses Ragnaros , others play with Doomsayer , and there are those who make use of Explosive Sheep . Though the matter of the deck does n't change many traps , temps , cards and there are always additional 20+ hp for 6 mana . It is a very good card . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Warlock ( clickable picture ) <p> In the end of this short review of the Explorers League first quarter , I want to recall a card of the very Warlock Dark Peddler . This card does enhance cards of all classes , and especially Zoolok . It always gets the top 3 of best cards of the first quarter ! <p> As for the second quarter it 's pleased us with a wonderful legendary card called Brann Bronzebeard which makes battle-cries of your creatures work twice . From now on at the ladder you can meet many interesting decks with this deck , and it is something in a combo with Antique Healbot ! Moreover , Mill Rogues always are satisfied with this , since now an opponent takes four cards instead of two ! However , it does n't always play into the hands of yours . Also interesting combinations of Warlock with this card have been noticed , which are really strong themselves . We will talk about this later . <p> Thanks everyone who has always been with us , always with HR ! Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

And today is the day , when we are ready to publish the answers . Enjoy reading ! <p> kapral : Hi , Emil . Could you tell about your and team 's the most essential rivals ? Are there teams you ca n't allow to lose to and doing your best not to let it happen ? kUcheR : Hello . We do n't have such essential rivals , but we always want to get through the qualifiers here , in CIS . That means beating such rivals as Natus Vincere and Flipsid3 Tactics . <p> Oksvord : What goals are the team and you personally aimed at ? kUcheR : The goal of the team is to reach the upcoming major tournament , which is to run in two months . <p> dasISTfakT : Hello . Firstly , I want to say thank you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally , Emil . I wish you the best in your family life , health and prosperity . And the stability , confidence and wins for the team , since you can be the best . My question is what is the atmosphere in your team , since you often face a flaw of negative comments due to lost games ? Does it have a big impact on you and do you often listen to the constructive comments , which appear in the comments sometimes . And for the final , are you going well preparing for the autumn stage of games ? Have you prepared something new for us and the opponents ? Thanks for attention ! kUcheR : Thanks a lot . We have a great atmosphere in the team . We read both positive and negative comments ( the last ones do n't have a big impact on us ) . We are getting more upset by losing . Now we are going to the bootcamp on our base in Kiev and started training hard , since the major tournament is on the bows already : ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESEA Pro League Season 2 ? Do you prepare new tactics ? Are you sure you will show the best result ? kUcheR : Before the previous ESL we had known the map and the rival and always would prepare some different tricks and anti-tactics for them . It 's seen by the result against the top teams ( when we won NiP , fnatic and other teams with a 2:0 score ) <p> g0dl1k3 : Good evening , Emil . My question is : are you going to change the roster ? And my personal question : how long have you been playing CS ? Have you been playing 1.6 before ? What teams were you playing for ? Thanks for your attention . kUcheR : We are not going to make substitutions in the team . I 've been playing CS for 12 years . The most memorable team was Je . KerchNET ; it was the team I started winning different tournaments with and broke into the esport . And , of course , the DTS team ; it is the team I will always remember ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team with : ) <p> Forget : What are the demands to make it into the esport ? kUcheR : You have to play a lot ! This is the only thing that will help ypu . And , of course , you have to be lucky a bit to get noticed and invited for the test . This how It happened with me . <p> 12345 : I 've noticed many times that either you or ANGE1 , for example , pick up AWP and play very strong with it , and your team sniper is doing his best himself . Therefore I 've got a question : are you training all weapons together or it is up to everyone to decide what weapon to play with . Could you consider yourself to be able to play with any weapon ? Or is it just about aftershocks of your last skills and the luck factor ? kUcheR : - I pick up AWP , since I used to play with this rifle for 10 years . : ) This is not hard for me to take it and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He likes shooting with it , but neither me nor ANGE1 are not training AWP at the moment . <p> 12345 : I remember how I was synchronouslythrowing up my arms with you for each gained round at the APM grand final . Are you that emotional in the real life , too , or was it just a gaming , drive moment ? kUcheR : - " Yeah , I 'm emotional and cheerful in the real life , too , a bit . : ) Sometimes it helps the team , sometimes it does n't . <p> 12345 : It is written that you traing for 10 hours . Is to hard to combine the private life and esport ? kUcheR : - " - . Yes , I do train a lot and I 'm very happy with my second half , since very often she supports and helps me . <p> Parfen : How did mou get used to the team ?

I 'm also willing to make in into the big esport , but I 'm 14 years old . I have the big experience of playing CS and take part in the SLTV amateur league . Say hi to ANGE1 . : ) <p> kUcheR : I was studing and playing at the same time . When I started to play , I was about your age . I played a lot and my mother always was against this , but when I came to Moscow to the ASUS final and won it , having got the first place and a good money for that time ( at that time the prize fund was given with cash ) . After that my parent believed in me and now only supports me . <p> 12345 : Very often there is the situation when you have to come out from short on dedust2 and kill an enemy on goose or the ramps ; on overpass you have to come out from the short and kill a guy at the drums or behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train such default fire-fights ? If so , how do you do that ? kUcheR : We play a lot of mix games , and in these games we train these fire-fights . You shoud play even matchmaking this way . Always train your favorite positions and tricks , which you learn from pro players . <p> DoKeR : How do you feel about the fact that almost everyone in the team is from different counties or cities ? kUcheR : Sometimes it gets in the way . For example , when the boys in Kazakhstan , we face the ping problems . In official matches it affects their game . But in general it is okay and there is nothing bad about this . <p> artm1- : Hi , Emil ! Do n't you think that you have overtrained before the qualifiers for Cologne and came to the tournament too ready and due to this lost ? Will you change the way you traing before the next major tournament ? kUcheR : No . We were training in a normal way . I think we did n't overburn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a too random format .

HellRaisers will attend Dreamhack Winter 2014 . <p> Precisely one year ago in Jnkping was first held a tournament with a such great prize fund . For that time a quarter million dollars in prize money for the tournament on CS : GO was considered a huge breakthrough . Nobody would be surprised now by such an amount , but more money is not played out yet on any championship on Counter-Strike . The huge number of records was beaten for all history of Dreamhack tournaments . Beginning in 1994 from a little tournament in the cafeteria nearby , for 20 years it became a major cyber-festival of all times . <p> Jnkping first was the site of event back in 2001 . This small town , located near Gothenburg , twice a year , attracts the attention of entire cybersport community . Best CS:GO-teams from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strongest one . This is not just a tournament between top teams . Here gathered a largest on the planet LAN-party of ordinary fans of cybersport , formed a giant-scale hangout of charged gamers . <p> But the main attention is focused on the 16 participants CS : GO-tournament . Every team went a long way to Sweden . Some could get into the list of DH Winter still in summer , breaking into the playoffs in the previous " Grand Slam+ - ESL One Cologne . Some went through long and tense online-qualifiers . Some got on the leaving train+ , winning LAN-qualifiers a couple days before the start of the main tournament . And some received an unexpected invitation from organizers . Anyway , the large list of applicants for the title is already formed . This article will tell you what HellRaisers are able to show at Swedish event . <p> Action plan <p> Our team by the sortition got into the group A , which is honored to open up the tournament . It means , that DH Winter starts with the fight against hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 13:00 --- ( 14:00 Kiev TIME , 15:00 Moscow TIME ) . <p> Schedule of matches in group A : <p> Thursday , November , 27 <p> 12:00 --- fnatic vs Bravado <p> 13:00 CET Cloud 9 vs HellRaisers <p> 14:00 CET winner of pair 1 vs winner of pair 2 <p> 15:00 --- loser of pair 1 vs loser of pair 2 <p> 16:00 --- winner of pair 4 vs loser of pair 3 <p> The system of carrying out a group stage already became habitual . GSL-format allows every team to make not more than one mistake , i.e. allows to lose not more than one match in the group . In case the team fails twice - it loses the chances of entering playoffs . <p> Group A considered as one of the strongest on tournament . After a cheating scandal two French teams were disqualified , but all members of group A stayed untouched . Therefore , the most hot struggle is expected especially in our group . <p> Saying objectively , the South-Africans from Bravado Gaming look as an obvious outsider . These guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gesture is not really the recognition of their high level of play . This team has never attended any major tournaments and all their experience gained through the Internet . Considering the geographical location of South Africa , they could fight only against African teams . <p> I will agree with Andrew B1ad3+ Gorodensky , it is impossible to play powerfully having not visited any serious LANs . Most likely , Detrony&amp;Co will not have anything to oppose their opponents in the group and they will leave the tournament with two defeats . But the participation of this team will significantly expand the audience of DH Winter 2014 , because in terms of eSports the black continent+ was still not presented . Now the African audience will have at least the one , who cheer for . <p> All the other teams : fnatic , Cloud 9 and HellRaisers will fight for two permits to the playoffs . <p> The favorite of this three is fnatic team . These Swedish guys are in good shape lately : they triumphed at last four LAN-tournaments they visited . They began from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at FACEIT League Season 2 , ESWC 2014 and finally at Fragbite Masters 3 . There is still no vaccine can be found against these guys lately . They confidently overplay all their opponents . <p> HellRaisers are also not an exclusion . On five last maps , played against JW&amp;Co , there was only one win within the online tournament Caseking of the Hill #9 , where were many DDoS attacks . With new roster our guys still have not overcome fnatic on LAN-tournaments . The last meeting of these teams face-to-face was in France , where fnatic forced HellRaisers to pack their suitcases already at quarterfinals stage . <p> The Scandinavian style of play is identical to HRs . They allow much freedom on the map , acting relaxedly and unpredictably ; they allow themselves to act alone , winning due to the advantage in shooting . Some teams like NaVi and NiP , found their approach to fnatic , that allows them to compete the black-oranges equally . Our team in anticipation of the tournament used the help of tactics coach , therefore , certainly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our renewed style of play will surprise fnatic , our guys will have all the chances to overcome the stubborn Swedes . <p> Another affair is that in order to have a personal duel with the hosts of tournament , it is needed to overplay a high-level Americans from Cloud 9 . The representatives of transatlantic CS:GO culture have a great experience of performing at European LAN-tournaments , they attended all major events in the history of CS:GO , and they always were a serious threat even for most powerful teams . At all tournaments with prize pool of $250,000 these guys entered playoffs , often leaving very titled teams overboard . <p> The history of HR confrontation with Cloud 9 is very weak . There only one match that was precisely one year ago in quarterfinals of Winter 2013 . Then the Americans managed to win the match 2:1 , losing the first map . Then semphis proved himself well and he still plays for that team . <p> To the championship in Sweden these guys prepared in the same country . More than a month of bootcamp in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , time zone , computers and have a plenty of practice with European teams . We can say that Hiko&amp;Co almost assimilated with fives from the Old World , gained experience in games against strong teams ( there a few such opponents in USA ) . This team long ago moved from the category of unpredictability in the category of Learning : there are sufficient number of demos on which to draw conclusions about the playing style of Yankees+ . <p> B1ad3 in his pretournament interview called these guys overestimated+ . Following his words , the main feature of their game is an extraordinary courage in making spontaneous decisions , that needed for learning how to control , and then it will be not hard to turn the game against Cloud 9 in own advantage . But what if Cloud 9 could change during the month of active practicing ? What if they have not wasted their time , managed to find and eliminate the gaps of their own tactics and are going to appear renewed in Sweden ? Shroud&amp;Co the worthy team to be aware of , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the variant when fnatic will not get out of the group ? I would not say that this is far from reality . There are two teams against fnatic , which are able to morally+ pull out any game . Both of them , HellRaisers and Cloud 9 very seriously prepared for DH Winter . But recently VAC-ban series among pro-players very strongly presses on fnatic . Many associate a series of successful performances of the team with new generation of workshop-cheats and suspect fnatic leaders in using of forbidden software . If those suspicions true , we will see the recession of Swedish playing quality . But in case if these talks around wards of Devilwalk are just words , JW&amp;Co will have a good motivation to prove themselves . <p> How HellRaisers prepared for the tournament ?

SFZ almost always ban Leshrac , and have fewest wins with the hero called Clockwerk .

What are your favorite heroes and why ? Afoninje : I think I can play any role , though I am not really experienced in playing supports . SF is very powerful and " snowball " , and if it does n't go well on the middle lane , you can always get your items in the woods . Puck because of many buttons , he is very mobile and dynamic . Templar Assassin - since she is very strong in this patch , and she is underestimated . And again she is good in farming the ancients . Queen of Pain just because this is a classic . We jump far , scream painfully " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are a multiethnic team foul up ? Afoninje : We do n't have any problems with it everyone knows Russian in a good way . Moreover , I think this international problem is kind of exaggerated , in many teams a weak knowledge of a language does n't stop from achieving good results . <p> indie : If not HellRaisers , then what team would you play for ? Where would you feel comfortable as much as you do now ? Afoninje : Probably in a team like Secret , where there were not any sponsors , and there was some special atmosphere , very friendly relationships , freedom of action . <p> deadab1234 : How do you like new stand-ins ? Afoninje : Yet it 's been okay . We practice , speak , the atmosphere is rather positive . We want to achieve results , please our fans . <p> Bombazok : What is your current MMR ?

In this month I will try to build up a good computer and finally start streaming . <p> Kadzicu : Do you have a dream ? Afoninje : Oh , what a question ... In general everyone has their own dream . And this is something private that you do n't always want to talk about . But when you achieve this , you do want to share it with others . Talking about dota , my goal is the same as most dota players have , it is to win The International . <p> Rendom : What languages do you know ? Does it help you in your life ?

Though there is a thought that even if you do n't know some language , you can explain everything with gestures . <p> Ipiphan : Did you want to keep the old roster with Artes , Gorec , Goddam , Dread and -- ? Afoninje : I will not tell the reasons , but no , I did n't want to save it for sure . <p> Jordisson : If you are called to play 1 versus 1 on the middle lane , will you chose Shadow Fiend or Puck ?

@@36245453 @5245453/ <h> STYKO : HellRaisers is What I Have Been Looking For <p> We bring to your attention the interview with a new player of our CS:GO team " STYKO ! <p> We 've interviewed a new player of our team , STYKO . He 's told about his thought on his favorite game . <p> Hello , STYKO . To begin with , could you tell our readers about yourself ? How long have you been playing CS and why did you chose it ? <p> Hello I am Martin STYKO+ Styk , a player of the HellRaisers CS:GO team , and I am a 19 years old guy from Slovakia . I have been playing CS 1.6 for about 5 years at the low level and CS:GO since the beta release at a bit higher level . Now I am battling with top players with my team . <p> Many people are wondering how you 've got into the HellRaisers team . Were n't you afraid of playing with people , who spoke another language ? <p> I got an offer from LMBT to join HellRaisers after their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team and after some thinking the coach of HR decided to give me a chance . Everything started to click after a few days and there were a lot of improvements in a short amount of time , so we stuck with the same lineup and played together . I was not afraid of other language in the game . I had had some offers from Russian-speaking teams before and I tried to learn as much as possible to not be in disadvantage during the game . That and a great attitude of kucher , angel and LMBT helped me and oskar a lot on this matter . <p> Was it easy to switch to CS:GO ? How different is the Global Offensive gameplay from the Source and 1.6 one ? <p> It was not that hard for me . I kept reading those comments how CS:GO would never get big and proplayers would just retire but I personally liked it . I played it with GuardiaN a bit and we decided to give it a try . Game has changed since then but I love it more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of new weapons have appeared with the CS:GO release , for example M4A4 and CZ75 . What do you think , are these innovations justified ? <p> I simply like this . In previous CS there was really nothing innovative in terms of guns . We saw maybe 10 guns in competitive games in total . Now we can see anything from a range of the cheap P250 to the powerful auto sniper every game . You have to think what gun you face off against , and that increases the skill cap for everyone . And that is something we need in this game . <p> What is your favorite weapon ? Leaving out the A4 and m4 , of course . For example , what pistol do you like playing most and why ? <p> This is pretty straight forward . I would say it is Deagle from a pistols option because of oneshots . MP7 from a SMG option because of being a great farmgun . Probably the galil/famas ( leaving AK47/M4 and AWP ) from a Rifles option . <p> Valve easily change maps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decobbleston- ? <p> For me it is great that Valve add a lot of new maps . I would not mind having 10 maps in rotation . The higher amount of maps the higher skill cap there will be in the game . As I said , that can only help the competitive game . Cobblestone is an awesome map , probably one of my favourites . Train is map I never really liked because of lack of wallbangs in CS:GO but that can change anytime and I will like it more , hopefully . <p> In general , what map do you like playing most and why ? What was your first map in this game ? <p> As I said , I like cobblestone , then it is overpass , cache , season . I like the structure of those maps . I think the very first map I played was dust2 . Obviously every server ran dust2 in beta days so that is why . <p> How much time do you allocate for training ? What exactly do you practice and consider as the most important thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes every day and 1 hour if we have important official matches . I need a warmup if I want to play well . I just ca n't play without it . I usually play a DeathMatch mode , or aim maps with bots , or just simply surf on surf maps . I discovered a basebuilder mode a few weeks ago and it showed me funny alternatives to get warmed up . For me it is always important to stay calm and have fun . That is what I try to practice Have fun ! ! ! <p> What is the most important aspect of a team ? Is it the atmosphere or game level ? <p> It is a mix of both I think . You can not have a great team when teammates are constantly fighting but on the other hand you can not have a great team while everyone is joking around and having too much fun because you play with your close friends . You have to find that golden middle pathway . <p> Let our readers find our more about you recall a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hipster in this kind of matter . I always loved singleplayer games and I always hated shooter games , yet I am a pro player in CS:GO . I loved RPG singleplayers or middle age simulators or roguelike games and what not . Some of the most known are obviously Skyrim , Oblivion . Some of those simulators are The Guild 2 : Renaissance or Europa 1400 : The Guild . I like Faster Than Light , This War of Mine , Do n't Starve as roguelike games . <p> How good is esport developed in your country ? <p> It used to be an unknown term in CZ/SK Scene but now it is showing its potential . We have more viewers , more tournaments and it is leading into the right direction . In a few years it will be under skin of regular people and they will have a clue of what this e-sport is about . But we will have to wait and time will show what it will bring to our community . <p> Do you know any teams from Slovakia , that plays at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think anyone can go international from our scene . That is why I gave up and tried to look for international team for a some time . HellRaisers are finally something I have been looking for . <p> Name three new strong players from your homeland and tell about them a bit . <p> I can name only " young " players , they are not really new . Obviously there are my ex-teammates Zero and queztone who are both young but that is about it . I never saw potential in any young player in my country so I will have to stick with just 2 names . Sorry . <p> And ultimately , you 've already been to Ukraine together with oskar . What is your impressions of the country ? <p> It was my first trip to Ukraine and I have to say Kiev is full of contrasts . On the one hand a beautiful and modern airport with signs of wealth and on the other the entrance to Kiev made me think the city 's got stuck in the past . Obviously I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet there are a lot of modern parts as well . I just have n't got a chance to see them yet .

Will you say a few words to your fans ? <p> Thank you as well , it was great to answer your questions . I wish you had more of them ! I want to thank everybody who stands behind us in tough times and also those who cheer for us every time we play . Also thank sponsors such as ASUS ROG , Twitch , CSGOSkinny and Kiev Cyberarena .

Team Liquid can not come up with their fifth player , while Team YP have taken the two Poles , with whom there will be some problems in communication ( it 's a weird decision , by the way , to give the role of the in-game leader to one of them ) .

@@36245491 @5245491/ <h> Heart-cry , executed work , and all difficulties <p> Sergey -lmbt-+ Bezhanov told about everything , which has recently happened to the team . <p> So , it is July 14 of 2015 , 5:24 am in Kiev . The Linkin Park Roads Untraveled song is in my headset . <p> Well , let 's begin <p> I have arrived in the team in May , right before the Dreamhack France tournament . It was to begin in 5 days , and at that time we took everything we managed to from this championship . Then the routine work began and I started getting used to the modern CS world . It couldnt be the same one I remembered , while playing , training and being a manager . At the moment , when we started the networking , 7 online leagues with a best-of-three format in most of them were going at the same time . Can you imagine this ? I will draw a small conclusion of those two months . <p> During a few months , including LANs , we played about 150 official matches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get that we would play 2-3 official games ( bo1 , bo2 , and bo3 ) every single day . For those , who do n't  work at office , but at corporates or who is a taxi-driver , I will explain that a professional player has to spend 8 out of 12 hours at his working place , being focused on a game and trying not to make a mistake . The reason of it is that every fail they make does affect your emotions , our results and , actually , our earnings . Have any of you tried to be at the wheel about 12 hours per day within 6-7 days in a week ? If you have n't , try it yourself . You may spend even more time at the computer , but the difference is that you do n't  feel this responsibility or any other factors , which professional players face all the time . You can let yourself have a rest or some liberties . We are not the only prisoners of this situation , but all teams from top12 have to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose matches from time to time . Our average win rate is about 55% during this period , which is not that bad , considering the rivals we are going up against . Yes , fnatic and TSMs winrate is higher than 65% , and that made them a top1 team . <p> During this time we have played all 7 maps . We have chosen our prioritized ones and made them our signature . <p> I do not want to write about routine things , so I will mark out only the most important ones such as Fragbite Masters 4 and ESL ESEA Pro League . <p> I personally made a task to reach the Fragbite Masters 4 LAN Finals , considering the fact that all top teams were taking part in the tournament , except for Ninjas in Pyjamas . We have accomplished the task , but we did n't  have enough experience for LAN Finals , funny as it may appear , playing in this roster . We were training in a 4+1 format , since mou had to make a visa for Sweden ( all members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two years ) . We seemed to be really in good shape and with a mappool against all teams , but we did n't  manage to close our map against Team Solomid . The third map would have been train , which we had been very well prepared for in a game versus TSM . I cant say that we drew some serious conclusions after that tournament , since we just did n't  have time for that , but some things we did make a mental note of . After that the team faced some big troubles , which were not possible to omit . <p> In the process of taking off to Sweden , Misha paid a fine and we had already known that he is going to Moscow from Stockholm , since under the present legislation it is not that easy to make a PRC in Ukraine . We knew that he would have to spend 3 months without us , while the games in different leagues , including ESL , were not going to stop at all . <p> At the moment , when Dosia arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this fact , got back to Kiev , we had to play the match marathon within ESL ESEA Pro League , which we postponed . It was about 10 matches in 3 days , or saying another words , in half a season . Perhaps , you know that the maps are chosen randomly within ESL at the beginning of a season . When we saw a mappool of our rivals , we were really frightened . If you are interested in CS , you will get this picture . We had to play with fnatic two times on overpass , with mouz on dust2 twice , two time against Titan on inferno , with TSM on mirage , with Virtus.pro on mirage again , against Ninjas in Pyjamas on dust2 , with PENTA Sports on cache , with Natus Vincere on inferno and cobblestone . The map pick was so gloomy that we , to be honest , did n't  even built up hopes for this league , but decided to fight as hard as we could , come what may . <p> When we got back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it was 4 victories and 6 defeats . However , we did have a chance to reach the LAN stage . I will try to describe the situation we had to get through . We , actually , could lose only one map out of 12 ones left , we had to win Natus Vincere with a score of 2:0 , 2:0 against Virtus.pro , play 1:1 with TSM , and beat fnatic , Titan , PENTA Sports and mousesports , which by that moment gained momentum on that unfortunate dust2 . <p> HellRaisers 14:16 EnVyUs @overpass I guess , everyone remembers that miss by mou in the back with a ping of 120 , when the score was 14:13 in our favor . I just want you to understand that every single moment we painfully remember in our own way . <p> HellRaisers 12:16 mousesports @dust2 HellRaisers 14:16 Titan @inferno HellRaisers 16:11 Flipsid3 @cobblestone HellRaisers 13:16 Dignitas @train If someone has forgotten , in this match , when the score was 13:14 ( we were on the CT side ) , Pimp managed to take a 1 vs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we just presented this round , and in addition to it 3 points to the Dignitas team . <p> The first day : we had four matches , without a victory in which we would have nothing to do in that league . But we managed to accomplish this task . Although it was n't very clear , we definitely did our best . <p> The second day : we knew what we would have at that day . I woke up with some kind of anxiety , which is not a common thing for me at all . I was worried as much as when I was playing my first foreign tournaments . Having come to our prac room , my first words were : Boys , well do it+ . Emil was like : I want to believe , but how ? + . And I just said : Do your work and believe me . Yes , we will beat Natus Vincere on cobblestone , and I do know how to do that . And , yes , today we will do away with fnatic on overpass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that game we took a needed number of rounds on the CT side , and the very serious key round was taken by the Capitan of our team in the attack . You can watch this , I would say , incident : <p> The day started in the best way possible . We made our first step . Every victory in this league would mean nothing without the followed one , as well as every defeat aggravated the situation and the next victories would be useless . <p> HellRaisers 16:7 fnatic @overpass We had been ready for the first match with fnatic on overpass , but the mous equipment failed us . He was in Kazakhstan at that time and while updating a client , his Windows crashed . In all situations before the organizers would postpone matches , but we turned out to be an exception . Okay , let 's forget about this . As I have already said , we were ready , we really were , and even the players would say that it was very easy to play , since they just knew when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wont say that it was an easy victory , but we did n't  face any difficulties in that game at all . <p> HellRaisers 16:10 Titan @inferno Here we had a similar situation . We had learnt the game so good that , having taken only 7 or 8 rounds on the CT side , we just destroyed the rival , not using any prepared round . <p> HellRaisers 17:19 Team Solomid @mirage I will write a bit more about this game . In 4 days before we lost to TSM within Fragbite Masters with a score of 1:14 in the attack on mirage and drew some conclusions . I did n't  watch records of other games , I just looked at how these boys killed us . Yes , this is their best map , and yes , this is our worst map , but in Sweden we had to play 9 out of 10 gun rounds in a 4 vs 5 format , since a rivals sniper , karrigan , always managed to get an entry kill at any part of the map . <p> We completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10:5 in the attack , which is considered to be a cosmic result in the game against this team on any map , and especially on mirage . Then we faced real problems and nut the luck of playing experience , but the practice , which we just did n't  have time for . But ! We had 2 match points , in which we had to close the game . In that fatal round , in which we knew that they had only a few grenades left , we were in the majority from the beginning of the game , but made a huge positional mistake . I wont say the names , but they know what they did , even though it was n't that easy to admit the mistakes . <p> Unfortunately , the day ended with a fail , but a fairy tale was so close <p> Having lost mirage to Virtus.pro with 8 match points in the attack , we knew that our chances were rather illusive . Even if we had won all matches , nothing would have depended on us , since our rivals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We managed to beat Natus Vincere in the tough match on inferno , but did n't  take the points away from Team Solomid on cobblestone . And I do regret to say that we did n't  win Virtus.pro , since Misha was being ddosed , when the score was 12:13 . <p> We took the 6th place in the European division , which is a very considerable result . Now pay your attention to the scores , dear fans and the people , which are used to write some bad things in the comments . Tell me know , that this team paid out somehow or gave up . We were completely defeated only in one match against Team EnVyUs during the whole season . And the match with fnatic the team had to play with Vlady . <p> As a conclusion I can say that we are able to meet competitions and although our team is n't stable yet , we can beat any rival in a good day . <p> Then it was Starladder with stand-in players . The tournament was very pleasant of course and good , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this championship , unfortunately , turned out to be not only a cold shower , but a horrible reality of a fact that we just had to throw everything we had been working for away . <p> Right after that everyone went home . We made visas and took a rest , since during 2 months I can count only 8 days off work . <p> The problems are not going to leave us . Today our preparation to the major tournament is to begin , but Misha is in Ufa right now , but at least with a well-equipped place . Thanks to the organization for that and to Misha for the understanding and his attitude . Unfortunately , at the beginning of our so-called 4+1 bootcamp , mou had to get back to Kazakhstan to try and get a visa again , since the first try was refused . <p> But even all these difficulties do not affect our mood . The team will be working from 1-2 p.m. to 2 a.m . I also want to mention the purposefulness of some players as Emil , who to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 2 a.m. during a week and a half . Such things inspire not only me , but the teammates . Thanks to you , Emil . I do like such peoples attitude towards the process . Daur did please us with his coming and clearing up the schedule ( how much he will sleep , when he will get up , what he will be doing and what he will be working on ) . It does n't  touch Kirill and Misha at all , since these boys are on the same page . They always understand and are willing to work . Unfortunately , all difficulties lied on the young player 's shoulders , which has to flight in and out , suffering from clock zones . He s ping is 120 , and that makes his moves in the game in a way harder . Its a pity that a player with such desire and potential has to endure these fails and practically miss out on the opportunity to train for the main tournament in his life at this moment . <p> I 'm also very grateful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our families , wives , children and organizations , which always stay loyal to us and our beginnings .

( towards possible reshuffles etc . ) ANGE1 : My favorite team is HellRaisers , the player is s1mple . ; ) As for the map , I do n't know , it depends on the shape of our team . As for the least favorite ones , it is difficult to answer . It is harder of course to communicate with foreigners than with Russian-speaking players , but we are not writing an article , we are going to play CS:GO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common language here . As for NiP , I think some changes may do good for them . <p> Loyd : ANGE1 , is it possible to meet with you , when you are in Kiev ? ANGE1 : It depends on what you mean by meeting : if you are about drinking a beer , then recently I do n't really have time for that , and you should understand yourself that when you have such a hot schedule , you prefer spending these minutes with friends . However , if you want to chat , you can always find me at the bar in Kiev Cybersport Arena . I 'm okay with it . : ) <p> S1m0N : What are the relationships in the team , and particularly the atmosphere of the game ? Is it true that Sasha ( s1mple ) has become less aggressive and now behaves more like a team player ? How did oskar and STYKO hit it off ? Do you have problems with communication ? What language are they giving the information in ( Russian/English ) ? ANGE1 : The biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I think it is just a matter of time and we will fix this . Sasha is trying , but sometimes old s1mple wakes up , but as time goes by , I think he will understand that all his emotional splashes are not making anyone play better , and we have the same goal . <p> KirillSvs : Why and how did you chose the Slovak and Czech as your new teammates ? ANGE1 : We were watching records from the games , reading a lot of statistics , and these boys usually would show themselves in a good way . And since our play was just begging for new players , we decided to give the boys a chance and we do n't really regret about that . ; ) <p> 12345 : Hello , Kirill . In your team there is a coach and you as a captain . I want to know who is coordinating the moves of players : is it you or LMBT ? What is the Capitan responsible for in the team ? ANGE1 : It 's me to coordinate moves during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical preparation of the team and helps our legionaries to get used to all these things . There are a lot of responsibilities , but the top-priority ones are that I should lead the boys both in the game and out of it . <p> 12345 : I was also wondering why do n't pro players use the SG556 ( b-4-4 ) , since it has doubtless pluses before the AK-47 : a faster firing speed and 100% armor penetration ? ANGE1 : The dispersion and price are two crucial moments , that 's why it is not value at the professional stage . <p> ShouldPro : Would you like to get markeloff back into HellRaisers ? ANGE1 : At the moment I 'm pleased with the current roster of the team and would like to fix all inner nuances instead . : ) <p> PREDATOR : Have you , as a captain , ever thought that constant reshuffles just do n't give you any chances to achieve high results every season ?

How would you commend on the hasty leaving of MIkhail Dosia+ Stoliarov right before the major tournament ? ANGE1 : I would n't like to analyze this thing in details . I have a good relationship with Misha and I think that he might have had some reasons to leave the team . The only thing I do n't get is why he did it in 8 days before such an important tournament for us . <p> Vdikan : Hi , Kirill ! You 've become an idol of mine right after I saw you ! I would like to wish you only the best and ask : how were you studying at the university , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Monte : Do n't you think that everything that is going on with the team right now is a kind of a dead end and is not a development at all . I do understand when GuardiaN was leaving VP , you called him an excellent player , but the communication or the lack of it did its part and you decided to kick him . Now you 've taken two players like GuardiaN . Is it your last chance , the last try , the last charge before leaving to the family and ending the esports career in general ? I 'm naively hoping to see your sincere answer , though I do understand that you will not show your hand , but anyway . : ) P.S. Thank you for your entire career , I was learning to play CS:GO by your demos and have even grown to quite succesfully perform at the pro series . Good luck in your family , take care of your wife and doughter and do n't forget that CS is a game , and a family is life.ANGE1:I 'm glad my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question where you mentioned two players like GuardiaN . This player is in top three players of the world at the moment , and results of a good team directly depend on his shape . I hope sincerely that our new legionaries will show themselves not less successfully . I wo n't call it the last chance , vice versa , I 've just got in excellent shape and the next year should be a real breakthrough for CS in terms of prize funds and popularization . <p> 12345 : In one of last interviews you said that you found starting the game on a weak side more correct . Why , having won the side-pick , you chose a strong one , then ? ANGE1 : To start the game on a weak side you should be quite confident in it , and at the moment the team 's preparation is just not good enough . : ) 
@@36245493 @5245493/ <h> Maps that May Be in the Map Pool <p> 01 Dec 2015 <p> CS:GO is a changeable discipline . The developers regularly change weapons and game mechanics , change the location of objects on maps . But what if we change maps ? <p> If we take , for example , three tournaments , which were held under the ESL One banners ESL One : Cologne 2014 , ESL One : Katowice 2015 and ESL One : Cologne 2015 , then we will see an interesting tendency . In each tournament there was a different map pool train , nuke and season would replace each other in the fight for the place under the sun . Let 's see what maps can make it into the mappool in the next season . <p> desantorini <p> One of the most promising applicants to get into the mappool of tournaments of 2016 is a new work of Shawn ' ' FMPONE ' ' Snelling desantorini . Nevertheless , hardly this map can be called new in the days of CS 1.6 there was a prototype of the current map . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.6 versions , though they are quite important . The first thing to catch the eye is general lightness of the map . The second one is a presence of rapid access to the middle for both teams . That 's why the map kind of reminds good old-fashioned dust2 . One more feature is a relatively big number of paths for shifting which makes the attack side more plastic , while it makes the defense one play more aggressively . It can be said for sure that desantorini is one of the best applicants to be added in the mappool . <p> detuscan <p> One more old-timer map from CS 1.6 . Colin Volrath was the one to port it into CS:GO , and it took him almost two years to do that . Released in May of this year the map has not made it into the mappool yet , but everything may change with a new operation which should start very soon . detuscan itself is quite a nameworthy map its general scheme is rather simple , but you should spend quite a few hours to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important that we mark places to plant the bomb on , too they are located quite harmonically in reference to the map and have almost the same size , but the basics of their defending are in stark contrast to each other . Also on this map there is enough space for snipers with the AWP . In conclusion , detuscan will perfectly fit into the game and will be able to replace quite questionable new train . <p> deseason <p> One more work of Shawn ' ' FMPONE ' ' Snelling and not a new map again but a restyling of the old one . deseason was played in the days of CS:S and even in CS:GO was added sometimes in the mappool of some tournaments . Nevertheless , the map in CS:GO was just a copy of the one from CS:S and did n't have some noticeable features .

The decisive round was at score 11:13 in favor of Titan , when Maniac was left in the situation 1vs2 6 seconds till the end of the round and he managed not only to put a bomb , but also to kill both opponents .

And since I did n't  have Jaraxxus , there was n't a reason to pick second Shadow Flame . To make sure I also took one Zombie Chow to have more chances to win against aggressive decks and tempo mages+ . <p> Its noteworthy that Alexey neednt the second card called Force of Nature for the Druid deck . The presence of Zombie Chow do not surprise at all , since this card is used very frequently at the ladder , as well as at tournaments . <p> Alexey Lostov+ Fursov 's comment : <p> Druid is rather a common deck , too . I like playing this class , since it is stable and might work against any deck . 1 Zombie was taken to have less problems at the early stage of the game . Two Azure Drakes are an additional set of cards , and Swipe becomes a very strong spell in combination with it . Harrison laid there to help resist to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for a victory too though+ . <p> The last thing is that Alexey demonstrated his excellent Midrange Hunter , in which he switched two Webspinners to two Leper Gnoms , and explained it as The hero damage is more important+ . Moreover , Lostov used two Ironbeak Owls , which played the lead role in some moments . <p> Alexey Lostov+ Fursov 's comment : <p> Hunter . Here the commentators might have mistakenly assumed that it was a hybrid deck . Actually , it is just common Midrange Hunter with Houndmaster , Snake Trap , Mr. Boom etc . Leper Gnoms laid instead of Webspinners , since I found the hero damage more important than any useless chip beast or any unplayable card . Hunter in this meta works quite good against most decks+ . <p> That 's all you need for a victory . Do you want to win , as well as Lostov ? Do you want to conquer the ladder ? Pick up any Alexeys deck and do so . You will succeed for sure ! And do not be afraid of experiments .

After roster refreshing , on the way of HR there were no such a high level opponents , therefore the past match became a first serious test for durability . Whether our players coped with it ?

The score became close to disastrous , but in this hard moment for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARTES with support of his comrades managed to recoup six kills and like in real sports - to sober up+ their team . After several successful run-ups , Artes obtained the coveted Shadow Blade , he became even more mobile and more dangerous with that , snatching on opponents in the most improper moment for them . <p> It seemed that everything was adjusted , but Team Empire quickly enough stopped the rush of HellRaisers and with Necrophos Ultimate left our team without Slark for a long time . The score increased in favor of Empire+ 10:22 . It is unpleasant difference in frags , but the time factor was working for us . At the late stage , our pick looked more convincible , than the opponents one . <p> The twenty-third minute of the match was a turning point in the game HellRaisers managed to kill three opponents and to destroy the second tower at the upper line .

Pick of Team Empire was adjusted for team-fights+ , nobody would survive in case of proper performance there . For a very long time the game was quite equal and the situation seriously heated . To pleasure of players and fans of HR Team Empire poorly managed to play team-fights , therefore they could not realize their strong side and that used HellRaisers . However , our team had no so much time opponents immediately bought Midases+ , and that did heroes , who deal a bunch of damage at the last stage of the fight Void , OD , Weaver . <p> Once again , ARTES drew the attention this time he played Antimage+ . The purchase of Crimson Guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasting of gold , but Artyom proved the different . He increased the pace of HellRaisers and perfectly coped with his task . <p> After thirty-seven minutes of equal fight , Team Empire finally managed to organize the perfect attack on the Middle and then they totally destroyed HellRaisers . Awesome attack of Empire+ allowed them not only to take out all the heroes of our team , but also to destroy all the towers at the mid-line , exposing the barracks . <p> After the respawn of our players , Team Empire managed to hold a good team-fight+ and this time they destroyed all barracks at mid- and lower-line . Most of team in such situation often give up and surrender to the mercy of the winners , but HellRaisers did not give up and continued to do anything possible for victory . <p> With only one barrack in the rears , raised from hell+ excellently resisted to their opponents and could even do a teamwipe+ , but it did not bring too much of advantage .

Among them there are both offenders of our boys and the teams , which have recently updated their roster . The history of each of these fives is below . <p> The Norwegian team LGB eSports has recently ( in May of this year ) lost their best player , a statistical and moral leader Hsvard " rain " Nygaard . He has decided to join the Kinguin team and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parallel group . The young hope of Norwegian CS:GO , Kristoffer " Mystic " Michelsen , was invited to take the leader 's place .

Due to personal reasons Ruben " Rubino " Villarroel has to miss the German qualifier . We will be the one to found out how it will affect their style and quality of the game , since LGB eSports are the first rivals of HellRaisers . <p> The favorite of the pair , in which the next rival of our boys is to be determined , is the Polish team eBettle . This team was formerly known as INSHOCK ; the five is considered to be the third one by the strength in Poland . The future of the country 's stage is playing in this team .

We know a little about these boys : they are supported by the British organization , they visited only the LANs in Finland , but managed to beat such teams as LGB eSports , Phenomenon and nEophyte online . The last acquisition of the roster is Slaava " Twista " RSsSnen , who has the experience of taking part in big CS 1.6 tournaments . The team has been working as hard as others , and thus may become a serious problem for any team . <p> At the second part of the brackets there are a couple of favorites and a couple of outsiders . Although all these divisions are conditional , it 's necessary to point out that the Gamers2 - Titan pair seemed to be way stronger than the k1ck - ROCCAT one . <p> Let 's talk about everyone in turns . G2 is the discovery of the last few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent LAN Finals of SLTV StarSeries they turned out to be out of the play-off stage together with HR , but the Poles did n't manage to beat our five .

If G2 manage to win Titan , they will be on the highway to the winners bracket finals . <p> It is a big question though if Titan will become a serious obstacle . The French reshuffle , which caught the CS:GO stage up in a week before the tournament , having left Titans without the stable five , tactics and two best players - the sniper of the world level , Kenny ' kennyS ' Schrub , and the very qualitative aimer - Dan " apex " Madesclaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winter 2014 , Edouard ' SmithZz ' Dubourdeaux and Richard " shox " Papillon , have come to take their places . It 's almost impossible to build a good team play during such shot period of time , but their individual skill is good enough to get in victory at this qualifiers . <p> The history of the next couple of quarterfinalists is quite similar . Both teams made it to Cologne through the online qualifiers , both in a week before the tournament became part of new organizations and do want to approve themselves as good as they are able to at the upcoming LAN tournament . The second representative of Finland is the heritor of the CS:GO Finland leader 3DMAX . When Joona " natu " LeppSnen and Taneli " disturbed " Veikkola left the team , the ways of the updated roster and the organization broke away .

@@36245544 @5245544/ <h> Lostov about SLTV Kick-Off Season <p> Not so long ago I took part in the Hearthstone tournament called SLTV Kick-Off Season , which ran from June 30 to July 10 . Within this championship I managed to compete with the best players of this discipline and fight for a good prize fund of $9,900 . In this blog I 'm going to tell you about all my games in details and share my impressions in general . <p> Almost all popular players had been invited to this tournament directly . I , together with Renmen and two more boys from abroad , had to get through the qualifiers . KalaxZ and Boarkontrol managed to make it into through the open qualifiers , in which about 512 players took part . For that they do deserve respect . I did n't  participate in this tournament myself , but I got a chance to fight for a slot within the close qualifiers , in which the best 16 CIS players were to meet . As a result , I got this slot , having beat four opponents . I can say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matches of the Starladder main stage . <p> After a victory in the close qualifiers , I got an invitation from HellRaisers , which decided to sigh a Hearthstone division . I accepted the offer with pleasure and the last part of the tournament I was playing under their red flag . <p> Then the most interesting part began . It was the group stage time , in which I had already faced off against very experienced rivals . Let us recall that all games ran in a Conquest format . I used three decks at this tournament : Handlock , Midrange Hunter and Midrange Druid . <p> The first rival turned out to be the Swedish player under a nickname of Orange , which had already approved himself at the pro stage , having won a few big tournaments . Although I was at the lead with a score of 2:0 , the game was rather hard . Orange managed to put himself together and the result of the game depended on the last match with a score of 2:2 . The Swede started to act rather aggressively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Handlock with only two health points . Fortunately , I had both taunts and healers , so it was n't that hard for me to bring the score to the winning end 3:2 . <p> Then I had to go up against the thunderstorm of the ladder Xixo , who is famous with his breaking in+ the legend within first days of a season . In this series luck was surely on my side . A few good draws and I 'm celebrating my second victory at the tournament 3:0 . <p> After the group stage there were only 8 participants left in the tournament . The players got an opportunity to change something in their decks and chose absolutely another class . I did n't  try to make up something and kept the decks I had been playing at the close qualifiers . It was the beginning of the play-off stage , in which I had Amaz , an owner of the Archon team , as my rival . In turn he used an opportunity to change a deck and took Tempo Mage instead of Face Hunter . This mistake turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , and I made another forward step 3:0 . <p> The victory in the next game guaranteed to me reaching the top 3 of the tournament and this fact made it really special . However , the current world champion and top 1 player at the American region , Firebat , turned out to be an obstacle on my way . The games against him were definitely hard and I could n't be sure about any turn I made , and it became a reason of my defeat , since I made a lot of stupid mistakes . By the way , my rival drew very well and he did n't  lose his advantage until the end of the series . Unfortunately , I lost and fell into the losers bracket 1:3 . <p> At that time I did n't  have a right to make a mistake . The defeat in the next game meant leaving the tournament . By a twist of fate my rival turned out to be Orange again . He was definitely ready to take a revenge after our game in the group , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory in this series almost without any difficulties 3:1 . <p> There were only four opponents left at the tournament . To reach further I had to beat one more experienced American under a nickname of StrifeCro . To be honest , I expected in a way more intensive games , but my opponent was not in shape for sure . During the series he made a few questionable turns and I , in my turn , did n't  forgive him those mistakes 3:1 . <p> Actually , I could say a lot about this game . However , it will be better to watch it . In the series the score was being changed in such sequence : 1:0 in a favor of Kolento , 1:1 , 2:1 , and 2:2 . The winner was determined in the decisive fifth match , in which my Handlock faced off against Kolentos Rogue . Both of us had rather good hands at the beginning of the match , and a winner of that match was to be a player , who would draw a right card first . This player , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to find all cards he needed and in a few turns he put a dot in this series 2:3 . <p> At this moment the tournament came to the end for me and I took honorable third place . The second was Kolento , and Firebat celebrated his regular victory . These two players showed everyone again that they take high positions in the GosuGamers rating for the reason , having gracefully played the whole tournament . <p> Why did help me to get that high ? I think I should mention three factors here . First of all , decks . Making a decision before the tournament , I was watching what decks are most popular among top players and I tried to take some kind of counter-pick to those cards . The decks I picked I had been playing a lot in the ladder , and thus I felt confident playing in the tournament . Secondly , concentration . You might have noticed that I was writing something down , while playing . In this way I was marking the cards the rival and I drew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did help me to focus on the game and , relying on my big experience , deliberately entertain turns and make a minimum of mistakes . And , thirdly , luck . Its impossible to win something in this game without luck . It , of course , is n't that important as the experience and understanding of the game , but its worth mentioning apart . It was my first tournament of such level and I 'm glad I managed to perform so well and pleased my fans . <p> I want to add a few words about the broadcasting . Its a pleasure to see that a huge number of people was interested in watching the streams . If I 'm not mistaken , at some moment , at the final day , there were about 15,000 viewers . I do not remember another Russian-speaking channel collecting such a big number of people . This fact should let organizers see that a lot of gamers are willing to watch this . I 'm sure that we have to continue working in this direction . <p> At the end I want to express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HellRaisers organization for supporting and believing in me ! It was really pleasant taking part in the tournament in such atmosphere . I hope to please you with my new victories very soon !

Now the answers are ready and we are happy to present them to you . <p> Do not forget that now the selection of questions for our tanker Neskwi is still going on . You can ask your question here . <p> Rhythm : The question is : was it hard for you to get into the professional Dota ? How much time did it take from the start ? goddam : I play Dota for about 8 years and first six of them I did not plan to start a professional career . Simple public games and leagues . Everything started since I graduated from college and I was forced to either start working or to continue study . I said to my parents : " Give me one year , I will become a professional player and will earn money , then I will continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make all possible efforts in order to truly become a professional player . After my term almost ended , I was invited to KPG team and later we got into the professional Dota . <p> ua moikotlybitmoloko : After the match against Vega Squadron ( Dulat excelently played at middle then and HellRaisers defeated their oponent with 3:0 score ) do not you want to change you role in the game ? goddam : Team does not need for player to change their roles . May be sometime in the future I would play at the other position , but not in this roster . <p> Dypree : How is mood within the team and do n't you have a member that demoralizes the others ? goddam : Everything is fun , good and friendly . Even when we lost or something goes wrong in the game , we try to concentrate on the game and to help each other . We are not angels , everybody has own character , but we find common language . <p> Dypree:If Dread does so well playing with Vengeful Spirit , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent and universal hero ? For instance , you may use this pick ( or probably give her several key kills at the start ) , in order for her to get dagger/blademail ( or both , depending on situation ) for maximum aggressive game , maximum harm to opponents besides reducing of damage from the hero 's aura ? The combination of swap , stun , blademail in mass fight would allow her to cause more damage and to survive better , would n't it ? goddam : There are a lot of combinations , it is the main feature of Dota . Blademail - expensive and long-time getting . Plus none will attack her . They would wait and kill her later , because a support Venga has not much of HP . <p> Astana:Does Dota provide you financially , or it is just a hobby ? What 's your parents ' attitude to that ? Do you think is there professional Dota in Kazakhstan ? goddam : Recently I watched the movie Fury+ , where tankers repeted the phrase : The best job in life ! + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It fully provides me financially . I think if in Kazakhstan there is no professional team - there is no professional Dota in the country . <p> Mifistonitian:Who coordinates you during play ? goddam : We have pretty democratic team regarding this issue , we all the time exchange with opinions and try to choose the most optimal one . Here is our strength and our weakness . If somebody get out of theis idea generator and does not bring anything to the common success , then we risk to make wrong decision . But often the last word has Vanya ( Gorec ) . <p> dorin : What are you impressions from D2AC tournament ? goddam : Everything was alright , despite some errors of organizers . Very good experience . Certainly , it was confusin for us to withdraw in the first round of lower bracket . We were 5th in the group and then ended our performance at 9-12 places . It is hard to procced with such rules .

As person he is very funny and positive , as well as other teammates are . <p> klop354 : Who is from well known by you PRO-players came off with alcohol too much ? Tell us such story . Your personal fan - Georgiy. goddam : Unfortunately , I will not tease you with such stories .

But I was invited to play support role , therefore I just did not have a choice . <p> BrAve-DotA2:How to develop yourself as fast as possible to start professiona career ? How to improve the team in general ? goddam : My suggestion is to watch games of professional players .

The duel came to the end quickly , our guys won 5:1 , clearly overcoming the opponent , first of all on Prokhorovka . <p> After the game we asked several question to players of HellRaisers : <p> Prokhorovka a strong map of HR or a weak map of RoX.KiS ? What was the reason of such a destruction ? Whether you surprised to such an advantage or you knew for sure that your opponents can not do anything here ? <p> Bullkin : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything was decided in a shootout wall to wall , were rule such factors as skill and focusing . More balanced setup and good players are the reason of such result . We were not surprised , we played our game . <p> DYADOR : It is rather weaker map of Roxes . The reason of such destruction was tank T20 , which could not help anyhow in shootouts . <p> How do you evaluate your own results at the start of the Gold League season ? <p> Bullkin : Generally , the result is good enough . It is not perfect , but it is good that we have where to grow up ! Confidence and teamplay with every round grows and it pleases us , but there many opponent ahead , so we are not going to relax ! <p> This victory allowed HellRaisers to strengthen their position in the three of the best after four rounds .

Recently HellRaisers look rather strong , too , though not always : two draws with Team Empire and Liquid , but a loss to Natus Vincere all that may put in doubt , but we do believe that our team will show their best play in the upcoming best-of-three series .

Emil -kUcheR-+ Ahundov will help us with it today ! <p> According to Counter-Strike Wiki , the P90 is a submachine gun in Counter-Strike : Global Offensive . It is easily recognized for its unique bullpup design . <p> In general , the P90 is a Belgium-made weapon fed with 50 rounds of 5.7+28mm . It is well-known for its stable accuracy and low recoil even while moving and continuously shooting at the same time . Although its damage is relatively low . Let 's take a look at the pros and cons of this device ! <p> Pros <p> Cons <p> Large magazine size <p> High rate of fire <p> Lightweight <p> Low recoil <p> Low damage <p> Inaccurate at long ranges <p> Long reload time <p> Only two magazines in reserve <p> The most expensive SMG in game <p> The price of the weapon is $2350 , and it kills with one hit only an unarmored rival in his head . If the one makes himself safe , a shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , of course , deals less damage , though it does n't stop the P90 from being an incredibly dangerous gun . The full table of the damage is given below : <p> Hitbox <p> Damage <p> Unarmored <p> Armored <p> Head <p> 103 <p> 71 <p> Chest &amp; Arm <p> 25 <p> 17 <p> Abdomen <p> 32 <p> 22 <p> Legs <p> 19 <p> 19 <p> It is noteworthy that CS:GO is a game where players almost always buy the armor , and it does satisfy the P90 's owner , since the weapon has a big armor penetration and low recoil . Moreover , this gun gives you an opportunity to spray at a group of enemies . Even despite this technique , the P90 is doing great with the burst method , too . But you should not forget about its slow reload time , so it is important to control a number of rounds and , if needed , switch to a pistol , since it is way faster . <p> If you are playing against the P90 , it is also important to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distances , since that 's where his power shows up . Long ranges are not a strong suit of the P90 , so it is much more easier to beat it in such situations . At middle ranges the best choice is a submachine gun with lower recoil , which today 's hero loses out to . By the way , many new players , playing this weapon , can not control his recoil and thus give a chance to aim at their heads and make a few tidy shots . <p> What did the captain of the HellRaisers team say about this device ? Read below ! <p> Emil kUcheR+ Ahundov 's comment : <p> I am the only player in our team to use this weapon . I can say that I do like it due to its armor-piercing and wallbang power . In addition , a number of rounds in the magazine should satisfy everyone . Low damage is not a problem , since all his advantages make up for this disadvantage. +
