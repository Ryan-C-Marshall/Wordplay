@@34567153 @3567153/ <h> TV Review : Lemony Snicket 's A Series of Unfortunate Events <p> Lemony Snickets " A Series of Unfortunate Events " had its Netflix debut , and I could n't be more ecstatic . As someone who grew up reading the series and all its companion novels , all I ever wanted was for the story to be represented in its true light : a quirky , dark tale with many mysteries and characters who challenge age and gender stereotypes . The setting of the books is unknown : it is suggested several times that it takes place in the United States ; however their city is literally called " The City " and it takes influences from so many different time periods that it could really be anywhere , and at any time . This makes the world interesting and different from anything we have experienced . <p> In the books ( and in the Netflix series ) Snickets narration serves as a story in and of itself , and a way to keep children up-to-speed with more complicated words and phrases . The show was successful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids can follow along , while still keeping those parts entertaining and quirky for an adult audience . The show revealed a lot , very early on , and we get to see the mystery of VFD unfold as it happens ( as opposed to the books , in which we see the Baudelaires perspective almost exclusively , and we only have a few glimpses into mysteries that remain mostly unsolved ) . I 'm very excited to see how this will progress throughout the later seasons . <p> The show is also very visually appealing . The costumes are successful in being both character-driven , actually making sense for practicality ( while I loved Violets dress from the 2004 movie , she would never wear something like that ) and still working together as a cohesive unit . The set design blew me away with so many Easter eggs from the books . They even did things like making Eleanora Poes dress match the wallpaper of her kitchen . Although the green screen was campy , it did n't  distract me from the brilliance of this show . I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that this story does n't  exist in any specific time or place . It gave an unnerving feel to the show that is also present in the books . <p> My thoughts on the main characters : <p> Patrick Warburton as Lemony Snicket : I was a little skeptical at first when the trailers and behind-the-scenes photos showed his face , BUT the way that no-one in the show could see him is done so well . While he does n't  look quite the way I imagined Lemony Snicket , his voice has a dry humour that lends itself very well to the character and the overall tone of the story . <p> Neil Patrick Harris as Count Olaf : Such an epic performance . Count Olaf is supposed to be terrifying , yet funny in a ridiculous way . Not only does he nail Olaf , but he also does a fantastic job at acting out each of his disguises while still incorporating Olafs bad acting into those characters . <p> Malina Weissman as Violet Baudelaire : Violet is a teenager who finds herself forced into a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inadequate time and time again . She is the inventor : resourceful , and can make something useful out of almost anything . Malina keeps true to the character , and brings a fire to Violet that was n't present in the 2004 movie . <p> Louis Hynes as Klaus Baudelaire : Klaus is the researcher , whose thirst for knowledge has gotten him and his siblings out of many difficult situations . He can be reckless in his need to solve the mystery , and sometimes it gets in the way of better judgement . I really appreciate the hint of arrogance that Louis brings to the character : it fits the fact that Klaus , while being a very kind and intelligent person , is still a 12-year-old boy and does n't  quite have the wisdom that comes with time and experience . <p> Presley Smith as Sunny Baudelaire : Presley is one of the most adorable babies I 've ever seen . I love her incredulous expressions , especially at Aunt Josephines fear of cooking anything hot . Her lines are some of the funniest aside from Count Olafs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Youre a disgrace to your profession . " <p> Some other things I loved : <p> -The opening theme song " Look Away " , sung by Neil Patrick Harris ( Every episodes opening is slightly different ! Listen to them all ! ) - " That piece of cake is lemony " " I told you never to say that word ! " -The many VFD references ( all the spoken acronyms , and the eye insignia appearing everywhere ) are a great way to emphasize the impending importance of the organization . -The dedications to Beatrice -The awfulness of Mr. Poes entire family , and their cramped little kitchen inside their tiny squished house - " Oh , your mother remarkable woman . Flammable . " -The sudden musical number in the first episode - " Yessica Haircut " -The fact that Olafs minions are n't  as evil as he is , and their occasional surprise at Olafs actions suggests that he may have not always been this terrible ( and I 'm pretty sure I know why , but that 's a book spoiler ) . -Aasif Mandvi as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billy Connolly in the movie , but Aasif portrays Monty as slightly more intelligent and protective of the children . - " Herpeteloser " - " Godforsaken Nickelodeon " -The foreshadowing of Esme Squalor . -Mr . Poe freaking out over the Incredibly Deadly Viper " attacking " Sunny -The score and musical numbers are incredible , and I need them to release an album so I can buy 10 - " He had a very terrible childhood . " " Im having a very terrible childhood right now . " " OK .

It strays off the path of " normal " , and that is the show 's most shining quality .

Thus started my love affair with The Dread Crew - needless to stay , it was the still one of the best things to ever happen to me . <p> Since our first meeting , I have seen them perform at all manner of events - Ren Faires , local bars and venues , opening for some of my favorite metal bands - The band has an incredible energy , play awesome music , and are interesting people to boot .

We rock out pretty hard , and have a lot of onstage antics and theatrics . Rouba : The Dread Crew of Oddwood is a group of guys who sometimes casually play Magic : The Gathering WolfBeard : The Dread Crew of Oddwood is a group of Nautical Warriors bent on piracy , alcohol and hooking up with pretty girls .

And here 's the kickerevery single one of us was dressed like a pirate , to support the game 's nautical theme . So we went with pirate-inspired music , and , to stay true to being badass , we chose obscure acoustic folk instruments with which to titillate ( wo ) mankind 's senses . Thus , Oddwood was born , and evil was vanquished forever ! Smithy : I was just trying to float to America ( see : LONG ... ) when these guys picked me up .

And I got to put my Oddkit ( portable drumkit ) in the ocean for some shots , that , regrettably , did not make the final cut . Rouba : It was cool . Concept mostly came from the director , actually , not the band . WolfBeard : It was stressful , yet ultimately very rewarding . Lots of creative tension between band members and filmmakers .

When we 're plugged-in , we ca n't run around as much , but you get a lot more of the musical side of our performance .

Our fans are die-hard and we love ' em . For me , I can get away with lighting my Oddkit aflame or kicking the bastard over without worry of breaking expensive electric equipment at our acoustic shows .

I think Wolfbeard and I write the most , but everyone chips something in . WolfBeard : I get really drunk sometimes and then find scores with lyrics on them in my house . Rouba does this a lot too , but it 's usually from opium instead of alcohol . <p> Q : What has been the most memorable experience for you during your time in Dread Crew ? <p> Smithy : We 've been on tour three time .

We can probably thank the recent rise in geeky movies and TV shows for that , with shows like Big Bang Theory and the hugely popular superhero genre in movies this past decade . But we also can thank several celebrities who have admitted to being geeky and helped people realize we are not all a bunch of mouthbreathing shut-ins ( and it 's ok that some of us are ) . In fact , many of us are amazingly talented , funny , and creative people ! So let 's take a look at some of the greatest champions of geekdom who have helped us gain the respect we deserve : ) <p> 15 . Weird Al Weird Al was a nerd way before it was cool . And to be honest , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As if writing geeky parodies of songs was n't enough , he does it on the accordian , several of them in the terribly nerdy polka style . Admit it , once you hear a Weird Al version of a song you can never go back to hearing the original the same way . And with songs like White and Nerdy , The Saga Begins and Craigslist , and his movie UHF which parodies tons of geeky cinema , Weird Al is clearly our champion . He 's also had cameos in tons of cartoons and TV shows like The Simpsons , The Brak Show , Space Ghost , Robot Chicken , Johnny Bravo , Ren and Stimpy and more . I saw Weird Al once in concert when I was younger and even though I mostly attend metal shows , I will admit this was still one of the best concerts I 've seen . He did 100 costume changes during his set and it was a blast to go and watch . Weird Al is one of the geeks that helped pave the way for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> How many other geeky celebs can you spot in this video ? <p> 14 . Brian Posehn Brian Posehn is not a household name by any means . You may think of him as " That geeky standup comic with the nasally voice . " I love him not only for his work as an actor and a standup comedian ( I knew him originally from his work on Mr. Show and News Radio a million years ago ) , but his work in comics as well . He 's always been unapologetically who he is His standup includes bits about being a nerd , getting picked on , and things like Star Wars . He also , like me , is one of the rare geeky metalheads I 've seen him around both Comic Con as well as metal shows in the LA area , and he 's always incredibly gracious and nice . He actually has done work in comics as well , co-writing the series " The Last Christmas " with his friend Gerry Duggan , which tells the story of Santa Claus confronting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Posehn is writing for the Deadpool comics he admits that he identifies with the character , having grown up as an ostracized metal nerd who later turned his angst and unique interests into a writing and stand-up comedy career .

She 's gotten attacked both from inside and outside the geek community , constantly having to fight allegations that " She 's not a real nerd ! " Aisha is not only an incredible gamer , but also a writer and blogger and podcast host/guest who speaks extensively on behalf of geeks and gamers everywhere . Aisha has been known to speak out on behalf of geeks of all types especially girls , and black geeks .

Bill Gates and Steve Jobs - Yes , I 'm cheating and doing a duo . Bill Gates and Steve Jobs both helped show the entire country , and the world , that being a nerd is cool in the most American way possible - by making shitloads and shitloads of money . They both built products that are hardwired into our society and culture and people no longer seem to be able to live without . Their respective companies , Microsoft and Apple , have essentially changed our entire way of living and have helped move technology forward in leaps and bounds . Nobody can argue that being a nerd is cool in this case . Their products have helped an entire generation of people turn into tech geeks , swapping specs on their newest gadgets and phones . They are proof that nerds run the world now , and their success helps console downtrodden geeky high schoolers everywhere . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Thanks for making our society into a bunch of mindless , socially inept automatons , you jerks .

Vin Diesel Best known for his work in Fast and Furious and the Riddick series , Vin Diesel is seen as a posterboy for " jocks " everywhere . But lo and behold , he 's a not-so-secret geek himself . He admits that Dungeons and Dragons was the " training ground for his imagination " and was one of the things that helped get him interested in acting originally . He 's even written the forward to a Dungeons and Dragons book . And really , he 's exactly the kind of spokesperson we need in geekdom .

That 's what being a geek is all about , after all not being afraid to be passionate about something . <p> 10 . Donald Glover Known for his work as Troy on Community and also as a writer for the show 30 Rock ( with many geeky references and stars itself ) , Donald Glover is also a steadfast champion of geekdom . Like Aisha Tyler , he also grew up with the struggle of being one of the lone black geeks . Besides being an amazing comedy pair with Danny Pudi as Troy and Abed , he 's also personable and lovable , and exactly the kind of person we want playing for our team . Let 's not forget how amazing Community has been for geeks as well , with episodes featuring cast members as 8bit video game characters as well as one of the best homages to Dungeons and Dragons . <p> Six seasons and a movie ! <p> 9 .

Work includes The Guild , Supernatural , Eureka , Dragon Age : Redemption , and Dr. Horrible 's Sing Along Blog and she 's even done voices for video games like Fallout : New Vegas and podcasts and webseries that all focus on geekdom . How much more geek cred can you get ? She also talks about tabletop and gaming online extensively ( which of course is how she writes so much awesome nerd content for her shows ) .

Seth Green Seth Green has been one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies like Austin Powers and Ca n't Hardly Wait . He 's a geek in pretty much every sense of the word and has done a ton of work as an actor , writer , and producer that targets a nerdy audience .

He also makes appearances in other geeks work , like Weird Al 's White and Nerdy and his wife 's video " Geek and Gamer Girls " from Team Unicorn . I 've met Seth Green at several conventions over the years and he is the most patient , humble , and gracious celebrity you can ever hope to encounter .

I am going to guess most of you will say at least one . He 's been an amazing source for getting geeks the attention they deserve and has never shied away from discussing the hard issues . He 's an incredibly kind , genuine and wonderful man who has helped promote geekdom , as well as the LGBT community , in a constantly positive way . Ohhh myyyy . <p> 3 . Stan Lee How can anyone anywhere not love Stan Lee ? He is like everyone 's adoptive Grandpa . Besides being the arguably most influential comic book writer in history , creating and writing series like Hulk , The Fantastic Four , Iron Man , Spiderman , Thor , Daredevil , Avengers and X-Men since the 40 's , he continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He now helps run Comikaze , Los Angeles ' largest comic book convention , and makes several hilarious cameos in comic book movies based on his work ( Uatu the Watcher ? You decide ) . He also has his own charity , The S tan Lee Foundation , which was founded to focus on literacy , education and the arts by supporting programs that improve access to literacy resources , as well as promoting diversity , national literacy , culture and the arts . He 's also responsible for the single greatest image to ever come out of the internet . <p> 2 . Jamie and Adam of Mythbusters Jamie and Adam have pretty much the greatest job any geek can ask for . All those people who thought science was stupid when we were growing up ? Hard to argue with how incredibly badass science is when you get to see some of the things the Mythbusters use it for . Besides using science and experiments to tackle some of the greatest questions the have plagued mankind for years , let 's face it there are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's something even non-nerds can get behind .

He goes deep undercover in costume every year , dressing up as characters like Hellboy , a ringwraith , Admiral Ackbar , The Rocketeer and more so he can attend the convention as a fan . But seriously , every cosplay he has put together looks damn good , too . <p> Damn you , you stealthy science man . <p> 1 . Simon Pegg Most people will probably disagree with my choice to put Simon Pegg as my number 1 on this list . But I love Simon Pegg and everything he has done for us geeks .

@@34567273 @3567273/ <h> The Legend of Zelda : Skyward Sword Review <p> For those of you whove lost faith in the Wii due to the lack of exciting titles , and forlornly traded in your console at an extreme loss , I have important news for you . <p> You need to go get it back . <p> Forget Rock Band , Wii Fit , and all the other major Wii titles that quickly lost their appeal along with their novelty . The Legend of Zelda : Skyward Sword is a game whose charms will stand the test of time . <p> Though Twilight Princess was released on both Wii and GameCube , Skyward Sword is the only Zelda title that is exclusively playable on Wii . Released four years after the Wii , nearing the end of the consoles time , this game has the bittersweet honour of being almost inarguably its best title . <p> One small disclaimer before I proceed , in case it is not made evident by this article : when it comes to Zelda , the extent of my bias is extreme . Whereas in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am fanatical about the realm of Hyrule . All this aside , I will readily admit that the game is n't flawless . <p> Skyward Sword begins above the clouds in Skyloft , an idyllic island in the sky . The surface world is fabled , but not known to the people of this land , who travel between the various land masses on large birds called Loftwings . In true Zelda fashion , Links beloved Zelda is kidnapped , causing him to leave the comfort of his home and seek her on the surface . The main plot is a quest to rescue her . <p> Many criticize the Zelda franchise for the repetitive nature of its narrative . But perhaps having that familiarity is part of what makes the games so enthralling and immersive . Evoking nostalgia from that first play through Ocarina of Time , both game and hero are instantly endearing . But this early start does not inherently make the game a success . Skyward Sword does a great job of refreshing the story . Incorporating islands in the sky , where the only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by a bird , makes traversing the map more exhilarating . <p> Boss fights are more satisfying than ever , characters are memorable , and side quests are rewarding . The colour scheme of the texturing reminds me of Wind Waker . It is beautifully detailed and goes a long way to disguise the hardware limitations of the Wii . From afar , scenes take on an almost painterly quality . The musical score is fully orchestrated and honestly just plain amazing . I have Fis Theme stuck in my head right now . <p> This game makes use of the Wii Motion+ feature , which is an upgrade from the standard Wii controls in Twilight Princess . Still , though , its not perfect . It needs to be re-calibrated frequently . Its also so frustrating to see your blade slice through an enemy while doing no damage whatsoever ! I have rage quit a few times . Flying the bird , as novel as it is , can be infuriating . Aggravating enough to me is that this is not a winged Epona- The bird tends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will own that the Motion+ is not without its benefits . Many of the puzzles make use of this feature , allowing for new and more challenging puzzles . Executing the Skyward Strike , where you hold the blade skyward to power it up , is distinctly enjoyable . Despite all this , I still wish that the game had a classic control option built in . <p> I was pleasantly surprised to see that RPG-like elements were expanded upon in this installment of the franchise . Beyond the standard items , Link also has the Adventurers Pouch , which he can fill with non-essential items that aid the quest in various ways . Examples of these are shields , bottles and medals to augment heart or treasure drop rates . You can also collect materials and insects to upgrade your weapons , shield and potions . The efforts expended in amassing these items were not always worth the payout . I hope Nintendo makes this system more rewarding in future titles . <p> Hey , Listen . <p> Whether or not you 're a Zelda fan , you gamers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelf , dust it off and play this . This is the most immersive gaming experience I have had in a long time . All in all , Skyward Sword is a worthy contribution to the Zelda franchise , and a game worth investing your time and money in. 9/10.

Not only are they talented but they are hot , they are twins AND they are geek girls ! These film making twins are taking the film world by storm , recently making it into Cannes Film Festival debuting their latest masterpiece American Mary , which is featuring Ginger Snaps 's Katharine Isabelle ! In this interview I try to pick their twisted brains , enjoy an inside look on what beautifully morbid things stir in these gals heads ! <p> What inspired you to make films ? Were there any films or film makers that inspired or influenced your career ? <p> S : We kind of always had these weird interest and this odd skill set that did n't fit in anywhere , actually , it 's always been difficult for Jen and I to feel like we fit in . I liked film because it had this sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never set out to become a director or writer , we just kind of fell into it . We grew up admiring filmmakers like Rodriguez , Landis , Tarantino , Zemeckis , Barker , Craven , Raimi - and those unique , exciting , strange films really put a mark on us . EL MARIACHI - the film and the story behind it was what really gave us the inspiration on how to create our own film , we had the firsthand account novel - ' Rebel Without A Crew ' on hand at all time making DEAD HOOKER IN A TRUNK . But it was GRINDHOUSE - the multi-collaborative throwback love letter that gave us the vision to make the film . It all started as a faux trailer and a ' fuck you ' to the shitty film school that ripped us off and turned out to be the first step to creating the feature . <p> J : I 've loved films since I was a little girl . I actually do n't ever remember not loving them , particularly horror films . I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or producers . It 's usually more common to be told that you can grow up to be an actress or a model or a singer . So , we started off acting and got some pretty expected roles that you 'd find twins in . When we got older , the roles got even worse . Just stereotypical , overly sexualized , poorly written crap . I have no problem playing something sexy as we all know sex and violence sell , but we got pretty tired of chasing after roles we did n't even want just so we could be working . Our change into filmmaking came largely from that desire to take control of our careers . <p> A big part of that came from Rodriguez 's REBEL WITHOUT A CREW . It 's a must have for any and every filmmaker out there . Robert Rodriguez and his ten minute film schools and the way he makes films creatively with a modest budget inspired us to make DEAD HOOKER IN A TRUNK . There are so many filmmakers who influence me . Rodriguez , Tarantino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a great lover of Joss Whedon . His story lines are masterfully executed , his dialogue is completely original and sets trends , and his characters are unique , flawed , and timeless . One of his favorite quotes of mine on why he writes strong females is , " because you 're still asking me that . " <p> What is it like being a Twin ? Do you ladies have any special " twin powers " we should know of ? <p> S : Yes , totally ! I 'm so glad you asked that . So there is this weird version of the house we grew up in and this forest - neither of us have ever been there , but we both dream about it . In the morning , we 're all like - I dreamt of the forest last night . Holy shit , me too ! <p> I love being a twin . I would actually be utterly useless without her . It 's like we 're one whole in two different bodies . When we work together , we divide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having to talk , just through looks . It comes in very handy . I honestly have no idea what it is like to not be a twin , I imagine it 's very lonely and odd . I love have my sister there . We have a lifetime of in-jokes , it would be hard to get someone new caught up to speed . <p> J : It 's awesome . I love my twin . I was born with a best friend who never bullshits me , a sparring partner , an incredible co-creator , co-writer , and co-director . We 're very different , but we compliment and balance one another beautifully . People ask us if we 'd ever work apart and we easily could , but why would we want to ? We see things the same way , though we usually get there in very different ways . She 's a real artist . <p> Twin powers ? Yeah . We do . We can have a full conversation with a look . We can read each other so easily that we can very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even doing it . We do it right in front of people usually . If we 're apart and something 's wrong , we can feel it and have to call the other immediately . We 've dreamed of fictitious place separately , but it 's the exact same place . That 's kind of weird . <p> So how do you get yourself started in the film world ? Do you have any advice for anyone looking to create films of their own ? <p> S : A lot of people get their starts by making the most of the opportunities in front of them and rolling with the punches . We did n't set out to make a feature , we were pissed that a film school ripped us off and wasted our time . They had a list of everything considered ' too inappropriate ' for school projects , but because our faux trailer for DEAD HOOKER was our own project with no affiliation with the school , we decided to include everything on that list . Just to make sure , we added bestiality and necrophilia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already included in the list . <p> When we screened the film at graduation , the first time anyone had seen it , half the audience walked out and the other half was laughing and cheering so loud that you could barely make out the intentionally raunchy dialogue . After that , people started asking us when the feature was coming out , so we bullshitted and said we 're working on the feature length script right now . We went home and in two weeks had the script ready , started casting and crewing up , maxed out our credit cards and called in every favor we could to make it happen . When the film was done , we sent it to everyone , we promoted it when no one wanted it until it got a buzz , hit the festival circuit , and eventually got distribution . <p> You ca n't take no for an answer . You 're going to get a lot of people trying to discourage you and tell you that you need certain things to make a film . Right now , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level cameras are easily available , you have access to the world to market your project online , you can learn from your favorite filmmakers through DVD extras , interviews , even talk directly to them through twitter and Facebook , and there are phenomenal resources like ' Rebel Without A Crew ' and Lloyd Kaufman 's ' Make Your Own Damn Movie ' series . The hardest thing is to get started , but you can do it . Learn as much as you can , make a film that is marketable but also unique and means something to you - you 're most likely going to be with that film for years in the process , so make sure you pick something that you can stay passionate about . Like Dead Hookers . <p> J : We kind of fell ass backwards into filmmaking . At the time we wanted to make the shift from acting to stunt performing . We attended this god awful film school that somehow had this outstanding stunt program . When the program ended we were stuck and ended up having our funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school a middle fingered salute by doing the film anyways and incorporating their list of " inappropriate content " into the film . We even added a few extras that had n't made the list . That project ended up being a faux trailer for DEAD HOOKER IN A TRUNK and that was where it all started . <p> My best piece of advice is do n't give up . If you want to be a filmmaker , it 's going to be damn hard . No job has higher highs and lower lows . But there 's nothing more fulfilling . When you sit in a darkened theater about to watch your film for the first time with a full audience ? It beats a wedding day every single time . I 'd suggest , do n't start by writing a 20 million dollar epic . If you have it in you , write it . But I 'd recommend by coming up with an idea you 're really excited about because you will be talking about it for the rest of your life . For Robert Rodriguez , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns in EL MARIACHI . For us ? A dead hooker in a trunk . Make your own film . Do n't ever wait for someone to come along and make your career happen for you . Make it happen for yourself . Write a list of your resources . You 'll be amazed what you have available . A friend with a horse , a business that can be used after hours , a school , a cabin , a classic car , a weapons collective , a tarantula , anything . And then write around that . Be creative and overcome your obstacles in ways that do n't require throwing money around . It will get you more respect and it will teach you a lot more . Anyone can make a movie with money . Well , mostly , ha ha <p> So you , the " Twisted Twins " produce , write , direct , act and so forth in your own films , does it ever get overwhelming ? How do you ladies cope with the stress ? <p> S : The only thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time because with small independents , there is always a time issue - you never have enough of it , and you have to have faith that you 're shooting exactly what you what and how you want it . It 's part of the reason why we are stepping back from acting after our cameo in AMERICAN MARY . I want to have full control over the creative and the story telling - being behind the camera makes more sense . It never seems overwhelming because I want to be a part of everything . We tend to be a part of every department and have a good relationship with the team - you get to share ideas and create a stronger piece that way . I 've had the most amazing crew in the world . <p> I do get stressed a bit . I have Jen and she 's the most lovely human being . I very lucky to share my life with her . We laugh a lot about things . Even when everything is going to shit , we can find humour in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a control freak . Like Batman . I just have to be involved in every aspect . Making a film is like bringing a world to life and I want to be there for all of it . It can be a bit intense , but I have had the pleasure of working with some truly amazing people . And I have Sylvie . We never stop working . We 're very married to our careers . <p> The best way to deal with stress ? A killer sense of humor . If you ca n't laugh when everything goes to shit around you , stay out of the film business cuz let me tell you , it 's hilarious . <p> What do you think of the horror films being released in the recent years ? Any of them stand out to you ? What are some horror films you personally enjoy ? <p> S : I 'm actually really disappointed in the recent horror films that have been released , actually more accurately the studio/mainstream horror films being released . It 's a majority of unoriginal paint-by-numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of childhood fond horror memories . There is this really disturbing trend that the film being made does n't matter , whether the film is good does n't matter , only making money matters . There are ways of marketing , casting , hyping a pile of shit to guarantee a certain box office opening and once the public sees the film as the turd it is , it can die and fade away for the following weekends . Sadly , a lot of people in filmmaking could n't care less about films . <p> Not to say everything that has come out lately is an abomination , but the real gems do n't often get the attention that they deserve or the publicity to spread to a larger market . A lot of indie films are genius , but not enough people forgo the studio crap to see them or even know they exist . Some of my favourite recent(ish) horror films are I SAW THE DEVIL , THE SKIN I LIVE IN , ANTICHRIST , INSIDE , SLITHER , BEYOND THE BLACK RAINBOW , RUBBER , and HOBO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rad . <p> J : Some films are being made by the wrong people . Horror should be done by the people who LOVE horror . Not people who seem to think we horror fans are a collection of idiots who 'd be happy just to see some blood thrown around and the occasional tit with some lame " twist " at the end that a preschooler could have seen coming . And horror films seem to be oddly defined these days . I classify any film with horror in it as a horror , though it can fall into other genres , too . I SAW THE DEVIL was wonderful . I like how , unlike many North American films , foreign protagonists and antagonists are just black and white , but shades of grey which much closer reflect reality I find . I really enjoyed REC . The remake was pretty ick . LET THE RIGHT ONE IN was masterful . <p> Do you consider yourselves geeks ? If so , who do you think is the geekier of the two of you ? And what are your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We grew up on horror movies , comic books , and video games . We actually have all of our systems from our NES to XBOX 360 and everything in between , all consoles , still out to play . My Genesis adapter is fucked up , which really bums me out because I love those old side scrollers as much as the uber advanced new ones like Skyrim . I have over a thousand comic books , but I 've really fallen behind on my collecting since we stared with indie filmmaking racket , so I hope to start making a little money so I can catch up . Like , seriously , is Spider-man ok ? I have n't commitedly checked up on that dude in forever . <p> Also , pre-filmmaking days , I had high hopes of becoming an arachnologist . I talked to some of the leaders of the profession in the world and they ( kindly ) let me know that studying spiders is n't really a steady source of income , so I switched occupations . I still have my passion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant breeds . I wanted to discover a new species of spider and name it after myself , but I 'll settle for having the largest in captivity .

Like a ( geek ) boss . <p> I would say we are both die hard geeks , but the cool thing is that I think a lot of people in our generation are geeks . We 've grown up and now we 're seeing more geek culture become cool pop culture . Just please do n't fuck up my favourite video games and comic books with shitty movie adaptations please ! <p> J : Oh , we are UBER geeks ! It 's incredible to be alive in a time where geek is chic .

It 'll be epic . <p> I love comics and video games . I prefer Marvel . We started collecting when we were little , BEFORE we could even read . We 'd flip through the pages and picked the ones with girl heroes in them . We started with classic X-men , moved onto Spider-man , Daredevil ( I LOVE Daredevil ) , The Avengers , Ironman , and then pretty much the whole Marvel Universe . We have every system . We love Final Fantasy , Metal Gear Solid , Silent Hill , Skyrim , any good RPG or survival horror . We still play our SNES and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . The idea of someone that looks little and weak actually being so strong physically and on the inside had a lot to do with the woman I ended up being . I also attribute my love of martial arts to my desire to be a super hero when I grew up . I have n't totally abandoned that dream . I could out geek most . I 'll drop issue numbers and argue over writing continuity issues happily . I 'm a fairly well rounded geek , though I lament that I 've never really gotten into Star Wars . I also thought I 'd find the geek of my dreams and they 'd show me the magical world of Star Wars . <p> S : Eihi Shiina . She 's the anti-vicitm scream queen , actually I 'd be terrified to fuck with her .

She brings this unique and interesting quality to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in anything . <p> J : Sigourney Weaver 's Ellen Ripley . It 's a touch one because there are a lot of scream queens I adore . I love the ones that smashed the final girl stereotype like Buffy , but it really all started with Ripley . I remember watching her in ALIEN with my mom and I was so worried that the Alien was gon na get her and my mom told me , " it 's okay . Ripley 's strong and always wins . " In that moment I regarded her with child like awe and decided " I want to be her . " I hope that the work we do inspire little girls to look at us and feel the same way . <p> We are very excited about your upcoming feature " American Mary " which is premiering in Cannes Film Festival !

I think the biggest struggle we had is the same thing every independent film has to struggle with - modest funds and tight scheduling .

Everyone took a hit on what they would have gotten on a bigger production because they were working on the project because they felt passionately about it . <p> You can just tell when people are on your set for the right reasons . That was our set . We were these indie rebels , working with modest time and cash and creating something that looked like we had all the money and time in the world .

Also , we had the best cast on the planet - Katharine Isabelle ( Mary Mason ) , Antonio Cupo ( Billy Barker ) , Tristan Risk ( Beatress Johnson ) , Paula Lindberg ( Ruby RealGirl ) , David Lovgren ( Dr. Grant ) , Clay St. Thomas ( Dr. Walsh ) , Nelson Wong ( Dr. Black ) , Twan Holliday ( Lance Delgreggo ) , and John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked onto set , saw everyone hard work , watched the scenes play out was a triumph .

There were definitely some massive challenges on the project , but they were out shined by the victories . AMERICAN MARY was intended to be made much later in our careers . It 's a dream project . Though it follows Mary Mason through her medical profession struggles , the film tells of the struggles we 've been through in the film business . It 's a dark place filled with lions in lambs clothing . The people you think you can trust rarely are . I 've always felt like an outcast and I feel more at home with my fellow outcasts . We 've always taken joy in standing up for the underdog . There 's a lot of that that went into the making of the film . Struggle and sacrifice and survival . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a lot .

We 've loved Katharine Isabelle since we saw GINGER SNAPS and she could not have been a more perfect Mary . She 's really an amazing actress and this is a very challenging and mature role , by no means was it an easy one to play , but she did it like she was born to play the role .

Even as the show goes on , and we see more of the Equalists hidden secrets , Amon rarely appears in episodes and always hides behind his mask . <p> Since the series is set in a dark 1920s world , I find much of the series to allude to the Red Scare , as the Equalists have fought up until this point in the series with anonymity , with neighbors never knowing whom to trust , and the government crumbling under pressure . It is formatted like a mystery story with much of the plot devoted to deciphering who Equalists are and what they are doing . <p> The show does do a great job of balancing dark elements with fun quirks though . Tenzin , Korras airbending teacher , is supposed to be the most composed character we see and so the few moments of lost composure are hilarious , much of them involving his obnoxious 3 Airbending children . And who can forget about the love triangle between Korra , Mako @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korra and Asami coming ! <p> As to the episodes themselves , each of them squashes in as much information as possible , never getting the fine conclusion each episode needs .

To top it off you really need to know Avatar : The Last Airbender well in order to understand much of the Legend of Korra universe and to be able to formulate your own theories as to what will happen next . <p> The overall plot has unpredictable qualities ; characters are not who they first appear and , like The Last Airbender , destinies of main characters change . The characters who get the least screen time have become favorites for Tumblr users .

Its all been Korra running away from Amon or defending herself from Amon , and rightfully so . Korra still has not used the Avatar State in combat . The only time we see it is when Aang comes by at the end to pretty much save the day and give Korra , not only her bending back , but to bestow the ability to energy bend onto her . <p> With this shocking season finale , Legend of Korra now has the potentcial to surpass The Last Airbender . The artistry and animation easily surpasses that of The Last Airbender . What I will be curious to see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death of Amon . The creators of Legend of Korra will be hard pressed to create another strong antagonist , and one which will trigger new features to the world of the Avatar and open our minds to the infinite possibilities .

I 'm the executive producer of the The League of S.T.E.A.M . I 'm an actor and independent film producer . <p> Duane Matthews : I play the character Jasper Mooney - expert tracker , sharp shooter and werewolf hunter . I 'm a college art professor of 30+ years and I do pirate re-enactments on tall mast ships . <p> Q : For anyone who is not familiar with your work , give us a little bit of a rundown about your group and what you do . <p> Trip : The League of S.T.E.A.M . is a group of artists , performers , and inventors who take our audience back to a time of intrepid adventures , bridging the gap between the supernatural and the scientific ; we are monster hunters from the Victorian era . We 're best known for our award-winning steampunk web series The Adventures of the League of S.T.E.A.M. , which chronicles our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in interactive entertainment , performing with a fusion of fantastic technology , interactive demonstrations , and theatrical trickery , and our live events showcase a mesmerizing array of fully functional gadgets and props meticulously designed to enchant and entertain audiences of all ages . Our mission is to create unforgettable entertainment , telling stories through a unique mix of interactive live shows , a popular web series , steampunk podcasts , and interactive fan club . We 've performed live shows at conventions , such as Wild Wild West Con , Steam Con , Dragon Con , Vid Con , Nova Albion and for special events at E3 and Walt Disney Imagineering . We 've also done steampunk music videos and co-productions with Panic ! At The Disco , Justin Bieber , and Epic Meal Time . <p> Duane : The League of S.T.E.A.M . is a group of ten performers that have created a world in which we seek to manage monsters and things that go bump in the night ( of course these adventures take place in Victorian times ) . We are also a production company capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic endeavors . The League of S.T.E.A.M . brings it 's world to various audiences with live stage shows , Victorian themed parlor shows , a tent show and our web series . We also attend many conventions and festivals , and we recently participated in helping to host the IAWTV Awards and The Geekie Awards show . <p> Q : You guys have been around since 2008 . Since then , we 've seen a huge increase in Steampunk fandom and it 's a lot more " mainstream " than when you started ( Steampunk costumes at Halloween stores , etc ) . How do you feel this has affected your group and Steampunk as a whole ? Do you like that there is a bigger audience for it now , or do you feel like it 's lost some of it 's original charm ? <p> Trip : Our group was into steampunk before the big explosion and we 've been along for the ride as TV shows , music videos , conventions and fashion have delved into steampunk culture . Overall , I feel most of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new audiences to steampunk and that more people have become involved in the community . However , in some cases , there 's been a silly ' jumping on the band wagon ' where online merchants are willing to tag all their items as ' steampunk ' when it has absolutely nothing to do with the genre what-so-ever . I think the charm is still there , for those who are genuine &amp; creative - one of the coolest things about steampunk is the DIY factor and the detailed craftsmanship of quality steampunk artisans . I will say the Halloween store costumes typically have very low quality and very little craft so that 's not so great . BUT if it inspires someone to say ' what 's this ? ' and to get excited and begin exploring steampunk , I think that 's wonderful ! <p> Duane : For the most part , the League is encouraged with the growth ( mainstreaming ) of Steampunk . Yes , there can be a " watering down " of sorts , but the real under pinnings of the culture are strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever growing audience . We have fun with presenting our world and we want to share it with others - the more , the merrier . <p> Q : Where did you originally come up with the concept for your group and your stage shows ? It combines so many aspects of things that I love , from circus , to Steampunk , to zombies , costumes , music and gadgets - what goes into the planning of putting on such a spectacle ? <p> Duane : The concept of our group came about right around 2008 . Nick Baumann , Robin Blackburn , James Lavrakas and friends , cooked up an idea for Victorian ghosts busters . The women made fantastic glowing ghost costumes and the men designed and built the equipment to locate and eradicate said spooks . These actions took place at the Labyrinth of Jareth , one of the biggest costume events in Hollywood . In very short order other members were included to the group in order to hunt and subdue other creatures . We first started shooting the our monster hunting videos to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing our stage shows . Our stage shows serve to entice viewers into our world . These shows were developed for cons and festivals that we were being asked to attend . A lot of work goes into our live shows and it begins with where it will be seen - Will we need a new creature ? Is there a need to build new gadgets ? Then we write the show and of course , rehearse , rehearse , rehearse . <p> Q : All of you clearly have strong creative backgrounds besides the League of S.T.E.A.M . What are your day jobs , and how did you all get so talented ? How did you all meet and become a group together ? <p> Duane : Yes , we do have an eclectic group of people who make up our team . Without going into the specifics of each of the member of The League , these are the day jobs we have - We have three educators , teaching all levels of school in the fields of science , theater and art , professional prop makers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ film makers , designers and illustrators , post production TV editors , costumers and leather workers - these are but some of day jobs we have . I would say that our talents come about from a dollop of luck and loads of hard work . We ( as a group ) came together through many of us being friends first . Most of us belonged to some other acting/costuming group and developed our relationships there . Pirates can be blamed for many of us knowing one another . <p> Q : Tell us a little bit about your gadgets . The design , the concept , how you build them , how you come up with them . <p> Trip : Our team includes talented costumers , fabricators and artists . Nick Baumann , who plays Crackitus Potts , designs and fabricates many of our most impressive props , such as our net gun , plunger gun , ghost pack , kraken tentacle , monsters , etc . Nick has an amazing background in foam fabrication and has worked in Jim Henson 's workshop and on major movies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's created many signature pieces , like his jump pack and hand-cranked chainsaw . Conrad Wright Jr . is an expert leatherworker , Duane Matthews is a talented sculptor , Glenn Freund is a great builder , Robin Blackburn is a talented costume designer , Russell Isler is a VFX artist , Kate Walsh is a great production designer , and Sheyne Fleischer is a great costumer - we all contribute our own costuming skills . We create all our props and costumes ourselves in our own private home-based workshops . <p> Duane : The most important thing about our gadgets is that they actually function . We try to give our gadgets a uniform look that fits the aesthetic of the League ( a quasi Rube-Goldberg ) - large and humorous . Nick built and designed much of the equipment in the early days of The League . The design and building of new gadgets have become more a team effort , but Nick still has input and approval of what is being attempted . The concept of the gadgets are often related to how they will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they help define a character . Most of our stuff comes out of the garage , be it Nick or Andrew 's . Sometimes our living room becomes the inventor 's lab . <p> Q : How did you get involved with Panic ! At the Disco and what was it like being in their music video ? <p> Trip : When the Grammy-nominated band Panic ! at the Disco wanted to feature steampunk as a main element in the music video premiere of their highly-anticipated single , " The Ballad of Mona Lisa " , they contacted The League of S.T.E.A.M . for input on realizing their vision . We provided props , gadgets , costumes , advice and made up almost all of the background performers in the video . Produced by Brandon Bonfiglio and directed by Shane Drake , the video features a spectacular Steampunk style , much of which was influenced and created by your very own League of S.T.E.A.M ! It was a pleasure to work with Brendon and Spencer . <p> Duane : We became involved with Panic ! at the Disco 's video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the video . It was great fun working on this video and both Brendon and Spencer were down to earth guys and easy to work with . The director , Shane Drake , knew what he was doing and made it easy to follow his concept . It was a lot of fun . <p> Q : Tell us about your awesome web series . It 's now into it 's 3rd season and has been successfully funded through Kickstarter to bring even bigger and better things . What has it been like getting that kind of support from the community , and where do you see the show going in the future ? <p> Trip : The web series is about steampunk ghost-busters and monster-hunters on crazy adventures to either eliminate monster threats or investigate supernatural phenomenon . Think Jules Verne meets Wild Wild West meets Scooby-Doo . It 's a comedy adventure filled with colorful characters , fantastical functional steampunk gadgets , impressive costuming and lots of practical monster effects . Our first season was mostly a monster of the week storyline . In the second season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusually high number of monster encounters . We were blown away by the support of friends and fans contributing to our season three Kickstarter campaign ! We raised over $30,000 , which will fund at least nine new episodes . We 've announced we 'll be doing an adventure with a giant rock monster and a musical episode . This season will include more fantastical steampunk monster hunting gadgets , more monsters &amp; bigger monsters , new guest stars , more appearances by friends , fans , and notables within the steampunk community , cool new locations and higher production quality . <p> Duane : The web series started out as a seat-of-the-pants operation . The first season was shot on a shoe-string budget ( what we had in our pockets ) and it was a bit of rough and tumble ( not tons of pre-production work ) , but it taught us a lot . Our season two was far more structured and professional - we had generated some money and spent more time in all aspects of making the series . The support we got for season two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming . We are determined to make the very best series that we can . We are currently writing and developing the series and it looks great . The future is hard to foresee , but if a season four is out there , then our fans could expect further development of the League characters , more creatures , and of course more guest stars . <p> Q : What has been your most memorable experience working with the League ? <p> Trip : Since we 've done so many shows , episodes , and conventions , a lot blends together and we 've really had some wonderful times with friends , fans and fellow artists . For me , my most memorable moments have been when we 're all deeply involved in a project and everyone is working as a team such as rehearsing and performing our live show for Wild Wild West Con or shooting an all-hands-on-deck web series episode like Dead End . Also , we 're very lucky not only to be a creative team , but we share a long lasting friendship . I cherish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a round of shared drinks and words of thanks in something we call ' tradition ' . <p> Duane : For me , one of the most memorable experiences was being on stage at the IAWTV Awards show . Four members of the League ( Trip , Glenn , Andrew and myself ) were there to help with presentations and The League was nominated in a number of categories as well . The group won two awards , for Best Costuming and Best Makeup &amp; Special Effects . All of us being up on stage to receive those awards was amazing . I imaged to some degree , what it would be like to win an Oscar , for at that moment , I could n't imagine it being any better . <p> Q : What conventions and events can we see you at in the future ? <p> Trip : We 're always at San Diego Comic Con ! Depending on our schedule , you 'll most likely see us at Dragon Con , Stan Lee 's Comikaze , Steam Con , Wild Wild West Con , Calico Ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albion . We will continue to do live shows , but the best way to see us this year is online in the third season of our web series .

Friends of ours started talking about going and dressing up and of course , the cosplayer in me decided I wanted to go . So my hubby and I caught ourselves up with season 4 to prep for the finale . <p> We showed up at the theatre , me in my Margaery Tyrell inspired look and Retro Joad in his Warlock based on the book . We bought our popcorn and drinks and met up with our group , another Margaery , Ellaria Sand and Daenerys . We were not disappointed . <p> It was electric sitting in that sold out theatre with everyone . We were all in it together and we rode it to the end . It was so amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the seventeen and eighteen year olds to the very nice older ladies in their sixties sitting behind us , who struck up a conversation with my husband about his costume . We clapped when the opening credits played and then dove right in . We all remembered the tragic death of Ygritte , replayed again for us , and it was only a matter of time before the bodies started falling in this episode . <p> Let 's start with Jon and the Wall . We are left with the repercussions of the last episode . We see the vast amount of dead bodies of the Black Brothers and Wildlings alike . Jon leaves through the tunnel to find Mance Rayder to kill him , or try to and ends up face to face with Stannis Baratheon and his enormous army . Of course , Stannis is all " kneel to me " and Mance is " We do not kneel " and Jon convinces the Burning Heart/Stag that he should show some mercy and hear what Mance has to say . This was a great scene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Keeping North , Bran , Hodor and the Reeds make it to the Tree , or the Blu Ray loading screen as my hubby jokingly told me . They make it but not before some freaky magic starts happening , skeletons breaking through the icy ground to start attacking this little band . The effects used here were pretty cool , I really liked how they moved and how they fought . Looking forward to seeing more magic happening in seasons to come . It 's here that poor Jojen meets his end by one of those bony jerks and the rest almost come to the same fate , if it were n't for Bran taking over Hodor to fight them and Leaf , one of the First Children coming to lead them to safety . We keenly feel Meera 's sadness at leaving her brother and she makes the decision to keep going . Here we meet the three eyed raven in human form . Dragons are in the world again and magic is growing stronger . And Bran will fly according to the Raven . For those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait and see . <p> Making the trek across the Narrow Sea , Daenerys is having great troubles . People coming in and asking her permission for various things , and then we get a grieving man . This actor was so fantastic . I truly felt pain at him coming in and holding his child that was burnt to a crisp by Drogon . " Why ? " he asks of her and she has no answer . Darren Kent ( Grieving Father ) had such a short scene , but with a whole lot of impact . What can she do but lock up her babies ? Viserion and Rhaegal follow her blindly into the dark catacomb , trusting her while she chains them up . " But MOOOOMMMMM , we did n't do anything ! " These dragons are not real and yet I felt their cries like they were . Drogon is nowhere to be found doing what it is that dragons do and Daenerys is heartbroken . <p> I feel it important to mention that at one point during the episode , it cut out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in that theatre . <p> Arya and the Hound meet up with Brienne and Pod , who I absolutely adore . That actor is hilarious . So this fight ( which did not happen in the book ) proved to be arguably the most evenly matched fight of the entire series . Gwendoline Christie ( Brienne ) is brilliant as this character and the fight with the Hound was epic . Sword play and rock smashing along with a host of other hits that made the audience collectively groan , this was worth my 10 bucks . Arya leaves the Hound mortally wounded , does not give him mercy , though he pleads for her to kill him , she does n't and steals his coins . Our last view of Arya is her coming to a port trying to gain passage on a boat . The captain has no interest in her , saying he 's sailing to Bravos and when she says Valar Morghulis and offers him an iron coin , his attitude does a complete turnaround . She gets passage and a cabin and we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we come to the Lannisters . I saved this for last as I believe this was the most satisfying part of the episode . This part is twofold . Cersei has a heated discussion with her father stating that she wo n't marry Loras Tyrell . Tywin , being Tywin does not agree . This whole encounter ends with Cersei admitting the truth to her father , who is actually blind to what his children were doing , about the truth of his precious house and name . Cersei may not be liked but I certainly loved the look of milk curdling on Tywin 's face . Next , we see Tyrion in his cell waiting for his end when he hears someone at the door . Not the executioner , but his brother to help him escape . Whatever Jaime has done , I truly believe he loves his brother . Tyrion is steps away from escaping when he thinks better of it . He walks back upstairs into the castle with a determined air . He comes to Tywin 's room with a crossbow to make his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . But not just any woman , it 's Shae calling Tywin her Lion , twisting the knife even further . It 's clear that Tyrion had no idea about her but now Shae 's testimony at his trial is understood . At that moment in the theatre , it was dead quiet but for one audience member who called her a b*&amp;%@ , and the whole audience had a little chuckle and I definitely agreed . She fooled me too . Sadly , for Tyrion , he ends her life by choking her with her chain . This scene ended with a beautiful shot of Tyrion 's face and Shae 's lifeless one , really framing Tyrion 's sadness . But he is n't done . He went in search of his father with his crossbow in hand . And what a way to find the great Tywin Lannister but on the privy . Tywin is convinced that Tyrion wo n't shoot him , " You 're my son " he says , that he never would have let him go to his death . Tyrion does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of his children and shoots his father with two bolts all while he has his pants down on the loo . Fitting end for this man , and the cheer for this was louder than any other . We see Tyrion leave secreted in a box with Lord Varys also across the Narrow Sea . So very fitting to watch this episode on Father 's Day , Happy Father 's Day Tywin , I 'm sure it definitely was n't how you were expecting things to go . <p> The episode was a strong one and highly entertaining . Watching it on the big screen gave it so much to add to the entertainment of the show . It was better than a movie as everyone there loves the show and was n't there to tear it apart . I certainly hope they do this again , perhaps even for the opening of season 5 as well as the finale . I will definitely be buying tickets .

I know there 's tons more so leave a comment with your favs ! ) <p> Sarah ( Labyrinth ) : She 's an obvious choice for me since I spent many childhood years watching my Labyrinth VHS tape over &amp; over again wishing I was her and singing along with Bowie . This movie is a modern classic and Sarah is a great heroine . She 's just your average young girl , a little snarky which I can relate to hehe , but in the end she of course saves the day . " You have no power over me . " <p> Red Sonja ( Dynamite Entertainment ) : She has it all , strength , power , beauty , sex appeal , fearlessness , you name it she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs ! For me she 's the quintessential bikini armor-clad warrior woman . I love her comic books and also the Red Sonja movie starring Brigitte Nielsen . I had been looking forward to Rose McGowan playing her in a remake movie a few years back but due to an injury and other reasons that never happened . Hopefully someday soon we 'll get another Red Sonja movie because this would have been cool ... <p> Tauriel ( The Hobbit ) : I know , I KNOW , she 's not in the books . Please stop nerd raging . Tauriel is still awesome and I for one am very glad they added her in The Hobbit trilogy because let 's face it , Tolkien was n't exactly generous with writing female characters ( only 19% of the characters mentioned in all his Middle-earth works are female ) . She 's strong willed and clearly an expert archer . I think Evangeline Lilly did a great job bringing this new character to life and I 'm interested to see what happens in her storyline . <p> Lady Sif ( Marvel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born a goddess and forged a warrior . " Who does n't love Lady Sif ? Well apparently Thor in the Marvel movie universe does n't , lol . Every Thor movie I ca n't help but scream " Dammit Thor she 's so much better than Jane Foster ! What is wrong with you ? " So I 'm hoping they eventually scrap Thor &amp; Jane 's relationship and hook him up with Sif because they make a pretty unstoppable team . OR just give Sif her own movie because she 's badass and we all love her ! And let 's not forget comic book Sif ... <p> Hermione Granger ( Harry Potter ) : She 's intelligent , quick witted , logical , dedicated ... I could go on , she 's basically a magical genius despite being Muggle-born . Although she may be bossy she is completely loyal and will always be there for her friends . She 's definitely someone you want on your side ! <p> +owyn ( Lord of the Rings ) : She is a noblewoman of Rohan who longs to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battle of the Pelennor Fields against the evil Witch-king of Angmar , Lord of the Nazgvl who proclaims " No living man may hinder me ...

For living or dark undead , I will smite you , if you touch him . " and then she kills him with her sword ! To sum it up ... <p> Wonder Woman ( DC Comics ) : Wonder Woman is a true comic book superheroine and icon . Her depiction as a heroine fighting for justice , love , peace , and sexual equality has led to her being widely considered a feminist icon . To me she shows women can be strong , compassionate , beautiful and be both princesses &amp; warriors . We can be it all ! Her character has been through many different transformations , but these traits remain the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Princess Diana of Themyscira . <p> Daenerys Targaryen ( Game of Thrones ) : She 's hands down my favourite character in Game of Thrones . Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen , of the blood of Old Valyeria , Mother of Dragons has inspired millions of women to find their inner Khaleesi . In fact in 2012 over 100 Americans named their baby girls Khaleesi . She 's also hugely popular with cosplayers , I love seeing all the different Daenerys cosplays at cons and online . She 's also got some of the best quotes , " I will take what is mine with fire and blood . " , " All men must die , but we are not men . " and of course " Drakaris ! " <p> Buffy Summers ( Buffy the Vampire Slayer ) : Joss Whedon sure knows how to write women !

I wanted Buffy to be a cultural phenomenon , period . " Mission accomplished . I knew when I started this list that Buffy &amp; Xena would take the top spots ... <p> Xena ( Xena : Warrior Princess ) : Xena was another childhood idol of mine . I remember playing Xena : Warrior Princess in our backyards when we were n't inside watching the show . I love to watch her quest for redemption from her dark past unfold and her loving " friendship " with Gabrielle grow , which has lead her to become a lesbian icon . Xena is incredible at hand-to-hand combat as we see with her ability to take out hoards of attackers single-handedly . She is also highly skilled in the use of pressure points and of course her signature weapon the chakram . Simply , Xena rocks , she 's a pop cultural phenomenon , another feminist icon and just a general badass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arya Stark ( I did n't what to overwhelm the list with GoT ladies as there are so many great female characters ) , She-Ra , Alice , Dejah Thoris , Lagertha Lothbrok ( since Vikings is somewhat historically accurate and she is based on a real person I was n't sure if she could count as " fantasy " but I love her ) Codex ( from The Guild , since it is a comedy I was n't sure if I could count her either , but she rocks ) and if we 're including Disney Merida &amp; Mulan . <p> Also as a side note , I did n't include any video game ladies in either my Sci-Fi or Fantasy lists , so that will have to be another list altogether ! : ) <p> I know there 's tons more epic ladies of fantasy so leave a comment with your favs !

@@34567445 @3567445/ <h> Top 13 Favourite Movies of 2013 <p> Here 's my *SPOILER FREE* list of my top 13 favourite movies of 2013 ! I am by no means a movie critic , nor do I claim to be , this is just a personal list . Please leave your recommendations for me in the comments , I 'd love to hear what you guys would add to your lists and I 'd love more cool movies to watch ! : D ( Also I cheated I have n't seen Anchorman 2 or Gravity yet , DOH ! ) <p> 13 . Anchorman 2 : The Legend Continues : CONFESSION : I have not had a chance to see this movie yet , but I am too big of an Anchorman fan to exclude it . So I ca n't properly rank it as of yet . I am almost certain it would make my list though based on my love for Will Ferrell and the first movie . I do n't know how to put this but , it 's kind of a big deal ... <p> 12 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie either , but it felt like an injustice to leave it out . I 've heard such great things about it and it 's at the top of many other best of 2013 lists . The trailer looked awesome to me , even though I 'm neither a Bullock nor Clooney fan . I actually never saw it in the theatre since my boyfriend despises Sandra Bullock as an actress so much he refused to go , lol . So again , this movie is not fairly ranked , but I assure you I have seen all the following movies on this list ... <p> 11 . The Wolverine : I thought this was so much better than the Origins : Wolverine movie . Hugh Jackson makes a perfect Wolverine , his acting was solid . I also really liked Rila Fukushima as Yukio . Overall it was a good movie , I did n't find it as fun as some of the other Marvel movies which I generally prefer , but still very entertaining . <p> 10 . Thor : The Dark World : This movie was entertaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as the first Thor movie , but overall it was fun . Tom Hiddleston as Loki was of course my favourite part ( said every fangirl ever , lol ) . And my favourite movie poster was this fan-made poster which a Chinese movie theatre used by accident ... classic ... <p> 9 . Man of Steel : So I 'm not really a big Superman fan personally ( queue then near rage , hehe ) so I was pleasantly surprised with this movie . As a sci-fi fan I really liked the way Krypton looked at the beginning , especially in 3D . The Matrix babies may have taken it a bit far , but oh well . I think Henry Cavill makes a great Supes , Amy Adams pulled off Lois Lane and Michael Shannon and Antje Traue were awesome as the bad guys . It bothered me a little that he did n't even try to draw the fighting away from Smallville or Metropolis to reduce damage and casualties and even managed to wreck a satellite , lol , but he makes up for it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 8 . The World 's End : I was a little worried when I went to watch this movie that it would n't be able to stand up to This Is the End , the other apocalypse comedy blockbuster of the year , but I think it did . I knew it would be good since it was written and starred in by Simon Pegg , a geek hero of mine . I really , really liked the ending ( which I wo n't spoil for anyone ) , I did n't see it coming at all . And I may be wrong , but it seemed a little bit inspired by Douglas Adams ' ( another geek hero of mine ) work when he was talking to the aliens in the pub . Definitely a fun , funny movie with an interesting moral message . <p> 7 . Sharknado : Sharks . Tornado . Sharknado . ' Nuff said . <p> ... except I 'm actually going to say more . Obviously this movie was epically terrible . But it was so terrible that it became genius . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a soft spot for low-budget , painfully bad movies which is why I love movies made by The Asylum ( yes I even watched Atlantic Rim ) . I 'll just say it , I laughed my ass off during this movie . It may have been the beer , but my face literally hurt from laughing . I loved it . I have no complaints at all , the inconsistencies and horrible acting/dialogue only added to my delight . I almost wanted to put it higher on the list , but I 'm not sure legitimately liking something and liking something sarcastically are the same thing . So I 'll just leave you with this ... <p> 6 . Star Trek Into Darkness : I 'm a lifelong Trekker , I 've been watching Star Trek since I was a little girl and I 've seen every episode of every series and every movie multiple times . Basically I love all things Trek . Now we all know the new Trek is n't exactly what Rodenberry envisioned ( putting it lightly ) , but times change and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abrams toned down the lens flare in this one ( huzzah ! ) and it 's was a fun action movie in space . With Zachary Quinto as Spock , Simon Pegg as Scotty and Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan you ca n't really go wrong . <p> 5 . Elysium : I 've been a huge fan of Neill Blomkamp &amp; Sharlto Copley ever since District 9 so I was really looking forward to this movie . It had a few flaws but did not disappoint . I love the world Blomkamp created in Elysium and I feel like it 's eerily close to where we are headed if we do n't drastically change our ways and start addressing economic disparity in our societies . My main complaint with the movie ( although it did n't stop me from liking the movie overall ) is the ending , it felt way too ' happy ' for my liking . I ca n't really go into it any further without spoilers . I was pleasantly surprised with Matt Damon 's performance since I 'm not generally a fan of his , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is this ( hehe ) ... <p> 4 . Iron Man 3 : This movie was fun and funny , which is really all I ever really want from an Iron Man movie . It was no Iron Man , but I did like it better than Iron Man 2 . There were certainly some problems , his panic attacks seemed unnecessary and out of character and I did n't like the ' fireworks ' at the end at all . He better get back to work building suits asap ! But besides all that I loved it . I liked his little kid sidekick and their interactions and Pepper Potts rocked ! I know comic purists hated it , but I thought what they did with the Mandarin was hilarious and a smart misdirection . Also one of my fav funny scenes of the year is when Tony talks to one of his biggest fans in the van , here 's more in the outtakes ... <p> 3 . This Is the End : This movie was epically hilarious . The theatre I was in was howling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like vulgar humour it 's not for you , it was definitely an R rated movie . These are some of my fav comedic actors and they were all super funny . It 's no surprise that I loved this movie , I 've been patently awaiting it 's existence ever since 2007 with the release of the short film trailer for Jay and Seth vs . The Apocalypse , which inspired the full length movie ... <p> 2 . The Hobbit : The Desolation of Smaug : I loved the The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey and I loved this movie just as much . Martin Freeman is absolutely perfect as Bilbo . Actually all the casting choices were perfect in my eyes . And I have to say I have absolutely no problem with the addition of Tauriel ( yes purists , we all know she 's not in the book you can stop whining about it now ) , in fact I loved her character and am thankful she was added . Frankly Tolkien 's work is severely lacking in the female department so I completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunning , as all Peter Jackson 's LoTR movies are . The 3D was great , not overdone it just enhanced it nicely . And finally we get to Smaug , perhaps the best casting of all , Benedict Cumbersmaug ... <p> And my favourite cameo , did you spot Stephen Colbert as a hooded spy in Laketown ? Well here he is ... <p> 1 . Pacific Rim : Giant mechs vs giant monsters , FTW ! This movie rocked , it was such a fun summer blockbuster . Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi both killed it as Raleigh and Mako . The movie did n't waste any time and just got right into the good stuff . I loved watching the Jaegers fight the Kaiju and it was great to see humanity working together to fight their enemy . To be honest I did n't think I would like Pacific Rim as much as I did , I thought it would just be another cliche action movie , but damn it 's just SO AWESOME ! I can only hope Godzilla will be as epic . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the movie , the best inspirational speech from a leader since the president in Independence Day ... " Today there is not a man nor woman in here that shall stand alone . Not today . Today we face the monsters that are at our door and bring the fight to them .

Oh and I few more I have n't got a chance to see yet but want to : Now You See Me , The Hunger Games : Catching Fire &amp; Frozen . <p> I hope you all enjoyed my list !

I wanted to shoot for her . I could n't let this one go to waste .

I would have been lost without her-I would have been lost in this world of costume photos without her . The Charming Violet and Mandy both put in SO much work , together all of the elements captured the character ... the only thing left for me to do was to try and capture some of her expressions .

@@34567478 @3567478/ <h> Interview with Nathan Rice - Director of The Gamers <p> Geek Girl Zelda recently did an interview with Nathan Rice , director of The Gamers - D&amp;D movie trilogy . The third movie is now in production after they ran an epic Kickstarter campaign ... <p> Q : So , for those readers who might not be aware , who are the Dead Gentlemen/Zombie Orpheus Entertainment and what do you do ? Dead Gentlemen and Zombie Orpheus Entertainment are a group of film-makers who create and provide an accessible net-space for projects that kick ass . Both founded by the same group of folks , Dead Gentlemen(DG) and Zombie Orpheus(ZOE) are behind movies like The Gamers : Dorkness Rising , and the web-series JourneyQuest . Online , ZOE is also a place for other movie and web-series makers to showcase what they 've made side-by-side with our own projects . We figure there 's got ta be other stuff out there that 's awesome , and by putting it all in one spot , we can make a Voltron of entertainment . You can come to the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find even more stuff that 's bad-ass . Audience-sourcing , I think one of the smart people called it . <p> The big news with you guys right now is that your 3rd installment of the Gamers series was not only funded on Kickstarter recently - It was the highest funded film of all time on the site ( Congratulations ) . How does it feel to have such support from your fans ? It feels pretty damned good . We 're not big Hollywood . We 're not even small Hollywood . We operate entirely on the support of our fans . If we did n't have such an unbelievably , astonishingly , mind-blowingly crazy-cool group of fans who support our efforts , we would never have done a single project after the original The Gamers , and we would never have broken the Kickstarter record when we did , and we would n't be attempting right now to put in place a new system of distribution that takes full advantage of this series of tubes that my small typewriter is hooked up to , allowing us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreseeable future . <p> What can you tell us about the third movie ? Will it pick up right where we left off in Dorkness Rising ? Follow the same cast of characters ? It will pick up with the same cast of real-world characters , Cass , Joanna , etc. but not immediately after . Some time has passed since we filmed our first movie ( say , eight f@#$ing years ) and there 's no reason not to acknowledge that . Our players are older , wiser , and ... okay , they 're just older . This time , though , while we will still see our fantasy D&amp;D characters , Luster , Flynn , etc. the movie looks at Cass 's involvement in the world of Collectible Card Games . But we still use the same basic mechanic , going between the real and fantasy world . How do we do that with a card game ? You 'll see when we release the movie . We 're partnered with Alderac Entertainment Group(AEG) , the makers of Legend of the Five Rings , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out about that a little each day . <p> What was it like shooting footage at Gen Con ? Any funny stories come out of that experience ? Well , I 've been to GenCon quite a few times with the DG crew to promote our shows , but this was the first time we filmed anything substantial there . It was also one of the highlights of my life as a film-maker . We held an event at GenCon in which we did a Gamers Improv for the first half , and then filmed a scene from the movie for the second half . We had 500+ people in the audience , and the energy from that crowd was absolutely electric . All fans , all very excited to be helping contribute their time and efforts to the project . I 'm not kidding when I talk about how great our fans are . My goosebumps had goosebumps . <p> So , what edition of Dungeons and Dragons do you guys play ? Got any opinions on the new 5th edition that is coming out soon ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few Pathfinder games as well . I 'm usually happy to try whatever gaming system is out , as long as I get to game . I 've looked over D&amp;D Next , but have n't tried it yet . I 'm interested to see the results . I also have a new Pathfinder game I might get in on that I 'm pretty stoked about . <p> Can we plan to see more Journey Quest from you as well ? How does working on a film compare to working on a webseries ? You can expect that a Kickstarter from JourneyQuest will be emerging in the future , although I could n't begin to accurately estimate when . As for film versus web-series , when DG/ZOE does it the differences are small . JourneyQuest is filmed identically to a longer narrative . The episode breaks are built into the script , so it does n't change the way it is shot . That means that as an actor , the main differences are in the role . For The Gamers , I do n't have to get prosthetics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much the whole thing ... at one point we discussed the best way to apply my " taint paint . " ' Nuff said . ) <p> Will The Gamers be at any conventions coming up ? Why , how convenient that you ask . November 9-11 is ZOECon , our very own Con here in Seattle . The attendance is limited in number , but it will be fun gaming , and a chance to be in the film ! Details can be found at zoecon.net <p> Finally , what 's next for you guys ? What can we hope to see from you in the future ? That 's a question I wish I knew the answer to . Once Gamers 3 is finished , you can expect that we will be gearing up for season 3 of JourneyQuest , assuming our unreasonably cool fans decide they like us enough to keep us going . After that ... well , we 've really only just begun to explore what can be done with crowd-sourcing . Our biggest enemy to future projects being completed is obscurity . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hollywood studio could produce , so we rely on word-of-mouth , on fans telling other fans , telling potential fans , telling their grandmothers , etc . <p> On a final note , in case I have n't gushed enough , a big hearty thank you to all of the fans who have pledged to our Kickstarters , or given time to help our project , or recruited other fans . All of us in DG/ZOE would just be some unknown schlubs without your time , money , and support . I hope we can keep making stuff that you want to see , ' cause damn do we love making it !

@@34567509 @3567509/ <h> In Defense of The Rocky Horror Picture Show Remake <p> The Rocky Horror Picture Show is getting a made-for-TV reboot produced by Fox this October , and a lot of people are n't  happy about it . I am here to tell you why I personally think those people are wrong . <p> First , let me quantify this article by saying that Rocky Horror Picture Show was an extremely important part of my coming of age . From ages 15-20 , I religiously attended the San Diego midnight shadowcast Crazed Imaginations almost every Friday and was part of the cast itself for several years . It was incredibly pivotal for my own sexual self-identity and allowed me a safe place to learn about this side of myself . There were people of all ages , sexual orientations and gender identities . It was an environment where it did n't  matter what you looked like , if you were gay or straight , old or young , experienced or nanve , kinky or vanilla . Everyone was accepted , and everyone was allowed the opportunity to express themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage on which to explore parts of themselves they might otherwise be afraid , embarrassed , or ashamed to whether due to pressures from their family , friends , religion , or society at large . It was a shared experience that opened us up to so much more of what the world has to offer . <p> Me , as Rocky in 2004 <p> When Rocky Horror Picture Show was first released in 1976 , it was an incredibly groundbreaking film for its time . It was completely unapologetic and had a campy , glitzy realness about it that was n't terribly commonplace yet . While America was a country just coming fresh out of the free-love era of the 60s , people who did n't  fit into traditional gender roles or were outright homosexual still were not terribly visible in mainstream media not to mention legislation . And when they WERE visible , they were almost never celebrated . This was a large part of what helped solidify RHPS as a crucially important piece of film for the LGBT community and why it has stood the test of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since spawned dozens of shadowcasts all around the world ( live casts performing the movie while it plays in the background , with a huge focus on audience participation , tropes and " callback " jokes ) , as well as a stage show that has been running nearly as long as the film . <p> So yes , I understand why the film is so sacred to so many of us . My experience is not uncommon many of my friends have similar stories about the impact Rocky Horror Picture Show has had on their sexuality and their lives . I understand that when something has had such a measurable influence on you as a person , it can be hard to accept any other version of it into your life . I know it feels like anything other than the original is a very affront to the core of your being . But let me counter with this : IF YOU FEEL THIS WAY , THIS FILM IS NOT FOR YOU . <p> Let 's look a bit , if you will , at the early history of gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out a mere 6 years after the Stonewall Riots in New York , a major turning point for the LGBT community ( although the T part of LGBT was still practically unheard of then more on that later ) . It was n't until 1970 that Hollywoods first attempt at a film specifically targeted at the gay demographic came out ; The Boys in the Band . Even so , this film received mixed response from the gay community . While it was an inarguably important first step for gay representation in film , it was also criticized for reinforcing certain negative gay stereotypes . THIS IS WHERE WE WERE , AS A COUNTRY , IN THE EARLY 1970s . <p> A photo from the New York Stonewall Riots in 1969 <p> The 1970s was a period of discovery and acceptance for gay and bisexual people in America . Art often imitates ( and influences ) life , and Hollywood was only beginning to realize the importance and size of this particular demographic . Film and TV an industry practically DOMINATED by LGBT workers , was still slow to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still often depicted as a joke or an insult . Even within geeky franchises such as Star Trek , the series Star Trek : Excelsior which meant to follow Captain Sulu in charge of his own ship was canceled after it was revealed actor George Takei was gay . The first televised same-sex kiss was n't even until 1991 . Same sex activities werent technically recognized as being legal until 2003 ! Twenty-two states plus Washington , D.C outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation , and twenty states plus Washington , D.C. outlaw discrimination based on gender identity or expression . Adopted of children by same sex couples is legal nationwide since 2015 , and gay and lesbian identifying people have been protected legally from employment discrimination since 2012s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . So while there is still work to be done for gay rights its a battle that we are winning , and have been winning for quite a while . <p> With that in mind , for a film to Rocky Horror Picture Show to exist in 1975 was improbable at best . It was loud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orientation and it never painted gay people in a negative light . Even the boring vanilla straight couple of Brad and Janet found themselves enjoying their sexual revolution once they had ( like their first ) opportunity to truly let go and explore . They probably were never exposed to anyone gay before their trip to " The Frankenstein place . " So this visibility was IMPORTANT . The entire country the world - was practically Brad and Janet at that point in our collective culture . <p> We have gone through many growing pains when it comes to gay acceptance in the 40 years since the films release . In 2014 , the FBI reported that 20.8% of hate crimes reported to police in 2013 were founded on perceived sexual orientation . 61% of those attacks were against gay men . And yes , its only been 3 years since gay marriage was legally recognized at the federal level , and even still there has been pushback to get these ( and other ) basic human rights revoked . Nobody is saying it is n't still hard to be gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it was in 1975 when Rocky Horror Picture Show was released . Since then , gay and lesbian representation in film has skyrocketed - so much so that Wikipedia literally had to break it down into 10 different subcategories just to document them all . Modern Family , which heavily features an openly gay couple ( who even adopts ! Gasp ! ) is in its 8th season and has won TWENTY ONE EMMY AWARDS , among countless other awards and nominations . <p> Now back to the Rocky Horror Picture Show remake . Keeping in mind that this is forty years after the original , and that the legal and cultural landscape of our country has changed . Why would we want to take a film that was so important for a generation of people and not modernize it to the problems that are facing our queer brothers and sisters in the world now ? Why would we not attempt to do with the new film what we did with the original , which is to give visibility to under and mis-represented LGBT actors ? Why is Laverne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect person to play the role of Doctor Scott ? I think she is . <p> Although of course no one will ever be Tim Curry how could they be ? He leaves undeniably big fishnets to fill , but that does n't  mean there is no room for anyone else to interpret the role . Literally hundreds of people have been doing this since the films original release . <p> Beyond the fact that I think its stupid in general to not attempt to update a 40 year old film visually ( yes the original costumes were iconic , but who wants to just recreate the same thing that has already been done ? ) , I think the intended outcome of rebooting a franchise should be to capture what made the original film special . Thematically , visually , and culturally . The original film did so much for gay and lesbian people at large , but the landscape of the world has changed , and transgender people need something that will do the same for them ; legitimize them , celebrate them . Tell them we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , and make a safe space for their self-expression . <p> Yes , Laverne Cox playing a transgender character on Orange is the New Black , a show that has received a lot of critical acclaim . But even on that show her character is a criminal with a lot of negative overtones . Transgender people are still often the butt of jokes , their identities are questioned , invalidated . According to surveys , 4.6 percent of the overall U.S. population has self-reported a suicide attempt , with that number climbing to between 10 and 20 percent for lesbian , gay or bisexual respondents . By comparison , 41 percent of trans or gender non-conforming people surveyed have attempted suicide . FORTY . ONE . PERCENT . This very year one of our biggest ongoing battles was for transgender rights to bathroom use . In 2016 , one of the biggest bigots our nation has ever seen against all rhyme and reason is the Republican nominee for president . White nationalists , racist and sexist Islamaphobes are literally marching openly on the street , spouting their messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens in droves . It is a scary goddamn time to be a religious , sexual or ethnic minority . There is an air of uncertainty as we reach what feels like our final battle between right vs wrong , good vs evil , with everyone believing they are right . And despite what anyone thinks , what is RIGHT is what protects everyone , not just what is best for YOU . <p> And in the midst of one of the most politically corrupt elections weve ever seen , when people are left with the constant fear of death just for being who they are , Laverne Cox has the audacity to be both transgender AND black . And for people to say that she is too feminine to play the part of Doctor Scott ? Fuck you . Too feminine , not feminine enough . There are plenty of people that would rather not see her in film at all . There are plenty of people who would rather see her not exist at all . There are plenty of people who would rather see her and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cox and Fox for bringing back Rocky Horror Picture Show when we as a country desperately need a reminder of how awesome and unshakeable we are . We will continue to fight the good fight and protect those who others would see stripped of their rights . <p> And at the end of the day , well stand together and do the time warp again .

With over 30k You Tube subscribers , two nerdcore albums and a director for Machinima we are happy to hear his thoughts and advice . <p> Q : So , TeamHeadKick . Give the run down for someone who is n't familiar with your work . A : We record studio mixed MP3 's catering to Video Games , and Gamers . We are the only band that records with live instruments , across multiple Genre 's of music . Taking Nerdcore to the next level . I 'm also a full time Gamer , and Film Maker . So naturally THK became a kind of " One stop shop " for Video Game entertainment . <p> Q : Your music is all over the map metal , rap , comedy . How is it you came to dabble in so many styles of music ? It seems unusual for a musician to do so many things so well . A : When we started this project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made up of two of us , Me and Todd . We grew up together , and were in several bands together in High School , and after . We both have a real love for Metal , Rock , and Progressive Music . I just happen to be a white guy that can rap , and have always enjoyed comedy , and making people laugh . Add the fact that all I do is game , and it became a natural way to express myself musically . While we get plenty of love for what we do , crossing genre 's of music is a dangerous thing to play with . Metal Fans hate rap , and vice versa , so our goal was to create a little something for everyone . So far so good . <p> Q : What is it that inspires you to write a song ? How do you choose which games to write about ? A : A good game is the inspiration , and that 's also how we choose our content . I look for a connection to a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I generally try and rap from a first person perspective to a Character in a game . One of our most popular raps " Make You Bleed " was a comedic look at what Ezio ( Assassin 's Creed ) Would look like as a bad ass womanizing pimp in the 1400 's . It came out great . <p> Q : Do you guys play any live shows ? Will we see you at PAX or E3 ? A : As of yet , THK has n't performed live . Mainly because our fanbase is so spread out , it would be hard to get them all in one place . Both Todd and I have a lifetime of playing live shows though , so this is something we expect to do down the road . As far as E3 or PAX , I go every year , and believe me , when we get the invite to perform live , we will ! <p> Q : Your third album , Nerdgasm , is on it 's way soon . What can people expect from it ? A : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of your favorite games . We like to give " value " to our music releases , and generally put 16 Songs on each album , that we sell for 9.99 on iTunes . This way Gamers , and fans can pick out just a few , or can purchase the whole album without going broke . Its a good mix of Rap , Techno , Metal , Rock , and even some Blues , and Dubstep . Most importantly , its a soundtrack to game WITH . Just makes playing that much more involved . <p> Q : Do you have any good stories about meeting fans or celebrities ? What has been your favorite TeamHeadKick moment to date ? A : At E3 This year , I got recognized by a few people , and was shocked to give out autographs , and take pictures with fans . I 've heard people in LA blasting our music from their cars , and its really humbling to me . The thing I love about gamers , is that they are die hard fans to their games .

Then its continuing on with videos , and music , and eventually a 4th album . Also , I 'm a Film Director , so ultimately I want to make feature films , and will do so under the THK name . <p> Q : Any advice for young geeks who are looking to get started doing what you do ?

For any readers who may not already be familiar with the team who or what are the East Coast Avengers ? <p> Liam : We are a Marvel Comics based group , who gather to promote charities , make hospital visits to sick children , promote children 's causes , and provide a cohesive identity for superhero cosplayers to be positive role models . We also gather at Conventions and other events as a group . <p> Our organization was founded to basically provide a collective identity for costuming fans with similar interests , the EAST COAST AVENGERS ( ECA ) are proud to put its resources to good use through promoting fund raising , charity work , and volunteerism .

We determine to Be the Change that we wish to see . We strive to provide an example to be aspired to . <p> Rogue : Well I think you 've managed that . Speaking personally , it was your cosplay group that initially inspired myself to start the work I 've done . Now , if I 'm not mistaken it was you that founded the East Coast Avengers , correct ? Where did that inspiration come from ? <p> Liam : I have been costuming for over 40 years now , and have been appearing at childrens events since the late 1970s . Whilst I was living in Arizona in 2009 , several friends and I ( Called The Founding Four ) wanted to start a group for Marvel Comics Superhero Cosplayers in there to band together to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . This was the first Avengers group , the Arizona Avengers ( AzA ) . We drew our basic framework from the 501st Star Wars groups . The group started in 2009 , and had its first major event at the Phoenix Comic Con in 2010 . I was voted as the first Commanding Officer of the AzA . Then I prepared to move to Virginia , and in preparation , I created the East Coast Avengers . Once I settled in Virginia , I began recruiting members for the ECA . The ECA has a Far Bigger field than than the AzA does . Instead of being set in one state , the ECA ranges from Maine to Florida . <p> Rogue : Thats incredible ! Now are the East Coast Avengers ( ECA ) and the Arizona Avengers the same team ? <p> Liam : We are separate Groups that are part of a larger collective , the Avengers Initiative ( AI ) . We are currently joined by the West Coast Avengers ( WCA ) , and the Avengers Mid Pacific ( AMP ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sufficient members in certain geographic areas to have sub groups split off and become full chapters of the AI themselves . <p> Rogue : It must be amazing to see your work grow like that ! Do the ECA attended conventions and other events ? <p> Liam : Indeed , we do . The ECA has been appearing at conventions up and down the coast , and attending Events such as Autism Awareness rallys , Cancer walks , and many other events mainly geared towards childrens causes . We have been invited to Andrews Air Force Base twice now , and look forward to continuing to attend events there , and at other military facilities , for the children and families there . We also attend film premiers , Free Comic Book days , and even some official events for Marvel Comics . Our members have been on TV several times , and in print many times now . <p> Rogue : Such a range of events !

Other Events can be found on our Facebook page . <p> Rogue : Do the ECA accept any and all cosplayers ? <p> Liam : The East Coast Avengers promotes creating , owning , and wearing the costumes from the Marvel Universe featured in films , comics , and television . To capture the magic of these characters , the goal is to portray an accurate presentation of the character through your individual costume . However , we recognize that this hobby centers around fun and creativity . Therefore , the East Coast Avengers make allowances for the creative modification of these costumes within the confines of decency ( defined as being without profane or vulgar features or statements and must be viewable by young children ) . Age , Race , Sex , Physical Ability , and Size are not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes ourselves . We Are the Change that we Preach . <p> Rogue : How many members are on the ECA ? <p> Liam : We currently have around 200 members , spread from Maine to Florida . <p> Rogue : How does the ECA feel about having characters that are " doubled " ( As in two wolverines etc . ) Do you request different versions ? <p> Liam : Duplicates are not only allowed , but encouraged . Quite often we find that not every character is available for an event , and back ups come in handy . Also , for example , if we should be visiting a childrens hospital , and there are two floors , having a Captain America for each floor is just good tactics . <p> Rogue : Thats marvelous ! Every pun intended . I know of groups that look down on doubles and with a select roster I never understood that . Now , being a Marvel group you do n't  have any DC rivals do you ? <p> Liam : No , every other costuming group that we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many members that are members of other groups as well .

So what is your favourite memory from the ECA ? <p> Liam : I have too many to pick , but generally , when one of the Supers connects on a Hero Level with a child , they are Both forever changed for the Better . The Smallest word , or even just Being there , can make a lasting impression on a child . In some cases , we are the First and Only time that anyone has done anything positive for a child , and we show that there is an alternative to the bad examples that they may see on the streets .

If it was n't for Noiz maybe I would n't have met so many people , but more about him you can read on the Blog section of my site . In the video section however , you can see the performance and our DMMD game play video that was suppose to be in the same time as our performance , but because of technical difficulties it was n't played .

@@34567555 @3567555/ <h> Haters Gone Hate A TL ; DR retelling of my year as Mr. Clever <p> Lisa recently wrote this personal blog about the ups and downs of her first year of cosplay , including the bullying and the hate and threats that she got . It 's very sad that so many of us have similar stories , here is hers ... <p> Its been over a year cosplaying as Mr. Clever . I 'm writing this because I wanted to document all of the ups and downs I have had in 2014 , because so many people have asked me to share my experiences . This whole post may ramble or seem to jump around but stay with me because there is a point to make in all this even if it takes a year to make it . <p> The most common question I get is " How did you get started ? " I started because all of my friends were having so much fun doing it , but could n't for the life of me find a character I was comfortable cosplaying . I hated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with Matt Smiths 11th Doctor and thought I 'd give that character a whirl . I tried different variations but none of them felt right . <p> I found a purple coat , which was n't easy because Im allergic to wool . I made the fob watch piece , the bow tie , the hand pulsar , and eventually made the chess board , chess set , the trigger unit , Claras gun , various pieces of self-stick gold foil , and my favorite accessory cybermites which have sort of become my signature . <p> I 've always been concerned about copyright issues regarding cosplay , so before I made the cybermites , I tracked down the original artist to make sure she was okay with my making them . Turns out she was . The costume was complete except for the cyberplanner piece itself . <p> I 'm highly allergic to latex , silicones , urethanes , Sculpey , most adhesives , plastics , wood dust , copper , and gold . Mind you , I did n't  realize that most of these were an issue until I had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in much screaming as I ripped it off my face and then much salve on my new found rashes and irritations . <p> Eventually , I managed to find about 8-10 different materials , blended together , that kind of worked . There are about 17-20 layers of various paints on it to make it look as screen accurate as possible . Its not perfect , but I made it myself , and I 'm quite proud of the look of it . Except it is extremely fragile . It breaks every time I use it . Keeping it attached for upwards of 14-17 hours a day , for 2-3 days in a row , is not an easy task . <p> It takes me about 1+ 2 hours to get into costume . The task of putting my hair to make it look like Matts takes about 30-40 minutes . Putting the cyberplanner piece itself on takes another 30-40 . <p> Removing it is just as difficult ; the slightest bit of pressure in the wrong area , and SNAP . I have to be careful to limit the contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , so I usually have to repaint the edges after every con . I use toothpicks to slowly pry it off my skin and the last step involves using scissors to cut it out of my hair . <p> Because it is so incredibly fragile I need to be aware of who is on my left side , at all times . I have to be aware of how and where I sit , how I turn my head , how I eat , how I drive , and how I interact with people . <p> At my first real con , Arisia 2014 , the Boston Whovians were having a large photo-shoot . I was dragged into it by a Whovian named Cat , who has since become a good friend of mine . I was anxious , panic-stricken , and overwhelmed by the amount of photos being taken . Most people do n't  realize how TERRIFIED I am of being in front of people , and of getting my picture taken . It was during this that I also realized I needed to be very careful with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in Cats hair after we posed together . <p> My friend , Lynn Wine , asked if she could get a photo of me alone . I reluctantly said yes , she snapped it , and I liked it , it was n't bad . I posted it somewhere , and I was shocked at the amount of places that photo has popped up since . <p> Arisia , 2014 . Photo by Lynn Cheney Wine <p> Despite my nervousness , I got involved with cosplay and Whovians groups , because I had such a great time at Arisia . Sadly , that con high did n't  last long . I started getting comments like " Why are you bothering , it was such a crappy episode " , " People will laugh at your cosplay unless its a femme version " , " A girl should n't be doing it , you 'll never get it to look right " , " Give up now , people will laugh at you " , " Maybe if you wore a skirt " , " You should pick a better character " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend drew a picture of Mr. Clever for me . I thought that was cool until they explained further ; " Anyone who would have a picture drawn from an episode that is largely reviled must make for an interesting follow , right ? " Is that supposed to be flattering ? <p> My photos were suddenly popping up everywhere , and seeing myself all the time made me cringe . The constant feeling of not being good enough , plus all the negative comments people were making , online and in person from people I thought were friends , was a lot for me . Around March , I was convinced that I was too old , too fat , too ugly , and that I looked stupid doing this . The new cyberplanner piece that I had was not holding up well anyway . So I trashed Cyberplanner 2.0 , thinking I shouldnt be doing this anyway . <p> After Anime Boston , where I debuted my Hello Clever costume , I reluctantly started working on Cyberplanner 3.0 , the one I still wear to this day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Free Comic Book Day , in NH . I was finally able to get a nice close-up shot , thanks to my husband . This photo also ended up being reposted , a lot . <p> Close up of my Mr. Clever cosplay . Photo by CJ Roberts <p> I had already planned to take the summer off because of the heat , but there ended up being so many more reasons . None of them good . <p> I do n't  make cosplay items professionally , but I am an artist . So pictures of my cosplay are on all my sites to show off my work . I posted the close-up photo on my Deviant Art page , my website , and other places . Then one of my followers on Deviant Art showed me this on Reddit . <p> It was flattering to be called " The Best " but this is when the worst of the hate started too . Someone thought I was transgender . Since all my social media sites are to display my art , most of them are public , so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and start sending me hate mail . In less than a day I got about 40 anon messages riddled with transgender hate . Things like : " You do n't  belong on Gods earth " , " If we see you at a con we will spit on you " , " We will key your car " , " You people confuse the rest of us " , " You shouldnt be allowed to live " , and , " We will show you " . <p> Eventually someone in the reddit thread commented on how I was actually a crossplayer . Well , then a different type of message came in . These were very sexually graphic , telling me that in order to be taken seriously as a cosplayer I needed to " show more skin " , that I need to " show my T and A. " ( I wont be explicit here , so keep in mind these messages were not G-rated ) They described the positions I should get into to prove that I 'm a girl , telling me to post pics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit on their faces , and that if they saw me in person theyd " show me how to be a real girl " . Yeah , things like that . I was in shock ; I sat in tears for days . <p> In the same period I was publicly scolded on a forum for " not playing nice with others " . And I was blocked from a cosplay group because I reported a racist comment made to another cosplayer . <p> People kept telling me that I 'm an idiot for liking Mr. Clever as much as I did , that I 'm not a real fan , that I 'm clearly too old , too fat , too female , not female enough , not showing enough skin , etc . So I began to think that maybe cosplay was just not for me . I took the summer off . <p> But not without first writing all of this down and sending it in to iCosplays Anti Bullying campaign site . They published my " story " on the hate and threats . This was quite a turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key in helping me understand that this sort of thing happens a lot but that we do n't  have to tolerate it . I became involved with their Anti Bullying campaign , and try to spread the word everywhere I go . <p> One day I had this epiphany . Despite all the haters and threats and people telling me I was worthless as a cosplayer , I had managed one great thing : I had met some of the best people I have ever known in my entire life . Not just con friends real friends , friends that I cant see my life without . Friends who told me that during all of this crap , I had inspired people to be themselves , and take chances , and be strong , and enjoy life . Con life had allowed all of us to come together . <p> So my friends convinced me to stick with being Mr. Clever , and we drove to Granite State Comic Con in Sept 2014 , where one of my good friends , Harley Bean , asked if I 'd be in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I cant even breathe if there are video cameras around . But it was for Harley . And Nerd Caliber , who have been supportive of me from the beginning . So I said yes . And wow , was that fun ! ! ! <p> We are about 2:22 in . <p> I also ended up getting into a cute selfie taken by my friend Christine . I tweeted it to BBC America . They responded . That was my first of three interactions with BBC America . <p> Selfie by Christine Evans . I 'm using a screen cap so the reply shows up . <p> At NYCC , the awesome NY Whovian cosplay group was having their own large photo-shoot . This was my first shoot since my time off , and I was floored by how welcomed I was . Gone were the people making fun of me for my choice of cosplay , now it was replaced with people coming up to tell me that they read my story on the bullying and were inspired to continue to cosplay because of me . Now people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been for me to push through this and how awesome it was that I did n't  quit . <p> The highlight for me at NYCC was posing for this picture and having Neil Gaiman reply to it . That meant the world to me . After all the crap I had been through since I started cosplaying one of his characters , it was nice to know that if nothing else , at least he thought it was ok ! <p> This made it all worth it . <p> In Nov , I wanted to attend LI Who , a Doctor Who themed con , but I was scared to go because I thought , as strange as it may sound , that if people found out I was n't watching the 12th Doctor yet they would hate me . It turned out to be the single greatest con I have ever attended . I got to meet Stephen Glastow who was one of the original cybermen . He remarked on how much how he loved my costume which was a real highlight for me . My friend Amanda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People were actually interested in what I had to say . <p> I decided to be in the TimeLord Timeline , a Whovian costume parade . Of course I had to represent NiS ( again Nightmare In Silver ) . I was lucky to have Emily with me , because when we got to the room and I saw a STAGE , I pretty much blacked out . I tried to leave but Emily would n't let me . When we were called , I panicked . So what do you do when you are stuck like a deer in headlights ? You throw cybermites into the audience . <p> I also agreed to do a video interview at LI Who with the wonderful Hansi Oppenheimer for her documentary " Squee : The Fangirl Documentary Project . " I ended up freezing and having a panic attack in front of the camera . Thank goodness for my pillar of strength , my friend Nikki . She jumped in to help . I think I talked about my love and admiration of all things Neil Gaiman and Matt Smith . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its weird to me that people know who I am now , instead of being this outcast of the community . People talk to me now like I have something interesting to say . Ive been interviewed a few times by various bloggers . And most of the groups that refused to interact with me are now asking me to post photos to their sites . I get requests to reenact scenes , and I see entire NiS groups at cons . A few people have told me , that because of me , they rewatched NiS and see it in a new light . <p> I suppose this is where I say " do n't  let the haters get you down " but the truth is they WILL get you down . This stuff hurts . All I can say to that is : Surround yourself with good friends . Look to people with similar experiences for inspiration and guidance . Find anti bullying groups and talk to people . Write it down , call them out , tell anyone who will listen . And never , ever think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every now and then . But for the most part , the most criticism I get now is the constant question of " When are you going to stop cosplaying as Mr. Clever " ?

So the character here is Lady Slytherin . Wife of Salazar . This was NOT I wan na be a princess there was SO much more that went into this than that . Salazar Slytherins wife is never mentioned , however we know the heir of Slytherin opened the Chamber of Secrets and we know at least two existing family heirlooms passed down for generations . With that knowledge and the time period , plus what we know if the character of Salazarhe had a wife . A wife who has not been named nor shown .

She had to in a way be a part of him because that is the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many things.we also know how all four founders are portrayed .

If rowena had a diadem his wife would have something better . If Rowena and Hufflepuff wore certain clothes hers would have to be different in another way . There is a whole lot more on the topic of him and on the concept of his wife that I have been working on and will post when it is finished but it is very in depth and I would like it to be perfect before I post it anywhere .

And of course jewelry replicas of both heirloom items as well as the cursed necklace just because it was the perfect colors and such a brilliant stand out piece .

Learn about the company 's history and her passion for video games and her mission to bring talented gamer &amp; geek girls to the work at gaming tradeshow events . <p> 1 . Tell me a little about your company and how it started . I 'd returned to the states after modeling and acting in Europe . It had been several years worth of photos and reels I was waiting on to get coverted from PAL to NTSC . For you youngins born in the 90s , that was what we had before DVDs : ) During the time awaiting my demo material for my agent , I was told by a new found friend that I 'd probably be interested in doing this " ' promo gig for this geeky gaming thingy convention in LA " that she was going to be working in June . I frightened her with a gasping squee of " E3 ? ! ? ! ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ! That 's it , you 've heard of it . " You must understand , at the time , 2005 , G4 , may it rest in peace , was not the widespread cable giant in gaming it once became . Originally ZDTV , bought by G4 a year earlier , did not do huge E3 coverage . There were only a small number of us who were loyal fans of the ever evolving tech show since its beginning . <p> It was a no-brainer , I applied to work the Nintendo Legend of Zelda booth that my friend suggested . The agent kept calling me to verify that I was really working it because it did not make sense to her as to why I would work a show that did not pay for flight and hotel since my pay would not cover my expenses incurred . Sending her the copy of my reservations helped ease her mind . Upon arriving at the gaming Mecca , I was completely shocked that there were not more gamers working the booths . You have to understand , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then realized that they are the pretty girls who get in the way of car photos at a car show ... well , that is the way I saw them . Game con booth babes were essentially untelevised on a widespread basis back in ' 05 . <p> Once I arrived for the orientation for the Nintendo booth , I soon discovered that out of the 100 girls , there was only one other girl who gamed . We were thrilled to be picked to work the end of the booth inside the walk through demo to hand out shirts . We arrived early and stayed late playing Twilight Princess on the Gamecube , which , for this game , I preferred to the Wii on which it was eventually released . I did interviews in several different languages before finding out that I was not supposed to speak to press because I was not a product specialist or Nintendo employee . I met a ton of people and even found the group for which I would end up being a journalist . I knew nothing about protocol . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our cards . The agency that hired me set me straight as soon as they found out . Of course , I quickly abided by the rules . If you are unfamiliar with this rule or why it exists , let me explain . I did not meet these people on my own , I met the contacts through them , their gig which allowed me to even be there , and the contacts were actually the agency 's contacts , not mine to be used . I really get that fact of importance now , but also did not steal any of their contacts once she explained it . <p> During the 3 day event , I cached my two 15 minute breaks with my 30 minute lunch break so I could have an hour to run like the wind to the other halls and check out everything I could while munching on trail mix I had brought . I was astounded to see that out of the hundreds and hundreds of booth babes , there were only a handful of gamers . Instantly I thought , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiney and complained about everything . They do n't really want to be here . It is just a paycheck to them . " Then voila ! The seeds for Charisma+2 were born . I just knew there would be a ton of gamer girls who would love to work this event . They just needed to learn how to she 'd their tomboy ways , even if just for show for a bit , and I could easily teach them how with my modeling background . <p> That summer , I became a QuakeCon girl in addition to becoming a journalist for AMN after meeting Ken Cauley , who gave me a chance to write for his site . For the next few years , I spent every dime I had , slept in bathtubs of friends ' hotel rooms , and worked my rear off because at that time , it was a very big uphill fight to be taken seriously as a female gamer and talent . There were a few , like Morgan Webb , who was an inspiration to me , and contemporaries like Jessica Chobot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still in its infancy . <p> 2 . Do you ever face any criticism or negative comments from people suggesting that your models are not " real " geek girls ? If so , how do you respond to them ? Ya know , I really do n't . I am just now , like as 2013 , starting to get a teeny bit of feedback from gamers who might have those feelings . Though , by now , almost all gamers know some females who are true gamers so it is less obscure than it once was . Up until now , I have only been talking with developers and publishers . I do not have throngs of fans or people who even know who I am . Truth be known , most of the people I work with regularly are only facebook if they are in a social marketing position at their studio . The people I know , making the games , are busy making games . By in large , social media guru devs like Cliff Bleszinski are quite a rare breed . <p> As far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first few years of convincing clients that my girls were not escorts , as well as , that contrary to whatever preconceived ideas they had about booth babes , my models were actually avid video gamers . Much to my surprise , even to this day , the majority of developers and publishers do not care whether their representatives game or not . After sending complimentary Charisma+2 2009 Calendars to my list of developers , publishers , and potential clients , we received more attention as a professional , innovative talent agency specializing in only gamer and cosplaying talent . The calendar showed the talent modeling or cosplaying on the top photo of the month and gaming photos under the calendar grid beneath . <p> Being new to the general public world of gamers , when I do get criticisms , which is rare , I usually just ignore it . I have a model with over 100K achievements , girls who have sponsored by NOS to compete in MLG , and as of this year have a stream that the doubters can view for themselves . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sound business since I already have a very narrow niche clientele . Casual games are an enormous part of our future as you know . When the Wii , Kinect , and Move came out , the growing fan base of casual gamers grew . So because I do not staff every kind of convention ( plumbing , boat , and furniture shows , etc. ) under the sun like 99.9% of the agencies out there , I am happy to accept all kinds of gaming clients , hardcore AAA studios to casual game developers . The girls do n't seem to mind either . I mean , getting to be a part of an exhibitor staff at E3 or the GDC floor is cool and is something outsiders dream of doing . The fan based cons like PAX and SDCC are equally as fun in a different way . Charisma+2 has been my only source of income and is completely professional , so making sound business sense is a necessity . Street cred is a distant and not important focus that can easily be proven by watching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 3 . I understand that some modeling agencies only look for a certain body type . Height , weight , facial features , etc . What do you look for ? This goes back to me having to bear in mind that the agency is a business . I have not restricted my talent pool to be only Maxim looking girls , though regardless of my efforts , I will not be able to reverse the fact that sex sells . Traditionally the " Maxim " type is what is most in demand . What I can do is try to help modify what is considered sexy . <p> If you have ever been to a game con , you will see that the majority of booth girls are not really all 11s on a scale of 1-10 . A great deal of it is presentation . I can help with that . Admittedly , two of my groups , guys and plus size girls , do not get nearly as many offers as the slender girls . However , I do submit the ones who have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe with the evolution of public perception through curvy stars and role models , even the game marketers are open to other options from time to time . <p> What is paramount for us at C+2 is that the talent , regardless of appearance , is a gamer . <p> What is paramount for us at C+2 is that the talent , regardless of appearance , is a gamer . As I mentioned before , I do have clients who are not hardcore gaming clients . First to come to mind is 2K play . The first time I worked with them was at E3 showing off a Dora fitness game . I had a model , the wife of a game developer , who loved fitness games . I needed someone who could play a fitness game for 8 hours/day for 3 days in a row . Her KDR did not really matter at all .

This may go back to the fact that most devs are actually making games rather than having time to indulge in playing them like they once did when they first entered the field . <p> I had gamed since the NES but did not own one so played at the arcade . It was not until I returned from Europe though that I began playing 40+ hours/week . My first completely submerged RPG was Baldur 's Gate Dark Alliance , which I played with my then boyfriend , now husband and endless hours with the FPS Unreal Tournament . I enjoy Action Adventure games most , but also like puzzle games , though I am horrific at the entire RTS genre .

What are some of your favorite titles and what are you looking forward to seeing in the future of the gaming industry ? My all time favorite had been God of War for years . Oblivion and Skyrim are way up there as well . I broke a blood vessel in my eye playing KOTOR , so that 's definitely one I played a lot . I do not play MMOs because I can not trust myself to be disciplined enough to turn them off . Recently I am playing Bioshock Infinite , Tomb Raider ( this last one is my favorite ) , CoD:BlOps2 , and Dance Central 3 . Off the top of my head , I 'm looking forward to Watch Dogs , The Last of Us ( which is supposed to be unlike Unchartered which I LOVE but I am sure Naughty Dog will make a great game ) and Deadpool .

Being a model requires confidence and poise . What advice would you give to a fellow geek girl or boy who has trouble with their self-esteem ? That is a big question . The quick answer would be to look at their idols without make-up , or off the set if it is a guy , and lots of before they were famous photos . A more in depth answer can be found here in an article I wrote a few years ago , " Why You Are Great : Even If No One Seems To See It " . I had enormous self-esteem issues for most of my life . Being a model may make it worse actually . People talk about how hard rejection is , well no one gets more rejection than models and actors . I just read last night that Matt LeBlanc had $11 to his name when he auditioned for Friends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While modeling in Europe , I had just as many tuna in a can and ramen noodle times as I did lobster and champagne . I 'd pay my mortgage as far in advance as I could when I landed a great deal because I never knew when the next gig would happen . <p> I really like this question , Leen . It is complex and could likely be an interview in and of itself . I agree with all the things I said above , but would also like to give a word of caution . I have seen it a zillion times . I help a girl ( this does n't really apply to guys very much it seems ) , they learn to do make-up , learn to wear more flattering clothes , get a few photo shoots ( TFCD ) and suddenly they see that , " wow ! I am not so bad after all ! " . They do a few cosplay contests or online voting things , maybe even land a booth babe gig , and suddenly they begin to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done for them . They start to think they poopoo ice cream , and the decent begins . The time varies , but they begin to realize that maybe they are not in fact the reincarnation of Helen of Troy and that perhaps , they have been asses to people who helped them get to the point of feeling good .

Dressing up is a way of creating an alter ego , a second skin which ones behaviour can be adjusted to and causes a person to be perceived differently . Just the two of us deals with both costumes and the people behind them . <p> The tradition of dressing up and wearing costumes has been part of many traditional special celebrations in society for centuries .

This increasing desire for transformation , the creation of a kind of parallel reality and identity , can without a doubt be related to increasingly difficult circumstances in society .

The choice of location is not a coincidence : Nowhere else is the ( abstract ) link between the person behind the mask and his or her alter ego as visible as in their own home .

On the photos of this series , however , the costume owners stay at home . In order to further emphasize this reversal , the people on the photos are ( opposed to the original purpose of the costume ) pictured quietly pursuing everyday activities . This setting allows the person behind the masquerade to shine through- the home and the individual activity are themselves and the activities are not exactly what would normally be expected of the character the costume portrays . The purpose of this setting is to create questions : Why did the person choose this particular costume ? Does the decoration style of the home give any kind of clues ? And , most importantly , the question at the centre of it all : Who on earth is hidden behind the mask ?

@@34567639 @3567639/ <h> 10 Shakespeare References in Disney <p> Article by : Rogue Benjamin <p> Geek Girl Northern Belle wrote this list of 10 Shakespeare references in Disney ... <p> William Shakespeare has had an incredible impact on the world we know today . His works have inspired artists of all kinds for generations . Growing up I read my first Shakespeare play when I was in grade six . My father suggested that instead of doing another terrible lip sync to whatever bubblegum pop song was my favourite at the time , I try a Shakespeare soliloquy . Selecting Mark Antonys speech to Caesars lifeless body I became enthralled and the rest as they say is history . One thing that has always frustrated me concerning Shakespeare is what I like to call " the Shakespeare Wall " . People hear the name Shakespeare and they go into a state of panicked illiteracy insisting they can not possibly understand . It starts in high school and while some people overcome it , for many others it snowballs . Yet while we may not all appreciate his plays in their original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespearean references woven into Disney flicks . This article will take a look at ten different Disney films and how they borrowed from the Bard . <p> 1 . Beauty and the Beast <p> During Disneys 1991 Release of Beauty and the Beast the villain Gaston uses a line of dialogue generally reserved for Lady Macbeth . During the mob song while he is riling up the villagers to go kill the Beast he says " Screw you courage to the sticking place " which is from Macbeth Act I. Scene VII , and parallels Lady Macbeth trying to rile up her husband to kill the king . <p> When Beauty and the Beast was re-released they added the song Human Again in after its immense success in the Broadway production . In addition to the song , there is a short scene at the end where Belle says " There never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo " as she finished reading Romeo and Juliet aloud to the Beast . He smiles and asks her to read it to him again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read , and Belle begins to teach him . It is only a thirty second scene , and it may seem trivial , but personally , I think those thirty seconds made the balcony scene at the end ever so much more beautiful . <p> 2 . Aladdin <p> When Aladdin makes his first wish to the Genie to become a prince , Genie runs through a magical spell book . Muttering to himself he says Caesar salad and an arm draped in a toga holding a dagger reaches out to stab him , to which he responds " Et tu Brute " and pushes the arm back down into the book and turns the page . This line comes from Julius Caesar Act III Scene I , Caesars dying words to Brutus . <p> Another Shakespearean reference within this film is Iago , named after the character in Othello . In Shakespeares play the character of Iago is an extremely manipulative villain , although no one except the audience has reason to distrust him . Similarly , Iago to the sultan is simply a mimicking bird that eats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 . Oliver and Company <p> In Oliver and Company the dogs all have drastically different personalities and Francis , the bulldog , is portrayed as somewhat snobbish with an appreciation for art and theatre and an abhorrence of anyone using a short form of his name . At one point during the film , Francis is seen watching television where a production of Macbeth is playing . Not only does Francis yell at Tito to keep it down while he is watching , but he also begins to mouth the words along side the television . <p> The scene played on the television shows Macbeth during his monologue in Act V Scene V. " Tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow . " The hopelessness that Macbeth feels in this speech is strongly felt among the vagabond canines who know Sykes might arrive at any time . <p> 4 . Pocahontas II : Journey To A New World <p> The sequel to Pocahontas , released in 1998 , this movie took Shakespearean references to whole new level . Opposed to a line of dialogue , Shakespeare himself is seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In London . As a gravedigger pushes his cart by , a skull rolls off the top into Shakespeares hand and he sings , " What is to be or not to be " , then as if inspired throws the skull away and begins writing on his parchment . <p> In reality Pocahontas ( already married and known as Rebecca Rolfe ) arrived in England in June of 1616 , while William Shakespeare died on April 23 1616 . Despite its crazy inaccuracies and terrible music I always enjoyed this sequel , its story and the animation . <p> 5 . Toy Story 3 <p> At the end of Toy Story 3 all the toys get together and not only reference but put on a stage performance of Romeo and Juliet . We see an adorable snippet of the infamous balcony scene with a hedgehog as Romeo and a Little Green Man as Juliet . He quotes But soft what light through yonder window breaks and the LGM quotes " Romeo oh Romeo wherefore art thou Romeo . " Both lines come from Act 2 Scene 2 , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the piggy bank and the horse are chuckling to themselves in the audience saying next season they want to do Cats or Hamlet . <p> 6 . Hunchback of Notre Dame <p> The Hunchback of Notre Dame has got to be the darkest Disney film on record . In fact without the addition of the three humorous stone gargoyles that come to life one might argue that it is n't even a kids film . As a result the film is littered with references for the adults including a subtle nod to William Shakespeares Merchant of Venice . <p> When we first meet the gargoyles they are trying to convince Quasimodo to attend the festival of fools instead of watching it from the bell tower . In an effort to explain their differences they mention how Quasimodo is flesh while they are mere stone . Then Victor , the more literate of the three speaks , " Yet , if you kick us , do we not flake ? If you moisten us , do we not grow moss ? " This comes from Merchant of Venices Act III Scene @ @ @ @ do we not die ? " <p> It is a particularly interesting reference considering that Merchant of Venice deals strongly with issues of racism between the Christians and the Jews and Hunchback of Notre Dame explores issues of racism between Frollos idea of the Christian Church and the Gypsies in France . <p> 7 . The Little Mermaid <p> While under the sea there seems to be little knowledge of Shakespeare , on land however even Scuttles managed to pick up a few references . Once Ariel has been given legs and is sent to woo Prince Eric , you might remember a cute little scene where they row out into this lagoon and Sebastian and all the fish sing Kiss The Girl . Well , before this , Scuttle tries to provide some " vocal romantic stimulation " . What you may not have realized is that this stimulation is actually a gull version of Tchaikovsky 's " Romeo and Juliet " . An interesting parallel considering that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speechless , just like Ariel while in the lagoon , until Sebastian comes to help the two along . <p> 8 . The Nightmare Before Christmas <p> This particular Disney movie has been a fan favourite for as long as I can remember , but for those unfamiliar with it , the lead character is a skeleton named Jack Skellington . This movie , like Pocahontas II , makes use of the skull and during Jacks Lament he takes off his head and sings , " And since I am dead , I can take off my head To recite Shakespearean quotations " , a reference to Hamlet . <p> The reason that both of these films and countless other Shakespeare references in pop culture use a man holding a skull comes from Hamlet Act 5 Scene 1 also famously known as " The Gravediggers Scene " . In this scene Hamlet is holding his friends skull in his hand and proclaims " Alas , poor Yorick ! I knew him , Horatio , a fellow of infinite jest , of most excellent fancy . " ( I.V.160 ) This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in pop culture and an easy one to make requiring only a skull at arms length . <p> 9 . The Lion King <p> Thanks to high schools everywhere this Disney flick is now the most recognized homage to Shakespeare . The story is loosely based on Shakespeares Hamlet with a few less deaths . ( Its the Disney version , what else would you expect ? ) For those unfamiliar with the parallels Claudius ( Scar ) kills his brother the King ( Mufasa ) . Hamlet ( Simba ) is visited by the ghost of his King father . He is led astray by Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern ( Timon and Pumba ) . He eventually returns to avenge for his fathers death and take back his throne . There have been many articles written about these parallels , a notable one here for those who are interested in delving deeper into this particular reference . <p> 10 . The Lion King II <p> It is a general rule that Disney sequels go straight to video and never live up to the majesty of the first . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King sequel . Unlike many other sequels at least the Lion King 2 had managed to keep most of the voice actors from the original movie . Also , like the original , this sequel was also loosely based on a Shakespearean play . This time it was the well known Romeo and Juliet . Again the plot is only loosely based with two characters from feuding families who fall in love and all the drama that ensues . Additionally , just the like the original , there are no where near as many deaths in the Disney version as in the actual play . However this plot arc is not the only Shakespearean reference in this movie . <p> When Kovu and Kiara are first found playing together by their respective parents Zira and Simba , it becomes clear that Simba is angry . He demands any relation of Scars is banished . He says , " You know the penalty for returning to the Pride Lands " and Zira snaps back " the child does not , but If you need a pound of flesh " and pushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeares The Merchant of Venice , where there character of Shylock , in a contract drawn up between him and Antonio states that if Antonio can not complete the repayment as arranged , that Shylock will be able to take a pound of flesh from him . <p> Shakespeare has influenced countless works of art , and is constantly mentioned in various forms of pop culture . So it comes as no surprise that the Disney world is full of tributes the bard . Of course some are much easier to spot such as the 2011 release Gnomeo and Juliet while others are heavily debated such as whether or not the three fates in Disneys 1997 Hercules are a reference to the three witches in Macbeth . The Shakespearean allusions within Disney come in many forms from plot devices to quotes , and I 'm sure the trend will continue into the future .

@@34567649 @3567649/ <h> How the Indiana Jones Films Were Just Han Solo 's Dream <p> As everyone knows , at the end of The Empire Strikes Back , the rogue-ish and daring adventurer Han Solo ( played by Harrison Ford ) was encased in carbonite . This left him in a coma-like state of suspended animation for one year ( in movie time ) , until the events of Return of the Jedi and his eventual rescue and reawakening by Luke and Leia . <p> After Empire , director George Lucas decided to take some time out and so made a little movie you might have heard about , Raiders of the Lost Ark , which starred Harrison Ford as a rogue-ish and daring adventurer . If you 've seen both films , you 'll know that Han and Indiana are identical in character : both are sarcastic , womanising smartasses with a taste for danger , riches/fortune and glory , leather clothing , and hanging out with hair-covered beasts with unintelligible accents . <p> What could this mean ? <p> The Theory : <p> Well , according to one theory , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than the dreams of a carbonite-encased Han Solo . <p> Firstly , Empire was released in 1980 , whilst Raiders was released in 1981 . In other words , Han being put into suspended animation and his subsequent dream happen in chronological order . <p> But , you might ask , if Indiana Jones is fictional , then where did Han get the idea for the Nazis from ? Simple : he modelled them after the Stormtroopers , the anonymous identically-dressed goons of the Empire , a totalitarian regime with the desire to conquer everything in sight . After all , they themselves were modelled on the Nazis own real-life Stormtroopers , so its not hard to imagine this influence being reversed in Hans carbonite-addled head . <p> Oh , and then there 's the numerous references to the Star Wars universe dotted throughout the Indiana Jones films . <p> This is taken from the end of the opening sequence to Raiders . Check out the I 'd of the plane on its tail : OB-CPO , after Obi-Wan Kenobi and C-3PO . <p> Then , during Raiders again , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Souls ( where Indiana finds the Ark ) . <p> The opening sequence of Temple of Doom takes place in Club Obi-Wan . <p> During the battle on the ship during the opening sequence ( again ? ! ) of Last Crusade , there are barrels of Carboneto onboard , a thinly-veiled reference to Carbonite . <p> And , finally , in Crystal Skull , these wall plaques of C-P30 and R2-D2 make an appearance in the Temple of Akator . <p> Clearly , Hans subconscious is inserting references to people and carbonite into his dreams . <p> Want more proof ? Well , how about the fact that there is n't a single reference to the Indiana Jones franchise in any of the Star Wars movies ? None whatsoever . If Han did dream the entire IJ series , then itd be logical that there are n't  any references to it in the real world , as there is n't anything to reference . After all , none of it really happened . Which is excellent news because then that means George Lucas did n't  destroy yet-another beloved franchise with awful-CGId @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Pin-up is a special obsession of mine because of the fun and sassy attitude that you get to play with . To achieve the look I used a flirtier Dorothy outfit and some very stylized posing . The pictures are also in both color and black and white since the movie was shot from both perspectives . I am very happy with the way that the pictures come out and hope others will enjoy them . "

Today I 'm sitting down with Max , the founder of the team . Hello Max , and thank you so much for taking the time to answer my questions ! So where did the inspiration for the League of Superheroes come from ? Max : I have always been a huge fan of comic books and movies based on those books . I admired the 501st and the work that they do both on their costumes and for charity . I wanted to create a group where others who had a passion for superhero/villain cosplay could gather and in turn , help raise money for children 's charities . <p> Rogue : I notice unlike many other groups , youve just used the label " superhero " . So it does n't  matter if the characters are Marvel , DC or dare I say it Darkhorse ? Max : We are strictly a Marvel/DC cosplay group . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar with some of the other publisher 's characters . <p> Rogue : Fair enough , and how many members does the LoS have ? Max : As of this interview we are at 27 . <p> Rogue : I noticed on your website that members are listed by their character name . Does that mean that people can don more than one character within the group ? Max : Of course they can ! As cosplayers all know cosplaying can be quite addictive and we encourage those those fueled by a passion for creating superhero/villain cosplays to continue to do so once their initial is approved . <p> Rogue : Similarly , how does your team feel about having doubles ? ( E.x . Two Spiderman cosplayers etc . ) Max : We welcome doubles . It helps ensure that that particular character will be at more events . One Spider-man is sick at home with the flu ? No problem because we have another volunteer who is anxious to wear their Spidey outfit ! <p> Rogue : I 'm sure people will be happy to know that ! So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would they need to do ? Max : To apply to The League Of Super Heroes , you must have either a Marvel or DC cosplay . We request you send in three , hi res , full length shots of you wearing your cosplay ( front , side and back ) and at least one reference shot of the character you are cosplaying as . <p> Rogue : Do the LoS have a specific geographical location ? Max : We are Ottawa , Ontario based and the surrounding area at the moment . <p> Rogue : The Canadian capital guarded by the League of Superheroes haha , that 's pretty awesome . What sort of events do you guys do as the LoS ? Max : We do mainly fundraisers , but we 've also done promotional appearances as well . Most recently we trooped at a local theatre to help promote the latest Xmen movie .

Our target audience is kids and these are excellent supporters of children 's needs . <p> Rogue : Do you guys have any events coming up that youd like to advertise ? Max : We 've just come off an extremely busy time so The League is taking a month off for vacation . Kinda like Xavier 's Academy shutting down for Summer Break ! <p> Rogue : Even superheroes need breaks right ! So in the mean time where else can our readers find you ?

@@34567664 @3567664/ <h> Cathy Lou Daughter of Cthuhlu Doll <p> Princess Nightmare shared the story of the Monster High doll she and her friends made into Cathy Lou , daughter of Cthuhlu ... <p> It all started on night during a D&amp;D Cthulhu campaign . Every time we ran into a werwolf or zombie etc I would grab one of my Monster High dolls from the shelf and all of the sudden we would be facing very fashionable adorable monsters . One day my best friend who happens to be the DM said to me ' just wait next one they will come out with will be Cathy Lou ' . <p> Never give an artist an idea .... <p> I decided to make Cathy Lou . Originally it was just going to be a reroot of Lagoona the daughter of the sea monster ... and then the project grew .... over 18 hours of rerooting the hair to look how I wanted it to look , the bit of green up front , the black with a significant space but the back with purples and greens with some strewn into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really big full head of hair . <p> Of course while working on this I got more ideas . She did n't seem like the type for freckles and to further distinguish her from Lagoona I took those off . <p> Next of course was she did n't have tentacles so 4 tentacles were to be added to her head on completion of her hair . Two on the sides as pigtails and two in the back low sort of hidden by her hair but still there . <p> Now that there were tentacles there had to be wings . However , Lagoona 's body does not have the holes for wings so I had to start looking around and I found a body from a Create your Own Monster website that did have the openings for wings and a slightly different body type from the original dolls . After that I went in search of limbs that could connect to it which I found from a Create Your Own Monster kit , it even had tentacles on the arms and fins on the legs . PERFECT ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Lagoona 's . <p> My best friend took over from here deducing how to create the exact right paint color . It took him a full day to figure it out but he did ! <p> He was in charge of then painting Cathy and it was officially our project . <p> From here we started to give her her personality , she is shy and nerdy , the type that wears graphic tees but with leather jackets , skirt , and boots . She 's a nerd and a gamer , my best friend brilliantly came up with her favorite activity is ' houses and humans ' <p> Somewhere in the middle of that I realized how much we were putting into this and how much it meant to both of us and frankly how cool the doll was , so I decided I would like to see if I could get her a following and give her some adventures ( visiting Monster High , Boo York Comicon , and some other things ) . She has both an Instagram and a Facebook page ! <p> We continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we finished Cathy with the touches of her green accents , I took apart and took off some pieces and added some pieces an existing Monster High skirt-originally it was suppose to be a skirt made of stingray but the fabric I had was too thick and did not look right so plan B was to disassemble and assemble another skirt , the jacket was an old Bratz jacket which we completely took apart and put together differently with some of the original jacket with some other additions . her shirt is a shirt belonging to Sirena VonBoo the mermaid ghost who happened to be wearing a shirt with tentacles and her other alternate shirt is the Deadfast shirt ( the superhero in the Monster High world that the brilliant and geeky Ghoulia loves ) , her big boots with this ensemble is reminiscent of me and my other best friend growing up being the part goth part fashionable , she loved her boots , I loved my heels and boots . These boots were from the Elissabat doll and cut in order to display her leg fins . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we realized her hair hid her tentacles so I had to remove some of it . <p> Following that the only thing that I thought was off were her hands , all sea/swimming creatures at Monster High have webbed hands . However the body I had was from a Create Your Own Monster set which you can not interchange parts except for heads , so we could n't use Lagoona 's hands . After a brief search I found white and pink webbed hands for her that we repainted so she had proper webbed hands as well . <p> Her finishing touches were her jewelry . As all the dolls have she got a necklace and earrings . Her earrings are re-painted fish bones that were Lagoona 's earrings , and her necklace a small chain necklace i made . <p> Lastly she has a cuff at the top of one of her ears because when I was younger that 's what I had and many of her personality traits remind me of myself . <p> Once complete I could n't stop . I got onto the Monster High website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of her own . I could n't match the font so I did it letter by letter , copy and pasting , to begin her profile for the top parts and used a similar font for the rest . <p> Cathy Lou was on display at our booth at New York Comicon AND You can follow Cathy on Facebook and Instagram . <p> Mattel is a company I have loved for a very long time , and i have never felt like I have had anything to contribute to them until now . I do hope someday they see this idea , and until then .... let the adventures begin ! ! !

@@34567678 @3567678/ <h> Wasteland Weekend 2013 <p> If last year 's event coverage of Wasteland Weekend was n't enough to get you there this year , then allow me to do a better job this time around ... Because if you were n't at Wasteland Weekend 2013 , you really missed out . <p> Wasteland Weekend is a 4 day festival in the desert of California , about 2 hours drive from Los Angeles . Wasteland was in it 's 4th year this yet , and it has proven to be the best so far . Based mainly on the Mad Max trilogy , it also pays homage to many other films , games and stories from the genre . <p> ( Geek Girl Zelda at Wasteland Weekend 2013 ) <p> THE SCENE <p> The setting at Wasteland is exactly what you would imagine from hearing the name . It is located a good distance from any kind of civilization and you have to travel several miles on dirt road to reach the location . When you arrive , you are greeted by people in full post-apocalyptic regalia , and allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An entire tent city is set up outside of Bartertown , which has walls built from metal , scraps , vehicles , and every manner of thing . Two turrets are set atop the Wasteland gates , allowing you safe passage into the main area . Inside are many themed tribes , encampments , vendors , and attractions . Everything was built down to the smallest details , and the way things look together creates an amazing overall effect . There is desert and mountains on every side of us ; every night we get treated to an incredible panoramic sunset over Bartertown , and a neverending expanse of stars at night . The trade off for being in this natural beauty in such an awesome is having to give up some of your modern comforts . There is no running water or showers , and there will be times your private parts have to hover just inches above piles of drunken stranger 's poop in the porta potties ( only slightly less barbaric than the actual apocalypse is sure to be ) It 's dirty , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , and loud music and drunken reveling happens until the late hours of the night - it 's the wasteland . If you plan on coming , make sure you can hang . <p> Bartertown is not just a name , but in fact how most of the event operates . We brought with us several old costume pieces , miscellaneous scrap and crafting supplies , hygiene products and miscellaneous odds and ends . I came away with tons of new clothing pieces and crafting supplies , and people were happy to have my stuff too . Some items could be purchased for bottle caps , which are earned various ways throughout the event . Several things were sold for next to nothing , traded for , or freely given away . The system creates a super close sense of community , and it 's a ton of fun to treasure hunt and haggle among the people who attend , as you 'll never know what you might come home with . <p> THE PEOPLE , THE MUSIC , AND THE PERFORMERS <p> The people who attend Wasteland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not the same crowd as you 'd expect at Burning Man Wasteland attracts far more from the punk , metal , industrial , fetish , burlesque , survivalist , historical re-enactor , gun-nut , diehard movie fan , military and " alternative " type of geeks . Los Angelinos claim the biggest percentage of people at the event , since it is in our backyard , but people come from all over the country and even internationally for it . I do n't think there is another event out there like it , or as perfect a location . It 's not so much the free-loving hippie and artist type of community you 'd find there , and the drug culture is not as strong ( although is still definitely present ) . Police and medics are present onsite to look after you and make sure people are safe Although to be honest , the police looked like they were having just as much fun , and had even brought out a post-apocalyptic ride of their own . Despite the amount of weapons , leather , fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social environment . If you go to Wasteland Weekend and did n't come away with a bunch of new friends , you 're not doing it right . <p> The music is generally what you 'd expect from the crowd ; punk , metal and rock bands playing live and industrial and EDM DJ sets later in the night . The bands came from all over to perform on the Wasteland stage . The vocalist for one of the bands even married his fiance there ( after proposing to her on the Wasteland stage last year ) . Performances consisted of burlesque , fetish , fire spinning , fire fighting , heavy combat in the Thunderdome ( I now realize that nearly all of the Thunderdome fighters were SCA members with slightly modified armor ) , whip shows , and theatrical acts of all sorts . <p> THE COSTUMES <p> Costumes are required at this event , which makes it especially cool to be a part of . Absolutely everyone who attends participates , and even the people with little to no costume experience make some pretty solid efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costumes you will see , however , are OUTRAGEOUSLY good . Most of the work are original designs , with a few people rocking recreations from movies , games and comics . The costume contest this year was hosted by the Boulet Brothers , 2 notoriously over the top club promoters from Hollywood . Nudity is not unheard of either here I witnessed boobs of all types , wet t-shirt/weiner contests , cock socks , and full male nudity in the mosh pit . Did I mention this event is 18 and up ? <p> THE VEHICLES <p> What would a Mad Max weekend be without badass vehicles ? Luckily we did n't have to find out , because Wasteland has them everywhere you look . Cars , trucks , motorcycles , A/Vs , scooters , bicycles , and every combination in between . There are replica Interceptors , guns , blades and cages mounted on everything , and vehicles that have been modified from the remains of everything imaginable . The time and love that people put into their vehicles is even more impressive than the costumes . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the end , the bike that was modified with a speedboat and harpoon , and the car with the mermaid boat prow on the end . Everything that people brought was amazing though , and I hope I get the chance to be a part of the elite crew of post-apocalyptic car owners , and it 's only PARTIALLY so I can make all the damage on my car look like it on purpose . The main reason is because they all look badass ! You have to wonder how often they get pulled over in these monsters , though . Some of the cars at the event are clearly not street legal , and I wonder how they got some of them here at all ( In pieces , I would imagine ) . The vehicles come from all across the country . <p> THE ACTIVITIES AND ATTRACTIONS <p> Wasteland is the type of place you can do as much or as little as you 'd like . At any given time , there are at least 2-3 scheduled events that are cool , plenty of permanent structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as personal and neighboring camps where you can go to relax or socialize . Inside the walls of Bartertown , there is the main stage ; It 's mostly used for bands , but other types of events happen here as well too . The costume contest and auctions also go on here , made out of mostly donated goods from the attendees . Each night , several bands play until the late hours , after which , Djs and recorded music take over . Dancing and fire shows , auctions , games , and Jugger matches occur as well . <p> Jugger is an easy game to follow and a lot of fun to watch ( and to play , I imagine ) . 2 teams try to score points by spiking a skull onto a stick while surviving the onslaught of the opposing teams and their arsenal of bizarre padded weapons . There is more to it than that , but not much . ( By the way , the Juggers are starting their own post-apocalyptic event in SoCal meant to be like Ren Faire in a post-apocalyptic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Wasteland Weekend , called Green Zone 11 ) . <p> Other permanent attractions within the city walls include The Mushroomcloud Lounge , a hookah bar who 's lounging area included pillows , car seats , tires , and broken cushions . The hookahs were strange , beautiful abominations of metal and ropes and twisty bits . Across the way is the Atomic Cafe , the bar which serves bizarre drinks in tin cans or your own glass . There is also the WCC ( Wasteland Communication Corps ) Post Office , where letters can actually be sent . I even received a joke letter from a fellow Wastelander . There is also the Pit , a firepit where most of the dancing occurs . The Last Chance Casino had poker , roulette and other games happening . Oh , and did I mention that all of these things , including the bar , are absolutely free ? You can earn bottle caps at the casino , which initially have to be earned by performing trips or donating , but these caps can then be used at various vendors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual video game , at times . <p> Besides these things , you can join in on games . There were games on the main stage , as well as an ongoing bounty hunting game put on by the Rust Devils tribe that went on throughout the entire event . You could earn bounties by hunting people down check out the photo for the full list of rules . <p> This is just the tip of the iceberg . There was no shortage of things to do at any given time , planned or unplanned . I heard late into Saturday night " fire Jenga " was even invented , and it 's exactly what it sounds like . <p> The final day of Wasteland is a relaxing one . We closed ours out by joining a neighboring tribe to slice through beer cans and coconuts with the various bladed weaponry we had brought . Across the way from us , someone flies a kite . A little farther , an excellent sermon about God as the atom bomb goes on . I watch as slowly more and more people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it 's a pretty great final goodbye to the experience . <p> I have no doubt that next year 's event will be even bigger and better , so make sure not to miss it !

Star Trek pushes boundaries in a lot of ways that other television shows just do n't do .

There are hilarious moments with Worf and the boys during the Klingon " bachelor " party and we get to meet Martok 's wife Sirella , a magnificent woman with no sense of humour and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episode where we get to see Klingon traditions never before seen and some great strong scenes between Sirella and Jadzia .

First off , I 'd like to say that the Intendant ( mirror Kira Nerys ) is one of my favourite characters on the show . She is powerful , sexy , completely sure of herself and her costume is killer ( also on my to-do list lol ) . I always love any MU episode because of her . However this episode also boats a few other surprises , most notably an appearance from MU Tuvok from Voyager . He is part of the Rebellion along with Bashir , O'Brien and Dax who also has ' interesting ' relationship with the other Sisko . Benjamin does get some lovely scenes with his wife 's MU counterpart , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Season 4 Episode 482 <p> This is such a fabulous episode . Based on the 60 's spy flicks of Bond , " Our Man Flint " and others , this show is a great romp that the regular actors of the show get to have fun playing a completely different character . These are always my favourite ( like Far Beyond the Stars mentioned above ) . The whole design of the show is amazing as well , costumes , hair , music and sets all complete this wonderful episode . There is a transporter accident that ends up with Sisko , Kira , Worf and Dax 's patterns being stored in the stations memory . The place where they end up is in Bashir 's spy holosuite programme . Julian and Garek always play exceedingly well off each other and the four that get stored in the programme are hilarious at playing their various roles .

And this one is no exception . Facets brings us the discovery of Jadzia 's past hosts , where she asks her friends on the station to participate in a Trill ceremony that allows to meet her hosts and come to grips with who they are and what they have given her . Hilarious moments ensue when Quark is asked to embody Audrid , a female and when Sisko is most definitely threatening as Joran .

Possibly her worst fear imaginable . This episode is so powerful because you are completely immersed in this Cardassian household with a man who is convinced that Kira is his daughter . The scenes between Nana Visitor and Lawrence Pressman ( Tekeny Ghemor ) are just lovely , seeing the love he has for his lost daughter and the eventual love that Kira finds for this man , a Cardassian , is truly lovely . Wonderful acting all around . Now she looked amazing as her most hated alien nemesis , but a bit of trivia here , Nana Visitor is actually extremely claustrophobic so the Cardassian makeup was torturous , " I was a prisoner " she said about it . <p> Sons of Mogh - Season 4 Episode 487 <p> This episode is heartbreaking . Worf 's brother Kurn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ritual where Worf has to kill his brother to return his honour so that he may enter Sto-Vo-Kor . Worf 's family had been disgraced and shuned from the council so Kurn has nowhere to go . They try having him work for station security and it just does n't work . Through a collection of other incidents that happen , Worf comes to the decision to have Bashir wipe Kurn 's memory and get him a new identity with a family friend . The performances of Michael Dorn and Tony Todd are not to be missed . <p> In The Pale Moonlight - Season 6 Episode 543 <p> This episode is an interesting one . I love the direction in that Sisko is actually talking directly to the camera while recording a personal log about a series of events that lead the Romulans joining forces with the Federation in the Dominion War . This whole episode is about Sisko coming to terms with agreeing to use Garek 's questionable methods . Avery Brooks is great in the episode and I adore Andrew J. Robinson as Garek . Wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top ten . <p> Children of Time - Season 5 Episode 520 <p> This is such a beautiful episode . A must watch , time travel and sacrifice , this is the episode that Odo 's feelings are revealed to Kira with grave circumstances . Wonderful and poignant acting by Auberjenois and definitely a bitter sweet ending to the episode . <p> As I was going through the series I realized how many of the episodes that I loved , so I believe that I will have to write a second list at some point to get them all in .

@@34567694 @3567694/ <h> Confessions of a Cosplay Couple <p> There are many secrets out there . Things we keep from friends , family or the public at large . The whole reason I fell in love with cosplay is because it means that you do n't  have to hide the fact that you want to dress around in spandex as a superhero . Cosplay is about celebrating not only who you are and what you love , but the ideals that you live your life by . When I choose a cosplay character I pick someone I truly identify with and try to push the line beyond just wearing the same outfit and embody that character . <p> Cosplay is about not having to hide the fact that you love something so much that youd change your appearance to fit into that world . It is about not hiding your passion so why would you hide someone that you loved ? <p> Now there are many people out there who are not extroverted or have no desire to be in the lime light . I can respect that . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosplaying as Rogue since I was sixteen , long before I met my boy . Since having been together he has built a Gambit cosplay that he wears to conventions along side me . Having said that , he often jokes and says " I 'm just an accessory . " I respect this . I respect that my love is a geek computer nerd who would much rather be behind a screen than in the light and we find ways to make it work so I can shine , but he does n't  need to feel threatened . I 'm not afraid to kiss him at conventions lest everyone know I 'm not really available and start to " unlike " my facebook page but we are not all over each other either . <p> We are not the only cosplaying couple we know . A good friend of mine Rachey Lockdust cosplays as Black Cat with her boyfriend Deidara Cosplay dresses as Spiderman . Now this is not to say that if you are a couple you MUST cosplay as a couple , but let me tell you when ever I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Honestly , its a highlight for me at a con when I find another cosplayin couple as a traditional duo within the geek world . One of my favourite cosplayers Margie Cox is my favourite for that exact reason . I was drawn to her work where frequently there are pictures of her and her husband cosplaying together . Of all their combinations I 'm partial to their Psylocke and Cyclops , which are absolutely perfect . <p> Yet there are ways to cosplay together without needing to advertise that you are in each others beds at nights . Fan Expo last year the Cajun and I ran into this lovely duo Andrea Polcz and Mike Joe cosplaying as Poison Ivy and Two Face respectively , this past weekend we saw them again only this time as Green Arrow and Black Canary . It had n't  occurred to us the first time we met these two that they were a couple , but regardless they looked fantastic together . Now let 's be honest the general experience is " Oh hey look awesome costumes ! " Take a snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it matter if they are together , siblings or strangers ? <p> " But I do n't  like dressing up ! So I 'm stuck as a secret ! " This is probably the comment I hear all the time that drives me absolutely bonkers . So you do n't  like dressing up in spandex , or maybe you are n't  comfortable with your body type , it is completely understandable we all have different comfort levels . At this point , in my mind , you have two options ; one pick a cosplay like Constantine or Gwen Stacey where you pretty much just wearing regular clothes OR you act like one of the most fantastic couples I know That Joker Guy an his lady Erin . <p> The first time I have active memory of That Joker Guy was 2009 , he was hard to miss all painted behind his table of Joker related artwork . To be honest I 've no recollection of Erin at all , but I do n't  doubt for a second that she was there by his side . Since actually meeting them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sean Ward Show , Ive come to know these two as some of the kindest people out there . Every time Ive seen them Joker is dressed as one would expect and Erin is there with her bright blue jacket beside him . Be it at filming events , charity walks or conventions I 've never seen these two apart . These two built up their own geek worlds growing up and managed to seamlessly blend them when they married in 2005 . Since I 've known them I 've never seen Erin in cosplay , so the idea that both parties must- be in costume otherwise your not together is ludicrous . <p> Now very recently I read an article about being a Secret Cosplay Boyfriend and I understand that we all have our own experiences and perspectives and I respect that . However to cap the article by stating - " At the same time , I admit that there were times over the years that I lost interest in following a cosplay girl online because she had a boyfriend or a husband .

Who cares if people wont like your page because you have a significant other ? If that 's all it takes they are shallow nothings anyway . This is about YOU expressing what you love to do so stop allowing " fame " , especially of the social media variety to dictate how you live your life or express your love . <p> As Gandhi said best ; Be the change you want to see in the world .

@@34567697 @3567697/ <h> An In Depth Look at Disney 's Beauty and the Beast <p> Article by : Rogue Benjamin <p> Geek Girl Northern Belle wrote this in depth look at Disneys Beauty and the Beast ... <p> Released in 1991 , Beauty and the Beast is the movie that defined my child hood . To this day my father can still quote every word , and jokes to all my family about a time when I would beg Watch it with me just one more time Daddy ! Maybe it was the fact that Belle grows up a social outcast with a single father and no real explanation as to where her mother went . At the age of two I certainly was n't conscious of these parallels but looking back I cant help but wonder what exactly it was about Beauty and the Beast that made me obsess over it more than any other story in my life . <p> The plot is pretty basic . It is based on the fairy tale Le Belle et la BOte by Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont , which in turn was based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve . To that end , there are hundreds of versions of this story to date , some of which end drastically differently from the Disney story we all know and love . For those of you that are somehow unfamiliar with this classic Disney version it goes a little something like this <p> There 's a castle where a boy refuses a beggar woman to stay for the night and she transforms him into a hideous Beast who must make someone fall in love with him before an enchanted rose wilts . <p> Belle , lives with her inventor father Maurice in a small French town where everyone thinks he s nuts and she 's weird . Fortunately the arrogant hottie of the town , Gaston , thinks Belle is the most beautiful girl in town , so it does n't  matter that she 's weird , hell marry her because prettiest = best . Belles father goes off to an inventors fair and gets lost . Gaston proposes to Belle , and abhorred by his proposal she runs out into a field to sing with dandelions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father must be lost and she runs off in search of him . <p> Finding a giant creepy castle and her fathers hat , Belle wanders into a strange building . Finding he father locked away she selflessly offers to trade her life for his . A prisoner in his castle , the Beast is at least nice enough to give her a room instead of locking her in the tower . Belle goes wandering into the one place in the entire castle she knows shes not supposed to go and Beast yells at her . She gets emotional and decides this is the deal breaker and that she ca n't stay here anymore . She runs out into the woods , gets cornered by wolves and then needs the Beast to save her life . He s wounded , they go back to the castle and she fixes him up . He decides to do something nice for her and so he shows her the library . Time passes and through the efforts of the enchanted objects ( formerly servants in the castle ) the Beast gets a little Tamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in fancy clothes and in love . However its not all happy endings yet . Suddenly Belle gets all forlorn missing Daddy and Beast gives her an enchanted mirror which will allow her to see him . <p> One look in the mirror and Daddy is lost in the woods again , ( This time because the villagers thought him crazy and refused to help him save Belle from a Beast ) Beast has real emotions and sets her free and Belle runs after her father . Taking Maurice home to take care of him , Gaston shows up at their cottage door and demands that if Belle does n't  marry him , her father will be locked away in an insane asylum . To prove her fathers sanity she shows the villagers the Beast in the magic mirror ( and they all freak out over the beast , not the shiny magic glass that is glowing and acting like a television , which wont be invented for another hundred years or so ) and then they lock Belle in a cellar and head to the castle to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dashes off to the castle . The villagers get their butts kicked by a bunch of enchanted objects , ( although there is rather questionable moment with a villager and the feather duster ) and Gaston attacks the Beast . Beast , without Belle has no reason to live , or so he assumes , and does n't  fight back . Suddenly he sees Belle pull up and decides to defend himself . During all this the Beast wins and let 's Gaston go , but ever the jerk , Gaston attacks again and ends up falling to his death . The last petal of the enchanted rose falls and everyone thinks Beast is dead , Belle cries over him and then suddenly there are fireworks and the most disappointing transformation of all time . The Beast is now a prince , the enchanted objects get to be human again , and everyone gets a happy ending . <p> As a child I accepted this plot at face value . It was teaching me not to judge a book by its cover and even deeper , to treat others the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got older that I started asking myself questions about the story line . Now I 'm not just referencing the Stockholm syndrome appeal for this story , I 'm sure we 've all heard this negative connotation about the film . For those unaware , Stockholm syndrome , also known as capture-bonding is a psychological occurrence where hostages express empathy , sympathy or other positive feelings towards their captors . This can be to the point of defending them or even loving them . Now with this basic definition it is easy to see how this fairy tale can be analyzed through this lens , but as I stated , this analysis has been done to death . Plus I have other questions for Disney . <p> The biggest one is where are the parents ? ! And why is this enchantress taking all her rage against humanity out on an eleven year old boy ? Did I lose you ? Let me explain , in the opening prologue the narrator states " The rose which she had offered was truly an enchanted rose which would bloom until his 21st year " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Be Out Guest much later and says , " 10 years we 've been rusting , needing so much more than dusting . " , it would lead us to believe that the Beast was 11 years old when he was transformed . Now do n't  get me wrong , I 'm not a huge fan of kids in general and I firmly believe in disciplining them , but does n't  this seem a bit extreme ? Furthermore to take it out on the whole castlemakes me wonder whether or not this Enchantress had some anger issues . Now sure one could argue , if there are no parents , then it has been up to those working in the castle to raise this prince and thus it is their fault that he is " spoiled selfish and unkind " but it still seems a bit outrageous to me . <p> On the fact that this boy was 11 when he was transformed who the heck is in that portrait ? ! While I appreciate the fact that they wanted symmetry between the man who appears at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather ludicrous given the time frame . <p> Furthermore Chip a child who is his father ? How was he born ? How did Mrs. Potts have another child at her age ? Was he born a cup ? I have a lot of questions regarding chip . <p> Also , while I agreed that a decade is a long time , it does n't  really seem like a long enough time for a village to completely forget about a castle and prince particularly one that is enchanted . Did this royal family have no actual leadership over this town ? And if not , you are seriously telling me that nobody tried to rob what might have appeared to be an abandoned castle to either come back with horror stories or not come back at all and be the birth of horror stories ? The fact that it is just the mystery place in the woods that people can both find with great certainty ( all the villagers and Gaston at the end despite not knowing of its existence ) or can never seem to find it ( Belles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were already here before , did you honestly forget the way ? ) Part of me feels that the castle must have been sitting on the rift to another reality , cause none of this makes sense in my brain . <p> Another major question Ive always had , although less important to the plot when Belle is out in the woods and gets attacked by the wolves , Beast comes to her rescue . He in turn is attacked and ends up passing out how exactly does Belle manage to get the Beast upon Phillipe ? Not to be rude here , Belle may be brilliant , but filled with Wonder Womans Amazonian super strength she is not ! I remember this actually bothering me a lot as a child , long before I 'd given thought to any of the other questions bred by this movie . That and why Gaston ate eggs , shells and all , and what would have happened if Belle touched the rose ? ! Okay , I guess Ive always had a lot of questions . <p> As with any movie there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example during the opening number Little Town , Belles book changes placement in the basket as well as colour , there is even a moment where the basket disappears all together . My favourite part of this number is when Belle is reading by the fountain and one of the sheep eats part of the page . ( If you look closely at the picture on the page you 'll notice that it is in fact Belle and the Prince ) . However moments after the song is finished Gaston picks up her book and wonders how she can read it due to the fact that there are no pictures in it , despite the fact they just showed us a close up of one . Also concerning Gaston , during his number the bear rug travels on its own from shot to shot , and when Belle rejects his proposal you seem him fall out of the door way , but then the door slams shut from the inside . With Gaston comes his blonde minions , I 've always wanted to find two other ladies and do these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I choose ? ! Youll notice throughout the movie sometimes they all have the same hairstyle , while at other times the parts in their hair move or they have Ariel-like bangs . Other continuity errors include the wishing well outside Belles house that disappears later when Chip comes to free her , Belles magical apron that appears and disappears during the mob scene , Belles ability to magically put her coat on while running down the stairs when shed previously left it in her room and the number of claw marks on the Princes portrait . I 'm sure there are many more throughout the movie , but these were the ones that always cause me to ponder , or be proud of me observation skills . <p> To that end Disney is also infamous for its many crossovers and Easter eggs , and if you werent already aware of this , you may spend the next two weeks re-watching all your favourites . Beauty and the Beast is brimming with these crossovers , my favourite of which is that Gastons horse is the same horse from The Adventures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . That 's right , Gaston and the Headless Horseman share the same steed ! This film also reused footage from both Sleeping Beauty and the Black Cauldron . In the final dance sequence between Belle and the Prince animators reused crowd footage for the people surrounding the couple from Sleeping Beauty . Similarly the smoke screen that Beast transforms in , is footage from the Black Cauldron . <p> Not only does Disneys Beauty and the Beast feature other Disney films , but the characters have been known to travel . The most commonly spotted is Beast in Disneys Aladdin . When the Sultan is building up all his toys if you his pause you can see Beast among the figurines . Belle is also a wanderer being featured in the crowd scene of " Out There " , during Disneys Hunchback of Notre Dame , and as a figurine on Morgans mantle in Disneys Enchanted . During Disneys Tangled when Rapunzel and Flynn are surrounded by dozens of books , one of them is Beauty and the Beast . Perhaps more popular than either of the title characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These two are featured in Disneys Tarzan , Meet the Robinsons and An Extremely Goofy Movie . During the Lion King 1 + there is a scene where many of the characters are seen in shadow including Belle , Beast , Mrs. Potts and Chip ! <p> Personally , my favourite references in Beauty and the Beast were always the Shakespearean ones . Now if you 've only watched the original release , unfortunately you 're missing the best one . In the re-release of the film they added the song Human Again back in after its immense success during the Broadway show . In addition to the song , there is a short scene at the end where Belle says " There never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo " as she finished reading Romeo and Juliet aloud to the Beast . He smiles and asks her to read it to him again . Here we learn that the Beast has never learned how to read , and Belle begins to teach him . It is only a thirty second scene , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds made the balcony scene at the end ever so much more beautiful . Yes , that 's right folks , the balcony scene at the end when Beast climbs up to meet Belle is a Shakespearean parallel . The second , subtler parallel is the reference to Macbeth . During the mob song when Gaston is leading the villagers to the castle one of the lines of the song is " Screw your courage to the sticking place " which is spoken by Lady Macbeth in Act I Scene VII , when she is trying to drum up the courage in her husband to kill the king . <p> There are a lot of other fun things to catch in this movie too . For example , did you know that when Gaston falls of the cliff , in one of the frames just before his tragic demise you can see skulls reflected in his eyes ? ( However this will not be seen in the VHS or laserdisc release , only the theatrical and DVD release ) . If you are native to California , when Maurice is lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names on the signs including Anaheim and Valencia . Additionally some of the more adult humour such as Cogsworths line " Flowers , chocolates , promises you do n't intend to keep ... " was in fact ad-libbed by David Ogden Stiers and not a part of the original script . Additional adult humor can be found during Little Town when Belle walks up on a cart while reading her book and a creepy villager leans down to look under her skirt . Fortunately the karmatic balance of Disney leads to him getting clocked by the same ramp that Belle is walking up and with stars around his head he falls to the ground . <p> For those who have any knowledge of French , the names are also fun . The easiest of which to translate is Belle meaning Beauty , but also Lumiere meaning light or LeFou , Gastons sidekick , whose name translates into the fool , or the crazy one . Other puns include Mrs. Potts for a teapot , Chip for the chipped tea cup and Monsieur DArque a play on dark for the asylum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this film is interesting as well . You may not have noticed initially , but did you realize that Belle is the only character to wear blue ? Well , that is until the Beast dons his blue suit . This is to help drive the point home about how different they are and feel . <p> The use of statues is fun too . All the creepy creatures that surround the castle while it is cursed , most of them are in fact earlier art concepts for the Beast . The one fun thing Ive never been able to get behind however is the use of Adam as a name for the prince . Why you ask , because it is not his name at all . <p> According to the directors commentary , the Beast never had a name he was simply known as Beast , or the Prince . So where did Adam come from ? We can thank the 1998 video game The D Show that was developed by Cyberflix . It was in this game that it was stated that the Beasts name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no part in its development , the mistake went viral . To this day there is TONS of merchandise with the name Prince Adam slapped on it , none of which I find desirable . Its Beast or nothing for this gal . <p> One criticism I like to challenge everyone who comes in contact with the story to consider is that this is very much the Disney version . For years the film has been dragged over the coals as people believe that the movie is implying women should stay with their abusive boyfriends/husbands . However in many other versions , including the original , the Beast was not this nasty piece of work that has to be changed by Belle . This is the Disney version . Perhaps my favourite incarnation of this story is by the author Donna Jo Napoli . She contrasts Islamic and French cultures/traditions with a Persian prince and a French merchants daughter . In this story the poor prince was actually trying to assist someone and ends up being cursed by a mischievous spirit . Why they chose in the Disney version to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also think it is important to consider that while Belle may be one of the main characters in the film , the story is Beasts . It is about his growth and maturation , it is his journey that we follow . <p> For a long time Disneys Beauty and the Beast was the only animated film to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture . ( Until Disney-Pixars Up in 2009 ) While it was nominated for Best Picture it lost to Silence of the Lambs , however it was the first full length animated featured to win the Golden Globe for Best Picture ( Musical or Comedy ) . <p> The one real tragedy of this film is that Howard Ashman , the lyricist , died before the movie was completed . During the making of the film many of the animators were sent to New York to work with Ashman and Menken , although many believed it was a big shot attitude , not because he was HIV positive . As they continued to work it became evident how sick Howard Ashman was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a metaphor for people struggling with AIDs , with its parallels of not judging a book by its cover , and the mob song reminiscent of the mob mentality in retaliation those with AIDs . There is an in depth article reviewing this here . <p> Regardless of the possible metaphors in the story , the death of Howard Ashman was tragic . Howard Ashman passed away four days after the films first screening , never seeing the finished production himself . At the end of Beauty and the Beast one can see the credit " To our friend Howard , who gave a mermaid her voice and a beast his soul , we will be forever grateful . " <p> As a child , all I knew was that I wanted to be Belle and that this movie was the bees knees . Yet as I get older and began to reflect upon not only the movie itself , but the story , its history it is all these layers that routinely keeps Beauty and the Beast on the top of my playlist . All these little elements have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With thanks to my good friend Do n't  Panic Cosplay , who is making Belles yellow dress for me , I will be debuting my first ever Belle cosplay Fan Expo Canada 2014 and I can not wait to relive this story again in a whole new way
