" With anything new comes excitement around possibilities and eagerness to get started . However , making sure that a supplier relationship gets off on the right foot means starting strong with onboarding and enablement . These are often lumped together as one process , but they 're two distinct activities , with separate outcomes . <p> And , both are equally critical . <p> Of course , success with a new technology provider rests on many factors , from the solution itself to market opportunity . However , regardless of the quality of a product or its business potential , without a sound onboarding and enablement , an engagement can fall flat . I 've found that the best relationships are rooted in a sense of mutual ownership and teamwork around a joint offering . Over the course of my career , in the most beneficial programs , all sides collaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each party to feel like an extension of the others team . <p> Of course , that does n't  happen on its own , just as generating revenue and being profitable do n't  just happen by equipping people with marketing and sales content . The key is to teach them when and how to use the resources and provide tools to help along the way . <p> As a partner , if you question the level of commitment and investment from a vendor , its difficult to have confidence that the elements are in place for success . How do you recognize a supplier that 's dedicated to working together ? Best practices to watch for include : <p> Regularly generated high-value content ; <p> Instructional videos and guides focused on when and how to use the resources ; <p> Tools to help build business plans , execute marketing campaigns and improve close rates ; and <p> Accessibility via an on-demand system . <p> Its important that you have easy access to the right set of activities and content to keep positive momentum going . Now , let 's look at both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broken Down <p> During onboarding , its essential to work closely with a channel manager to develop three critical components for going to market . You cant expect to see adoption of partnership , execution and revenue growth goals without spending the time during onboarding to build the following : <p> A business plan : Make sure there is a level set of priorities and expectations , and that corresponding goals are understood . " Why are we going to market together ? " and " What are we trying to achieve together ? " are key to ensuring that there will be clarity on the joint value , objectives and alignment of stakeholders , teams and their roles in making the partnership a success . <p> A marketing plan : Agreement on the strategy for growing revenue together , along with the necessary cobranded sales and marketing content , will be critical in communicating the overall value proposition . <p> A training plan : Identify how to integrate into existing marketing and sales rhythm . This content is needed to ensure everyone knows how to market , sell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to a variety of sales and marketing content , internal systems and billing processes , and a scheduled cadence of activities to monitor the success of the partnership during the onboarding process . All of this is necessary before training begins for marketing , sales and technical teams . <h> Enabling Partners <p> An enablement program should have plug-and-play content that fits into a larger framework that fulfills what is needed to deliver on the business and marketing plan . The enablement phase is the time to learn how to market , sell and support products as well as the brand . It is also a transition from onboarding state to effectively and profitably becoming an extension of a solution providers brand and team . <p> I recommend looking for three enablement tracks to get the most out of a partnership : marketing , sales and technical . Each track maps to the buyers journey , supplies the resources needed to support activities that happen during each phase and recommends tools for advancing the opportunity . Training should be designed to naturally progress through the cycle , perhaps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructional guides and tools to help effectively market , sell or support products and joint solution offerings . <h> Its Go Time <p> The onboarding and enablement experience sets the tone and raises the energy for an initial launch in significant ways . It is essential to feel confident in the process and be sure the salesforce feels adequately prepared to achieve both organizations goals and objectives . That synergy goes a long way and allows for continued learning and combined growth of your businesses . <p> Erin Figer is the partner marketing manager at Armor , the First Totally Secure Cloud Company that keeps sensitive , regulated data safe and compliant in the cloud .

" The idea behind this threadbare axiom is a good one : A team must work as a unified group , with all attention and effort focused on a common goal ; a selfish player can throw the team off balance . But its important to remember that while a team is working as a unified group , its also a collection of individuals . As another popular phrase puts it , " Theres no I in team , but there is a me . ' " The individual members of a team must never disappear into the collective effort . This minimizes and undermines their dedication and importance to attaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be appreciated and recognized for their respective contribution to the overall enterprise . There is a " me " in matters , too , and every team member must feel that they do. ad <p> Pick up a program at any sports event and you 're going to see a team roster with photos , names and stats . In any given game , there will be some players who make spectacular plays and some who never leave the bench . And that 's likely to change from game to game . But the dynamic of team play is that each member is ready and willing to do their best whenever they are called on . If you take another look at that roster , you 're likely to notice something else : Each member of the team has a distinct position " - or role " based on their particular talents .

At the same time , we need to feel that what we are doing to earn that paycheck is appreciated ; that our contributions are valued .

It appears to have started with the news of the telecom 's intended $34 billion- acquisition of Level 3 , announced last October , and confirmation , weeks later , of the sale of its data centers and colocation business to BC Partners for $2.25 billion in cash . <p> CenturyLink executives have been vocal about the 80-year-old company 's strategic and aggressive transformation . Today , CenturyLink 's message is that the company will continue to be the one-stop solution for the hybrid IT needs for its customers and remains committed to a wide range of IT services , including managed hosting , cloud and network , as well as colocation , through a strategic relationship with BC Partners . ad <p> This year , the acquisition of Seal Consulting , a SAP solutions provider for enterprise-wide business and technology needs , will add about 4,000 SAP consultants to CenturyLink 's roster . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its IT and managed services business ; further enhancing its application transformation capabilities and expanding its commitment to the SAP ecosystem and to providing integrated **26;0;TOOLONG solutions . <p> And with that , the company revamped its Alliance program , in February . Expansion of its Alliance program was designed to better serve enterprise customers with advanced communications and IT solutions . It also offers channel partners four routes to partnership : the Channel Alliance ; Software Alliance ; Systems Integrator Alliance ; and Strategic Partner Alliance . <p> We caught up with Gahn Lane , vice president , software industry at CenturyLink at Dell EMC World 2017 , and talked about CenturyLink 's makeover , the channel and where they 're going from here . <p> Channel Partners : Let 's talk about changes at CenturyLink . <p> Gahn Lane : - Like many of the leaders at CenturyLink , I 've been here less than a year . Most of us are fairly new because the company is reinventing itself . They recruited a lot of folks with a background in channel , telecom , software , distribution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern telco and we do n't want to be that anymore . <p> We have a tremendous amount of intellectual capital that we brought into the company , and it 's not to replace people , it 's to invest and inject enthusiasm " particularly for the channel . <p> When the deals with Seal and Level 3 close , we 're going to be the biggest B2B player in North America and one of the biggest in the world . So when you think about that " and look at our competitors " they 're focused on subsidizing the iPhone or content or buying Yahoo or trying to get bought by Sony , we 're not . <p> We divested that and are strictly focused on cloud , managed services , B2B and software . It 's a big change for us and big differentiator . <p> CP : Tell us more about your responsibilities . <p> GL : The business I run is software , so I own all the software clients and partners in CenturyLink . We have about 4,000 software company clients ( ISVs ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dependent on our network , our managed services , our cloud , etc . <p> My team 's job is to do two things " and I inherited a substantial direct sales business , and that 's great , we 're not getting out of the direct sales business " but , we need to have a channel business and CenturyLink does n't have a history of partnering . <p> We built a partner program and launched it in February , and one thing about it that 's different and important to the channel world " traditional channel partner programs are built on volume , Gold , Platinum , etc. , - and there 's nothing wrong with that . But , software partners do n't click like that , number one . Number two , if you 're new , the barrier to entry is pretty high . So we built it on go-to-market needs and demands . <p> There are four paths you can take : traditional channel , where you have software and if you need our network and resell our network nothing wrong with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you well ; the next is MSP " you want to deliver the whole thing to the client , white label . Those two , you 're selling it . <p> The third and fourth path , we 're selling it : we have an online marketplace , called Gateway " and your software can sit in our marketplace and my guys can sell it . We 've had the cloud marketplace for less than a year . The fourth path , is invitation only , and we call that Accelerator . That 's where we would ask you to join and we 'd totally integrate your software into an offer and we 'd sell it on your behalf , just like we 'd sell a Cisco router , etc. , but the point is none of those are a disadvantage for a software company ; it 's a matter of what they need and where the fit . <p> CP : What 's CenturyLink 's relationship with Dell EMC ? <p> GL : What Dell EMC brings to the table is parts and pieces that allow us to deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to say to the client , pick what you want , we want to say , here are two flavors you can buy and these are who we 're going to focus on and have a relationship with " these are tested and guaranteed <p> Channel Partners spoke with Jay Snyder , senior vice president , global alliances , service providers and industries , who told us that his organization looks at telcos through two different lenses : traditional carrier who has its own networking business ; - a dedicated business that 's six months old and their job is to build features , functions and solution engineer capability specifically for the carrier domain . So , network function virtualization , real-time intelligence , all the things that carriers are trying to do today . <p> The second lens for telcos is their hosting business , their cloud service provider business , how they want to go to market , and they 're all trying to launch those or take those to the next level , he said . " We focus on these telcos as Alliance Partners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry specific or geographical in nature or technical in nature , and we go to market through them . They host our technology and solutions just like a Rackspace would , and they sell those out to the marketplace , " Snyder explained . <p> AT&amp;T , Verizon , CenturyLink , and Rogers , are examples of North American Dell EMC cloud service provider partners . This second lens for telcos is a channel play , or how are we going to sell our solutions with them in the market to their existing customer base or new customers , he said . <p> GL : We also developed Cloud Application Manager ( CAM ) . So if you have cloud with us or with Amazon or Microsoft , for example , we have deep relationships with them , we can manage all that for you with one pane of glass . It also allows us to easily shift your workloads we want to be able to support you no matter what basket you put your eggs in . <p> That 's not the way telcos operated . It was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a totally different approach . <p> We 're not exiting our core businesses that we have in place , we 're not laying off our employees , this is layering on and building for the future . <p> CP : So what would you like readers to take away ? <p> GL : CenturyLink is moving aggressively into the channel space and is very committed to this strategy . 193521 @qwx393521

Take a critical look : Can partner relationships evolve alongside the supplier ? Who are your partners ? How are you supporting them ? How can you capitalize on mutual strengths to grow to scale ? <p> From day one , our channel partners have been a fundamental piece of our videoconferencing business . As such , we invested significant amounts of time and energy into building collaborative , authentic relationships . But , as the market shifted and our business evolved , we had to reevaluate how best to enable our channel partners . <p> At first , we were building servers and dedicated on-premises appliances " an operating model perfectly suited for a healthy channel relationship . The market , however , took a turn ; as we continued to manufacture and sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure , the world around us began to move to the cloud . So in 2014 , we initiated a complete reinvention of our business to a cloud service delivery platform coupled with our flagship HD camera and phone systems for conference rooms . <p> The software-as-a-service ( SaaS ) model was driving different expectations for our prospective buyers , however , which meant we had to adjust our course , as did our partners . Looking back at lessons learned , two important pillars stand out in navigating channel relationships through a transition . <p> 1. - Shift the Relationship and Take Ownership <p> To ensure opportunity for growth and scale , vendors and partners alike need to be open to evaluating and evolving their relationship to better enable success . <p> For example , in most cases , partners will not have the manpower to engage in vast marketing efforts around a new product . That 's OK . Suppliers should allow partners to focus on their core values , while they provide the solution and positioning and drive customer expectations . Building customer loyalty should not fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . Enabling prospective buyers to understand why your product is the best in its field will allow your partners to have more meaningful ( and successful ) conversations during sales . <p> 2. - Take a Holistic Approach to the Customer Experience <p> This strategy ultimately means taking an all-inclusive approach to the customer life cycle . This is not just a selling relationship- " it 's a complete customer experience relationship that enables the best support possible . <p> Why does this matter ? <p> In short : growth . Success as a company " particularly as a SaaS provider " is dependent on being able to maximize retention to continue to grow annual recurring revenue ( ARR ) . That 's also a critical goal for partners . One of the best ways to achieve that is to work together to create a holistic , positive experience that extends throughout the customer life cycle " starting at the brand promise , through the sales process and continuing long after . This philosophy , which is aptly dubbed customer obsession , sets a new bar for customer service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with channel relationships . When a supplier and its partners are running full steam ahead on two separate tracks , customers feel it " and not in a positive way . <p> Channel relationships should be based on a relationship , not a loosely structured agreement . When the channel succeeds , the supplier succeeds " and vice versa . <p> For partners , that means : <p> Look for supplier partners thatwork hard to be in step and that enable you as much as possible to exceed expectations at every stage of the customer relationship . This enablement should include deep conversations about the relationship structure , thorough education about the product , an online repository of tools and training , and " most importantly- " a commitment to being a partner to you as much as you are to them . <p> Constantly assess the stability of relationships when a business undergoes change . After all , these relationships enable your ability to engage directly with buyers . As a partner , you 're the boots on the ground " in times of challenge and success , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and come out on top . <p> Craig Malloy is CEO of- Lifesize- and is on a mission to reinvent the video communications industry .

And at this year 's Automation Nation 2017 , there are- more than- 800 attendees , the most for any spring event . Additionally , newcomers are flocking . About two-thirds of attendees at the tech-oriented conference are first-timers . <p> ConnectWises Arnie Bellini <p> We caught up with Bellini at Automation Nation 2017 this week- in Orlando . He outlined the company 's strategic vision . <p> Channel Partners : The company 's focus on MSPs seems to be changing , or expanding to other partner types . This sounds like a new business strategy road map for ConnectWise . <p> Arnie Bellini : ConnectWise has always been about serving technology solution providers ( TSAs ) . Managed services were just this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shores about 12 years ago . So yes , we aggressively embraced that , because it represented an opportunity for our partners to be able to shift their revenue from project revenue to recurring revenue . It required new technologies and us- making sure that we were providing the solutions that our partners need to become managed service providers . <p> Our focus has always been on identifying those waves of technology that are hitting the shore , and trying to identify them two and three years out . So our philosophy and our strategy has never changed . It just so happens that the craze has been managed services . <p> What 's hitting the shores now is providing cloud services . ConnectWise making a strong investment in research and development has created a product called CloudConsole that allows any technology solution provider to be a very effective cloud services provider ( CSP ) , or in other words , open a practice area or team or division- " people call it different things . <p> Cloud services is that big practice area that is coming out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There 's another wave that 's hitting the shore soon and its security . <p> CP : Let 's talk about the security wave . <p> AB : Security is the number one discussion in the boardrooms all around the world today . So you 're going to see- ConnectWise address this , and you already see us addressing this and it 's allowing technology solution providers to be able to open up a division or practice area for managed security service providers , or MSSPs . An MSSP practice is the next thing that you 're going to see , so we 're working on putting all of that together so partners can easily open up a security division of their company and use the- ConnectWise solution to accomplish that . <p> So , to get back to your original question , we do n't move away from anything , we move forward and keep adding and that 's what you see with these technology companies , they keep adding practice areas . <p> CP : It 's tough for partners to open up new practice areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How will you help partner firms expand to become MSSPs ? <p> AB : The way we look at managed security is a little bit different . We focus on specific concepts at ConnectWise . We have certain belief systems , and one of our belief systems is rooted in Michael E. Gerber 's book , " The E Myth . " His concept is : You want to have expert systems ; you do n't want to have expert people . If you 're going to build your business with expert people then you 're going to pay a lot for them and they 're not redundant and you have no backup plan for that , and it 's going to be expensive . If you build an expert system , you can plug ordinary people into that expert system . So what we 're going to do is create that expert system and we 're going to plug in ordinary people . <p> That 's the only way , in my opinion , that we 'll be able to bring managed security to the masses . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice . Very similar to what we did with managed services- " - ConnectWise was very instrumental in making sure that managed services did n't require you to have a fantastic guru expert . We wanted to bring that to all technology solution providers . <p> We will create an expert system for managed-security services with amazing tools connected to it so that system is the expert and we can plug in ordinary people . <p> If you look at managed security , there are- like eight components to it and every technology service provider and every managed service provider- is doing the top three the bottom rungs of it . For example , 90 percent- of- ConnectWise TSPs deliver endpoint security " the bottom rung- " to their customers . They may also offer DNS , MDM , managed firewall , disc encryption , advanced threat and password management , etc . <p> But then you have to move up the pyramid , so what we 're going to be doing is plugging in all the types of security solution choices for them because we 're a wide-open ecosystem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestrating a managed security practice inside of there . <p> CP : What timeframe are you talking about ? <p> AB : Our work is underway right now and you 'll see the first parts of our work as soon as IT Nation in November . At that time , we 'll be talking about what we 're doing and we 'll be making an announcement about a managed security services practice inside the- ConnectWise suite .. <p> I have to use the entire- ConnectWise suite to pull off any of these new waves that hit . They 'll have five major touch points with every customer- " creating awareness , evaluation , implementation , support and invoicing . <p> So , CloudConsole is our answer for cloud . For MSSP , you 'll get an announcement on that and all of those things continue to grow . So , for example , with CloudConsole we solved the problem for Microsoft Office 365 monitoring , management and billing , and we added Azure to that , so then what you 're saying is the entire Microsoft stack that most small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> CP : Looking ahead , what about IoT ? <p> AB : We 'll be all over things . Things represent additional opportunities for our partners and they are being commercialized . Things will also create a blurred line between technology companies and non-technology companies ; Gartner is right when they say every company is an IT company . Every company will employ all kinds of technology , which is the only way to gain higher productivity in the workforce and in business . So , to bring a bigger bottom line is to automate , be proactive and create expert systems that we can plug ordinary people into . <p> Our partners are great at technology , but with 3 percent- unemployment in the- technology field , that 's a problem so what can you do to fix that ? If you did n't know that was a problem , the next time you try to hire someone , it 's going to cost a lot more , and the next time you lose someone , you may find out that they 're actually getting paid more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture . We 're going to a holistic approach with technology solution providers , meaning that we want to help them with every aspect of their business , not just our software . It 's not just about software with us . We 're about best practices , having them driving success into their business from any angle necessary . <p> We need to give everything , yes , great software , yes , looking out into the future and solving those problems today , but how about helping you retain your employees today ?

Gartner says spending on information security will reach $90 billion in 2017 , an increase of 7.6 percent over 2016 , and top $113 billion by 2020 . Analysts expect spending on better detection and response capabilities to be a key priority for buyers . A recent Forbes Insight survey shows 68 percent of respondents plan to enhance their incident-response capabilities in the next 12 months . <p> Partners looking to help customers strengthen their security postures may want to connect with a security incident response and forensics firm , or even add such a practice , to proactively protect your clients before they experience a breach . Here are three reasons this is a worthwhile investment . <p> 1 . It can bring you additional sales opportunities . <p> If your clients are subject to regulatory standards such as PCI DSS , HIPAA , SOX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to have an incident-response capability . By partnering with a cybersecurity incident response team , you can enhance your position as trusted adviser by helping them ensure they 're in compliance with industry mandates . It can also lead to additional sales opportunities for you . For instance , the cybersecurity incident response team might identify weaknesses in the clients IT security that you can help address . <p> 2 . It demonstrates you 've got your clients best interests at heart . <p> When it comes to cyberattacks , the common view is that its not a matter of if a company will be attacked , but when . Today , the view is changing from " when " an attempt will be made to " when will we be successfully attacked . " Only the largest enterprises can afford to have an IR ( incident response ) team in-house . It takes specialized and well-equipped personnel to deal with attacks they must work expertly and efficiently to minimize loss , protect the organization from further damage and restore operations . Experts can work side by side with your clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take and when to take them . By using industry-leading tools to capture and analyze the data in a forensically sound way , they give your client insight into what has been compromised and how it was done . And of course , they can help clean up after the incident and make sure the problem that let the attacker in is fixed . Having this level of security experience at hand can be a strong selling point as you talk to prospects . <p> When clients have a cybersecurity-incident response team on retainer , that team can become familiar with the customers business and infrastructure and thus can act quickly and effectively if an attack occurs . In my experience , its much more cost-effective to have a team on retainer than to pay them after a breach has occurred . <p> 3 . It protects your business . <p> When a breach occurs , failure to maintain chain-of-custody and therefore the ability to ensure the integrity of collected data may result in the validity of that data being questioned . This is particularly true when working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as your own organization . Given how closely you no doubt are working with your clients , the last thing you want is to inadvertently compromise data forensics as a result of less-than-optimal chain-of-custody procedures . <p> With 79 percent of companies having experienced a cybercrime in the past 12 months , selling your solution with a cybersecurity-incident response plan is in your clients best interests and yours . At the end of the day , partnering with an incident response team enhances your capabilities with specialized expertise that will strengthen your position as a trusted adviser for your clients and could lead to additional sales opportunities . <p> As vice president of channel sales for ViaWest , Isaiah Hogberg is responsible for managing strategic partnerships along with driving and delivering hybrid IT solution sales for the channel partner program . 193521 @qwx393521

@@37500394 @6500394/ <p> We asked some of the panelists to preview their session . The transcript has been edited for length and clarity . <p> Channel Partners : What 's one benefit SD-WAN brings to the channel ? <p> Mike Sapien : SD-WAN allows channel partners to provide new integration services and broker network providers that increase revenue and stickiness with customers . SD-WAN requires that the channel partner manage customer expectations and network services as well as help the customer select the mix of different SD-WAN options and network providers underlying SD-WAN. ad <p> Steve Woo : A robust SD-WAN solution provides the channel a network architecture and platform for easily delivering additional networking services as well as managed services . Ease-of-service insertion now enables the distribution of security to multiple regional locations as well as leveraging cloud based solutions . Complementary network functions virtualization ( NFV ) support on SD-WAN devices also enables easy provisioning of additional services directly to the branch site . Services such as next-generation firewalls with threat protection or advanced voice quality monitoring can be deployed without requiring additional hardware nor on-site visits . <p> Meg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the client , and thus gaining more revenue . SD-WAN is fairly new , and still being vetted out by many clients . If the agent can 193520 @qwx393520 <p> become an expert on this technology , what it means specifically to the client , then they will win more deals . Also , clients are tired of being held hostage by the carriers with an MPLS network . The agent can help their client get more control , have more tools to manage , and get more potential optimization through this technology . <p> CP : What 's a misconception people have about SD-WAN ? <p> MS : Many customers may get the sense that SD-WAN is a totally new service . It is really similar to hybrid WAN services which have been around for years which provide connectivity with a mix of network types and providers but now with software ( software-defined ) to provide more visibility , control and automation features to help customers get the application performance that they need at a reasonable cost . <p> SW : Enterprises and channel partners alike may presume SD-WAN reduces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners . While policy-based abstraction does reduce repetitive , low-level configuration tasks and misconfigurations , it refocuses efforts on optimizing network architectures . Both enterprises and their channel partners benefit from this shift to more value-added services and greater agility to achieve business objectives . Networks can be re-architected to accommodate the shift to cloud applications and data centers , as well as the more efficient distribution of services . An SD-WAN solution can provide multi-tier orchestration with enterprise accessible portals for direct configuration and monitoring as well as managed provider portals for outsourced remote monitoring and management. ad 193521 @qwx393521

Wooden was known for motivating and mentoring his players on the court and off . His " 12 Lessons in Leadership " are equally applicable to success at the backboard or in the boardroom . <p> 1 . Good values attract good people . <p> To build a strong team , you need to demonstrate a value system that will enable you to attract the kind of people you want . Wooden stressed the think you are . " - He also noted that " Winning takes talent ; to repeat takes character . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . <p> Wooden believed that " The most important word in our language is love . The second is balance " keeping things in perspective . " Whether players or 193520 @qwx393520 <p> partners , team members must be valued and appreciated . " I worry that business leaders are more interested in material gain than they are in having the patience to build up a strong organization , and a strong organization starts with caring for their people , " he said . <p> 3 . Call yourself a teacher . <p> You do n't  have to be a manager or a mentor to serve as an example to those with whom you deal professionally " and personally . " Your energy and enjoyment , drive and dedication will stimulate and greatly inspire others , " advised Wooden . He was a teacher before he was a coach , and that greatly influenced the way in which he worked with his teams . He taught his players the basics and stressed that there were no shortcuts . " Success travels in the company of very hard work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no easy way . " <p> 4 . Emotion is your enemy . <p> Keep focused on the task at hand and giving it your best effort ; do n't  let reactions interfere with actions . Be objective and do n't  distract yourself " and certainly not with self-doubts about whether or not you 're up to the task . Do n't let what you can not do , interfere with what you can do , " stated Wooden . <p> 5 . It takes 10 hands to make a basket . <p> " The main ingredient of stardom is the rest of the team , " Wooden said . In sports or in business , it takes teamwork . All contributions to the effort should be acknowledged and appreciated . " A player who makes a team great is more valuable than a great player , " he observed . <p> 6 .

The carrot is mightier than a stick . <p> No one ever learns much from criticism except to hate criticism . " Young people need models , not 193520 @qwx393520 <p> critics , " Wooden observed . The best coaches and managers know how to motivate positively , by building up rather than tearing down . " A coach is someone who can give correction without causing resentment , " he said . <p> 9 . Make greatness attainable by all . <p> Wooden believed that a persons greatness was measured by how close they came to reaching their full potential .

Keep your mind in the game and let the results take care of themselves . I wanted the score of a game to be a by-product of these other things , and not the end itself , " said Wooden , who believed that personal integrity and character counted above all else .

In his new role , he will drive the company 's global sales and channel strategy , helping the company continue to expand its footprint in IT operations and networking , as well as break out in the IT security market . <p> ExtraHops Chris Lehman <p> In addition to FireEye , his career includes global sales , sales engineering and channel leadership positions at companies including EMC and Salesforce . <p> Last month , ExtraHop announced new professional services for cloud migration , data-center migration and microsegmentation . <p> In a Q&amp;A with Channel Partners , Lehman talks about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he plans to accomplish in his new role this year . <p> Channel Partners : How is your new job different from your previous job with FireEye ? <p> Chris Lehman : It 's really just different in terms of the scope . So at FireEye , I ran the Americas enterprise and commercial sales organizations , as well as a renewals team . At ExtraHop , I 've got the global organization " so global field operations and sales , as compared to FireEye , which was just specific to the Americas region . <p> CP : How do you plan to help ExtraHop expand its footprint in IT operations and networking ? <p> CL : What I would tell you is that historically the primary use cases for ExtraHop have really played more in the network-performance and application-performance management and diagnostic space , as well as IT operations and analytics . So that absolutely has been a big focus of ours historically and we see the opportunity to expand into cybersecurity . The interesting thing is that this was really not something that we set out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were doing already with ExtraHop . The analytics capabilities and the ability that we provide them to basically understand what 's going on inside of their network in real time by analyzing wire data is the perfect use case for that , for detecting anomalous behavior inside of a network , inside of the perimeter for cybersecurity purposes . So what we realized - is either 50 percent or 60 percent of our existing customers are already using ExtraHop in a cybersecurity context , and when the company saw this and realized that , " Wow , our customer base is already using us for this , " and we looked at our breadth of capabilities and what we 're really good at , it just matched up really well with the cybersecurity use case . <p> I do n't want to speak for our CEO , but what he 's told me is one of the big attractions or appeal of bringing me on board was going to be my cybersecurity background and knowledge , and that I could help guide the company further into cybersecurity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities . <p> CP : What sort of challenges does breaking out in the IT security market pose ? <p> CL : Anytime a company expands into a new category or makes an explicit push into a new category , a big part of making that successful is how we market and position ourselves . We 're a platform and we always historically positioned ourselves as a platform . And the language that you use as a platform provider can sometimes be a little bit more broad , a little bit more generic than when you are a purpose-built solution . <p> A big part of how we 'll break into and create more momentum in cybersecurity is going to be the language that we use , how we market ourselves and to show that we 're not just a platform , that we are a purpose-built solution for certain cybersecurity use cases . So when we go into a customer , we 're not just talking about generic IT analytics ; we 're talking specifically about our machine-learning capabilities and our ability to detect anomalous east-west traffic that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the context of cybersecurity detection and response . <p> In large part the technology is already there , and we built out and added some additional capabilities , when we introduced Addy , which is our machine learning technology we 're going to continue to expand on that in these bundles that we 're using as a company and these bundles will take our platform to a more purpose-built place for certain use cases , with cybersecurity being one of them . <p> CL : We have more than 200 reseller partners today , and my experience is that channel partners are looking for two things . No. 1 is you break your partnerships into two categories : You have your technology partners and then you have your VARs . And on the technology partner side , there are a lot of great synergies that ExtraHop has with other companies there are a lot of different companies that we can work with from a technology-partnership standpoint where we fill gaps and holes in their technology stack , and we do n't really see any competitive elements . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> From a VAR standpoint , my experience is the VARs really want two things . They want predictability and the ability to earn very strong gross margin profits . And a big part of the successful channel strategy is creating and providing that predictability of how they work with ExtraHop , what specific solutions can they go out and position to their customers , how can we insert ExtraHop into their reference architectures and solution playbooks so that their salespeople can know exactly when to use ExtraHop , the problem that we solve , what makes us different/better than the competition , and they can do that in a high-velocity , very repeatable way . <p> So we want to create this predictability in terms of the solutions that they can use ExtraHop for , No. 1 , and then predictability in terms of how we engage with them , and there are lots of different ways that you can engage with a channel partner . In some instances , it 's when they bring us into the opportunity , and in other instances we may be bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure they have a very clear sense of what their gross margin opportunity is regardless of how we 're engaging with one another . So if we can create that predictability , we can give them certainty on the amount of gross margin that they can earn " and oh , by the way , make very rich and profitable margins " then we can be a very attractive partner for them . <p> CP : What do you plan to accomplish in your first six months to a year in this position ? <p> CL : For me , the first six months is all about laying the foundation to help the productivity and growth of ExtraHop . And a big part of creating a productive , leveraged sales organization is in your partner strategy . So it 's laying the foundation on the rules of engagement that we use and follow when engaging with partners . It 's outlining and creating those clear expectations with the gross margins and solutions that we partner with . So a big part of my first six months is focusing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's making sure that our marketing message and our go-to-market selling motion is well defined and understood inside of the sales organization . And by focusing on the productivity of our sales organization , it 's going to put us in a position in another six months to really start to expand our sales organization , expand the number of sellers that we have , expand the number of partners that we work with , so that we can really start to accelerate our growth rate . We 're already a high-growth company , but we see an opportunity to really accelerate the growth even further . <p> CP : What sort of feedback have you begun receiving from partners ? What are they telling you ? Are there things they like and do n't like ? <p> CL : It 's early on , but the feedback I 've gotten is the channel community sees the power of ExtraHop and they see the power of our technology , and they see the ability to make strong gross margins and help their customers . So we think in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 're really poised to do a lot more and accelerate with the channel . But I think the channel is looking for greater predictability and greater certainty around the gross margins that they can receive from us , and they want to make sure they 're attractive and rich . So the good news is those are pretty easy things to clarify and work on and can really help drive further engagement and acceleration with the channel . But they 're very excited about ExtraHop and what we can do together . <p> CP : How do you think ExtraHop 's channel strategy and partner program will look in three to five years ? <p> CL : I hope it 's just bigger and better . We 'll continue to refine what we do , but we want to continue to expand on the breadth of it . One of our big goals and objectives it to get more leverage in our selling model . And we all know that the best way to create leverage in technology sales is through the channel . So I envision a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market for us , where they could own the SMB and midmarket segments for ExtraHop , where our salespeople are more focused on kind of the very high end of the market . And even in the high end of the market , we would continue to partner with the channel , but I hope to get to the point where they are a completely integral part of our distribution strategy and give us the leverage that we need to become a $500 million-$1 billion in revenue company . 193521 @qwx393521

In Europe , especially , customers are scrambling to prepare for implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) that goes into effect in May 2018 . This focus on GDPR compliance is confirmed by a recent PwC pulse survey that found more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top privacy and data security priority , and that 77 percent have dedicated at least $1 million toward achieving compliance before the deadline . <p> Another striking finding : Thirty-two percent of respondents plan to reduce their presence in Europe , while 26 percent intend to exit the EU market altogether . Talk about an opportunity for partners that can make sense of the EU regulatory morass . <p> In 2017 , the emphasis for data privacy and information security is likely to be on tackling complexity , not just of threats but of the compliance landscape . Overseas trade is too important to walk away from . That 's true despite the growing uncertainty that has prevailed since European privacy advocates signaled their dissatisfaction with the Privacy Shield data-sharing trade framework that went into effect in October . <p> What 's their complaint ? As with the original cross-border data sharing agreement , Safe Harbor , many in Europe remain concerned that U.S. practices are inadequate for meeting EU privacy standards . The Article 29 Working Party ( Europes governing body of privacy authorities ) has given Privacy Shield a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges . However , expected changes to U.S. privacy policy under the new Trump administration increase the likelihood that Privacy Shield will be vacated , like Safe Harbor before it . <p> That even though the regulation gives EU citizens broad protections that could cost customers a significant amount of time and money in case of a dispute . <p> Compliance &amp; Verticals : Selling and securing industry-specific solutions make you more profitable and can be an important differentiator above even technical prowess , according to Techaisle . Ready to go vertical ? Get the free report now ! <p> Here at home , compliance with less exotic but equally important regulations is also a major driver of information security investments . <p> In the medical community , youve probably heard of HIPAA , but are you up on the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ( HITECH ) of 2009 ? Financial customers including banks , tax preparation services , loan originators , mortgage lenders , consumer credit organizations and others are required to set and maintain strict privacy and data security programs under the 1999 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Payment Card Industry Digital Security Standard ( PCI DSS ) may not be law , but it is the prevailing standard of protection and one that many states refer to as evidence that a customer tried in good faith to protect customer privacy in the event of a data breach . <p> Compliance is a bewildering patchwork of laws and standards that often seem to be in conflict with each other . That confusion means that a highly personalized , consultative approach to addressing the customers unique situation is necessary even at a time when the trend seems to be substituting technology for human interaction . Yes , there are tools that can make implementation of a solution easier for all involved , but they are a complement to a hands-on consultative engagement , not a replacement . <p> My main advice is , never meet complexity with more complexity . That 's a sure way for customers to end up less secure and compliant because when a process or technology is difficult to understand and use , your customers employees will find workarounds . That will likely compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliance solution that is robust enough to exceed regulatory standards , convenient for the user , with clear productivity and usability benefits for the CFO , and easy to implement and manage for those tasked with maintaining policy and compliance . I recommend offering education and training services tailored to the individual roles involved with meeting customer security and compliance goals , but also try to foster a sense of shared responsibility in my experience , that will result in an increase in overall security posture . Do this and you 're in a great position to help both customers and your bottom line . <p> Peter Merkulov is vice president of product strategy and technology alliances at Globalscape. 193521 @qwx393521

@@37500406 @6500406/ 193519 @qwx393519 <h> blog <p> Microsoft this week officially released its Teams chat-based workspace for Office 365 . This is a direct challenge to Slack , but also Cisco , Google , Facebook and Amazon , all of which are making moves in the crowded enterprise messaging market . <p> Channel partners need to have a plan , because business customers are quickly migrating away from standalone tools toward unified communication ( UC ) platforms , a market GrandView Research projects will be worth $143.5 billion by 2024 . Well-known brands like Microsoft , Cisco and Google are angling to capture as much of this growth as possible , with your help , and each brings a very different approach and set of offerings to the UC space . Over the last year , both Cisco and Microsoft have pushed to integrate their UC solutions with other services , while Google is carving out a new market by retooling their Hangouts app for enterprise use . <p> While the features and capabilities in Cisco Spark , Microsoft Office 365 E5 and Google Hangouts are slowly converging , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctions remain between each vendors offerings and industry , workflow and workplace culture will ultimately inform a customers UC platform choice . <p> Employee familiarity with UC solutions : Training employees and ensuring they regularly use the UC platform are critical to customer ROI . Skype for Business and Hangouts already enjoy widespread recognition due to their presence in the consumer market , reducing training hurdles and mitigating end users resistance to adoption . Shadow IT in the UC space is significantly less likely when employees officially sanctioned tools are the same as those they choose to use personally . <p> However , Hangouts transition to the corporate space may introduce new challenges . When Microsoft transitioned Lync to Skype for Business , the brand immediately became more recognizable and appealing to end users . In the same way , Hangouts pivot away from the consumer space may sacrifice the benefits of employee familiarity for more dedicated support . On the plus side , at its Next Conference , Google affirmed its commitment to the channel . <p> Cisco Spark , lacking a consumer-facing counterpart , will likely be less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full adoption . <p> Integration with existing systems : Google , Cisco and Microsoft take different approaches to UC integration , resulting in varying levels of cross-platform compatibility . Hangouts currently struggles with poor integration across nontraditional devices ( like connected whiteboards ) , as well as a lack of general integration outside of a few enterprise apps like Slack . Microsofts UC environment is similarly gated , delivering ample integration within Microsoft applications and devices , but little outside the vendors ecosystem . While this may be sufficient for small and midsize businesses that rely exclusively on G Suite and Office 365 , many larger organizations will need to seek third-party integration support or turn to Cisco . <p> Spark currently stands as the most flexible UC platform , offering on-premises capabilities as well as support for a varied range of devices , such as room systems . Especially for industries with specific security , privacy or other needs such as e-discovery capabilities Ciscos platform offers a less restrictive approach . Even still , Microsofts UC offering remains competitive , particularly for those already in the Redmond ecosystem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ciscos more traditional focus on messaging , voice and video . The new Team offering will help cement that . <p> Platform maturity and features : Microsoft and Cisco have competed in the UC space for years , while Google is a relatively recent entrant . As such , its not surprising that Hangouts is missing features , such as scheduled meetings and enterprise security , which have long been considered standard among its competitors . At the same time , however , Googles modern approach to enterprise communication , rooted in the same focus on simplicity that attracted millennials to consumer-oriented apps like Snapchat and Skype , may better appeal to younger workers . <p> On the other hand , Skype for Business and Spark have had more time to mature to the needs of the enterprise market , and are better designed to support business use . While Ciscos offering provides broad compatibility across devices and support for on-premises use cases , Microsoft tempts many companies already within its enterprise application ecosystem to add UC services to their existing subscriptions . <p> As these platforms grow , expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basics , Google will likely attempt to replicate Microsofts tightly integrated bundle of collaboration applications . Similarly , Microsoft could benefit by walking in Ciscos footsteps and opening Skype for Business to allow for better external integrations , while Cisco could learn from Googles focus on simplicity for end users . <p> Almost every customer has struggled with a subpar meeting experience , whether from poor platform interconnection or collaboration tools unable to meet employees needs . Cisco , Microsoft and Google offer different solutions to the challenges of meeting and conferencing , each rooted in their own strengths and background .

Even the CIA ca n't keep its most sensitive data out of the hands of WikiLeaks . And while IT teams and security officers are consumed by this news , executive , compliance and legal teams are also paying attention due to the business-wide repercussions of an attack , from productivity and revenue losses to business process failures . <p> While each company will have its own specific needs around a security plan , on a high level , there steps organizations can take now to minimize risk , protect data from potential future attacks and be prepared to respond fast . <p> Have a Go Bag <p> Organizations of all sizes need to understand the challenges they could face immediately after an attack : <p> Challenge : Incomplete or inadequate response plans <p> There are many potential attack scenarios . Customers need to identify the ones most likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer data . Only then can they put in place first-response plans , from technology , data and communication standpoints , for getting the business back up and running . <p> Challenge : Lack of funding to properly execute response and recovery <p> Even if customers know what they should do , they may not have the budget necessary to bounce back . The 2016 Ponemon Cost of a Breach study shows the average total cost per record breached is $158 , but healthcare records are higher , at $355 . Partners can help with a fiscal reality check . One way to prepare is to have cybersecurity insurance to help with notifications , first- and third-party damages , and lost income . <p> Challenge : Lack of a communications plan , both internally and externally : Organizations should formulate in advance a detailed plan to communicate swiftly with employees , partners and customers , including but not limited to notifications required by law . <p> Challenge : Inability to properly recover lost or damaged data <p> Malicious attackers can steal , update or delete data , hold it ransom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get that information back to continue moving the business forward . Its often a mix of isolated backups and having a bitcoin wallet ready . <p> Challenge : Can not meet defined recovery-time and -point objectives : Organizations with defined RTO and RPO metrics in place must prepare across a variety of scenarios to get data back in the right format in the specified timeframe . <p> Once the immediate crisis has passed , customers need to evaluate their security postures using the " protect , detect , respond , recover " method : <p> Protect : Across all endpoints , from sensors to the data center , organizations must put preventative controls in place to ensure that the right people ( and no one else ) have the right access to the right data . From a data security perspective , organizations need to also understand what information they have and how important it is data classification so that the right controls are put around it . Leveraging protective technology is critical as well , taking into account both internal and external threats . Lastly , security awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyones job . <p> Detect : Organizations should have behavioral monitoring , detection and machine learning technology that can flag attacks or internal or external behaviors indicative of a threat to data or technology . With continuous monitoring for anomalies and events , organizations increase their ability to quickly detect an attack and then take appropriate actions . Considering that 69 percent of organizations learn about breaches from an outside entity such as law enforcement , according to the M-Trends 2015 : A View from the Front Lines Report , customers could be doing much more to improve their detection capabilities . <p> Respond : Per the Verizon 2015 Data Breach Investigations Report , in 60 percent of cases , attackers can compromise an organization within minutes , underscoring the critical importance of closing the gap between discovery and action . As discussed , customers need to have a clear plan in place so that when an attack occurs , they can properly respond and get the business back up and running swiftly .

Whether data is stored on-premises or in the cloud , organizations must run drills to ensure that they can restore access to data quickly and efficiently . <p> Longer term , customers must follow these keys to success : <p> Take advantage of technology advances . The software , networks and computing devices that provide core business functions often include built-in security , such as encryption and access controls . Ensure that those functions are turned on and that employees are n't  bypassing them . <p> Develop and document a long-term response-and-recovery plan . While customers need to understand in advance what they will do in the aftermath of an attack , beyond eliminating holes that gave the attacker access or removing ransomware , they must also consider longer-term legal ramifications and responsibilities and keep the plan updated as the business grows and changes . <p> Build a culture of security . Organizations need to establish security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules of behavior for how to handle and protect customer information and other vital data . Security is everyones job , so the people aspect of it needs to be considered , as well as the IT aspect . <p> As customers become ready to go deeper , consider the guidance within the NIST Cybersecurity Framework , which was drafted by the Commerce Departments National Institute of Standards and Technology .

The decryption and encryption process takes a fair amount of computational overhead , depending the strength of the encryption . Processing these tasks on a machine that is also doing many other functions can create bottlenecks and reduce the availability of networking services . <p> My company , IT solutions provider Data Endure , works with some top security providers , including Symantec . While most notable as a market leader in personal and enterprise antivirus products , AV is not the only game Symantec plays . Over the years it has continued to grow its pool of technologies via internal development and acquisitions . Today , the company offers other useful protections against more advanced threats , including email and advanced security challenges . <p> Symantec recently acquired Blue Coat , which brings us to the conversation of hardware and software solutions that are mainly geared to manage encrypted traffic . Blue Coat was a market leader in the arena of SSL decryption and built a great business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of firewalls that do SSL interception and inspection of encrypted traffic , I 'll use the Symantec/Blue Coat product set as my example of what to look for , because we partner with them . <p> Symantecs flagship product , Proxy SG , sits as a decryption proxy in the customer environment , comes packed with useful features and is deployable in both on-premises and cloud models . You can tune intelligent policy decisions for customers based on reputation , whitelist and blacklist methodologies so that you are selectively decrypting , blocking or allowing traffic while at the same time protecting your customers privacy . For example , say the company allows end users to log in to their online banking applications while in the office ; you could set the proxy to pass that through traffic untouched . <p> The acquisition of Blue Coat is also expanding Symantecs coverage in the realms of reputation-based decisions , updates and automatic tuning of the system . <p> Symantecs Global Intelligence Network , always a bit of secret sauce for partners , is a global array of sensors that feed threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information is then tapped into by a few of Symantecs core products . Blue Coats integration into Symantecs Global Intelligence Network will be a win-win on both technology fronts . ( A look at the combined Symantec Secure One and Blue Coat partner program is here . ) <p> Its important to remember that integrating a technology such as this into a customer network should not be done lightly . Come prepared , and get some outside help if you need it . There is a good amount tuning required , not to mention focused conversations on what the companys decryption policy is going to be . But one thing is for sure : Its time to talk to customers about the dark side of encryption . <p> Corey Wilburn is the security practice manager at DataEndure , where he specializes in the design of strategic solutions , aimed at delivering high-value operational intelligence , leveraging best-in-class products as well as services built around current and emerging standards . 193521 @qwx393521

In addition to technical safeguards , Azure offers a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement ( BAA ) in which Microsoft commits to adhere to certain security and privacy provisions set forth in HIPAA and the HITECH Act . <p> The openness of the platform was appealing too . Because Microsoft Azure easily integrates with various development platforms , GE Healthcare could continue working with its existing tools , including Java code and a messaging system . Management would be easier and more affordable as well because Microsoft handles service operations and platform-related updates . The company also knew it would benefit from the Azure teams high level of support and architectural expertise , which it would need to bring its solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a proof of concept for transitioning apps that were running in a production environment on premises to Microsoft Azure . The transition was seamless using Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines ( VMs ) .

NET on Microsoft Azure VMs provide full compatibility with on-premises infrastructure . In addition , the SQL Server AlwaysOn feature ensures high availability. ad <p> The project soon extended to multiple applications ; some that were in production and some new . When GE Healthcare saw what Microsoft Azure could do in the proof of concept , it understood the value it could bring to multiple health-care scenarios . <p> CP : Is there profit to be made from developing custom services .

" <p> Stark likened the process " in Iowa-fashion " to farming . <p> We feel like it 's easier to sell current clients more stuff , more products , than it is to go out and acquire new . We still work on getting new clients , but we really work on managing our current base and selling them solutions that they need to help their business , " he said . <p> Stark will share some of his digital transformation lessons at the upcoming Channel Partners Conference and Expo , where he will participate in a panel with WTGs Vince Bradley , Liquid Networxs Don Douglas and Aclivitis Ryan Young. ad <p> Stark says both the cloud and channel landscape will be affected by M&amp;A . Carrier Access historically has been- selective with cloud providers because of the volatility . <p> Cloud was kind of the new shiny toy that everybody wanted , " he said . And the next thing you know , they 're out of business or something happened , and we 've got clients at risk . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year is unlikely- to continue at its current pace . <p> I think the M&amp;A will always be there , from what I would call large enterprise to **45;115;TOOLONG standpoint , but I think from the Big 3 ' per se " AT&amp;T , Verizon and CenturyLink " I think they 'll continue to 193520 @qwx393520 <p> pick up some smaller stuff here and there to help round out their products and things , but there 's not really a whole lot of consolidation left , " he said . <p> Stark began his career with McLeod USA in 1996 . He worked in provisioning , moved into executive escalations and eventually rose to director of consumer sales . <p> He switched to Carrier Access in 2004 . He said the company had eight employees at the time , compared to the 80-some it has now . There he has served as a director of operations and director of IT . He says he experienced a major life lesson when he chose to step down from running the company 's managed IT service practice . A guy who describes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told his CEO that the company needed someone with more technological breadth in the role. ad <p> Early in your career you want to do everything . You want to make everyone happy . You want to do those things . But later I realized sometimes it's- OK to say , You know what , I 'm not the best person for this . ' " <p> Stark says he fits better doing vendor relations , a job that teaches the importance of maintaining relationships in the channel . <p> If I could give someone in the channel advice , it is : Talk to people , learn from people , be nice to everyone , " he said . Because the channel " although it 's a large community , it 's a very small community " and you do n't know when you might burn a bridge with Carrier A , the leader of that channel program may be at Carrier B , who might be your biggest person later . I 've seen it happen . " 193521 @qwx393521

Fortinet , IBM Security , Check Point Software and Zscaler are among the initial participants . <p> Channel Partners spoke to Mike Wood , VeloClouds vice president of marketing , to get his insight on his companys security strategy and the activities in the SD-WAN industry . <p> The Q&amp;A transcript has been edited for length and clarity . <p> Channel Partners : This has been a project that was in the works for a long time . What kind of feedback led to this program ? <p> Mike Wood : On the API side , the feedback we were getting early on was very positive in terms of , " Hey , you 've got this full suite of APIs . Anything that you can do on your own orchestrator , we can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and MetTel and a few others have designed against this . Part of that feedback was , " It would be nice if there were packages that we could leverage instead of having to go through and decipher the entire API and sift through that . " It was through that feedback that we created the SDK software development kit , to be honest . Having many APIs is great , but the SDK gives these modules that these vendors and channel partners can use to develop that was one piece of feedback. ad <p> Another piece on the VNF side is that I would say there probably is n't a security vendor out there that is n't talking about or at least has a road map for getting to a VNF . Some of the feedback that we got early on from the folks that we 've been working with is there are a couple of different models that they would like to be able to entertain . One model is where they run with our environments and our framework . But also most of them would like to have a model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framework as a VNF . That was something that we definitely needed and worked to create an extensible framework that could be applied not just to our environment but also to other environments , in addition to the ability to port this to third-party virtual CPEs . Its no secret Juniper has their own virtual CPE model , and AT&amp;T is at least in part standardizing on that . Were running on the FlexWare model for AT&amp;T , so therefore we must be running within that Juniper framework , so that 's a good example of that . <p> On the cloud side , one of the drivers there has been , Zscaler and VeloCloud , for example , both work very closely with AT&amp;T . And AT&amp;T one of the drivers for them was seamless integration of the two solutions and offers to the point where ideally within their dashboard , you can go in and activate SD-WAN and light up secure web gateway services , and it will look like a single solution from one vendor . That was another piece that we really had to focus on ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> CP : Could you take me through some of the main concerns that surround security as far as it pertains to SD-WAN ? <p> MW : One concern is the idea of protecting data , and having the ability to selectively decide whether or not data should be encrypted or not . That 's been one of the concerns that surfaces . For example , in a hybrid model , businesses are sometimes still comfortable with the level of security that 's available with MPLS . Even though there 's no encryption that happens with MPLS and MPLS is considered to be a VPN , businesses oftentimes will decide they do n't  necessarily want to encrypt the data that goes across MPLS , but they do want to encrypt the data that goes across the public Internet . The second issue around security in SD-WAN has been the idea that SD-WAN has got phenomenal , compelling value propositions to IT and to the business ( decreasing the cost , decreasing the complexity , leveraging broadband Internet as a reliable transport option and interfacing and taking that control of cloud services and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is already a security profile , if you will , where the SecOps team has gone in and already done an extensive amount of work on what the security profile needs to look like for the business . Oftentimes when you go into these environments , you discover that you can have the greatest SD-WAN solution in the world , but if it does n't  have the ability to marry with the existing security profile that the business has with limited or few changes , it becomes very difficult for the IT network operations team to move forward and have SD-WAN implemented . <p> In addition to that , oftentimes we 've seen there 's a tendency for the SecOps team to standardize on certain vendors or certain products or certain attributes . Universal threat management might be Fortinet and data-leak protection might be another vendor altogether , and they also want to use secure web gateway from , maybe , Zscaler . Oftentimes , there 's a mixed , best-of-breed model that they using to deliver that , and theyve chosen specific vendors , because of specific capabilities or requirements. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ciscos acquisition of Viptela . What trends does that signal , and where does VeloCloud fit into those trends ? <p> MW : As recognized by industry analysts , VeloCloud is the market leader by number of revenue-paying customers in the SD-WAN market because of our unique architecture and success with both enterprise and service-provider customers . We continue to grow strongly and remain independent by choice in a market that is expected to reach $6 billion in three years . <p> In the short-term , this acquisition will create a market opportunity for VeloCloud and our service provider and channel partners as Cisco sorts out three competing product lines and five unique management systems . In the long term , we firmly believe that our architecture , our business model which enables the " unboxing " of the network , and the movement of on-premises functions to the cloud will prevail . 193521 @qwx393521

And with a record attendance of more than 43,000 , RSAC 2017 was no exception . ( See my top seven startups here . ) <p> The cybersecurity trends that stood out this year were cloud and container security , machine learning , securing the Internet of things , rugged DevOps and the growing managed security services market . Let 's look at a few of these . <p> AI and Machine Learning : About three-fourths of the vendors on the expo floor touted some level of artificial intelligence or machine-learning capabilities . Currently , however , most of the machine-learning capabilities discussed are just like the Bayesian techniques in spam filters and heuristics commonly found in anti-malware software but now , new and improved ! <p> Bottom line , much of the talk around AI and machine learning is currently more hype than reality , which makes it difficult for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's marketing. ad <p> Cloud On Track : In contrast , when it comes to cloud , things have hit a tipping point . According to a report published by cloud access security broker Skyhigh Networks and the Cloud Security Alliance , titled " Custom Applications and IaaS Report 2017 , " the use of cloud in the enterprise has hit an all-time high , and the use of custom apps is growing rapidly . According to the report , enterprises typically run 464 custom applications ; yet , information security teams are aware of only 38.4 percent of those apps . Enterprises need partners that can help them identify and effectively manage this shadow IT that is growing in their organizations . <p> What 's more , use of software as a service is growing 10 times as rapidly as traditional IT , and infrastructure as a service is growing at twice that rate . According to the Skyhigh Networks and CSA report , this year , for the first time , **27;189;TOOLONG providers will host more custom applications than are held in corporate data centers . <p> Current projections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match the survey results .

One such case : An ambulance carrying a patient to the hospital was diverted to another location because the intended hospital had fallen prey to a ransomware infection and was unable to accept incoming patients in the emergency room . <p> " Youre in an ambulance , probably the most terrifying moment in your life . Seconds matter and you have to be directed somewhere else , even if its just three blocks up the street how is that acceptable ?

For 32 percent of enterprises , its taking six months or more to fill those positions . <p> When considering the steep challenges that enterprises face in finding the security professionals they need , coupled with the rapid adoption of cloud , mobile and now IoT , its no wonder that security services continue expanding so rapidly . A report recently published by Allied Market Research estimates that the global managed security services market will grow at a 16.6 percent annual clip between now and 2022 . <p> And there 's a good chance that five years from now , RSA conference attendees will be discussing not how these challenges were solved , but how they grew in complexity . <h> One comment <p> If organizations are finding it difficult to fill positions , why are they so reluctant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

In the future , we may see disputes over these assets decided in transnational digital arbitration in virtual jurisdictions like BitNation , a " virtual nation " that provides nation-state services via the blockchain . These services are enjoying exponential growth . <p> Advisers serving the legal and financial verticals should be paying attention now . The legal industry , specifically trust and estate planning , is on the brink of a radical shift . <p> In its first conceptualization , the blockchain was merely a device to determine ownership of arbitrary units , known as bitcoins , within its own ledger at any given time . Encrypted addresses within the system either hold a number of units or remain empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , immutable platform to record the ownership of digital property . Rather than tracking ownership on a single individuals laptop or a corporate back-end server , the blockchain system is entirely new . It allows anyone to watch transactions in plain view but requires a 51 percent consensus of " users " to make edits to the global digital " spreadsheet . " Ownership and transaction data is replicated across every computer in the network and observed , stored and distributed by an unlimited number of competing peers simultaneously , each verifying and fact-checking its rivals and correcting any rogue attempts to cheat the system . <p> In short , the network gains value with every peer vigilante ( bitcoin miner ) that joins . Notably , the user base of blockchain technologys first implementation , bitcoin , has grown to create the most powerful and secure distributed supercomputer in the world . Venture capitalists are taking the next step to build on the concept of blockchain " property , " assigning real-life values to the tokens stored . Rather than floating as cybercurrency , some entrepreneurs have connected coin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold or shares of ownership in a company , allowing this second-level implementation to function like floating securities on a decentralized exchange . An example of this " side chain " function that represents real-life assets is Colored Coins , an open-source protocol for creating digital assets . <p> While Colored Coins and similar implementations of tangible assets may be interesting fodder for securities lawyers , and provide a way for the banking system to curb transaction costs , these are far from a watershed techs for most people . <p> What is a seismic application for businesses and the legal field is the ability to affix conditions for future transfer on blockchain coins , resulting in what are referred to as " smart contracts . " Smart contracts will substantially lower the costs of trust instruments traditionally drafted by lawyers . In fact , the cost savings and increased efficiency allow for new uses of trusts once prohibited by cost . Partners serving the technical needs of legal firms should ensure clients understand the benefits and risks . <p> There are also links into Internet of Things projects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is typically contractually obligated to check for a condition and make payment to an account if that condition has occurred . The simplest of these conditions is time and date some beneficiaries receive a monthly or annual payment from a traditional trust . Because the blockchain system keeps an accurate and irreversible internal clock , it can administer a smart contract akin to a trust or escrow , with property under the watchful eyes of thousands of peers , until the predetermined moment of transfer is reached . Beneficiaries receiving periodic distributions would bypass the costs of a trustee . More technical applications for " securities " would allow for asset holders to program smart contracts that send value at a particular time , resulting in autonomous digital options , arbitrage , dividend payments and futures contracts . <p> These conditional smart contracts function like " macros " on a blockchains spreadsheet . You could help legal clients exponentially decrease costs in the world of trust and estate planning by harnessing this tool . <p> Beyond cutting administrative costs , smart contracts make a number of futuristic applications for trusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other technologies in the Internet of Things space . Implanted sensors or databases , referred to as " oracles , " could serve as sources of information for smart contracts , which would continuously monitor to see if a set condition exists to transfer the property , automatically executing this transfer at that exact moment . <p> One could easily imagine connecting wearable technology into a smart-contracts trust fund , where meeting exercise or health goals will trigger a distribution . An individual might reward a child for completing various chores , doing homework or quitting smoking . Suppose a user wants to create a trust for a child , but wants the funds to be distributed only if the child graduates from college and continued to stay fit while away from home . The smart-contract trust could automatically query the universitys academic records to see if the child graduated , simultaneously checking a Fitbit-type implant to see if the child reached exercise goals . Once the goals were met , the funds would be distributed automatically and economically . <p> In contrast , trusts in use today remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affordably . Money and time spent on human trustees in their administration of a trust can be exorbitant . Nowhere is this problem more present than preparing assets for death . <p> With few exceptions , death leads to the most certain and important administration of a trust in the cycle of life . But dying is expensive . Retaining counsel to draft a proper will is only the beginning . Assets must typically be probated , a lengthy process where an attorney , an executor and a judge all spend time and money , with the amount of both increasing with the size of the estate . Sibling rivalries can devolve into years-long battles over the true intent of the deceased . Smart contracts and trusts offer a solution in cost savings and clarity by automatically distributing the estate and transferring deeds within moments of the decedents last breath . <p> There are a number of advantages that a legal firm could pass on to clients once a partner sets up the process of generating smart contracts . No executor , trustee or judge is required , so human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue . Computers always do what they are told , so the smart contract will follow the wishes of grantor exactly as instructed . Costs are shifted toward the front end of trust and estate planning , rather than in the execution phase , resulting in cost predictability and savings . <p> As with the development of any new legal instrument , use of the blockchain will evolve from its current nascent stage into a complex tool for lawyers to build conditioned transfers of assets at a fraction of the present-day cost . With lawyers typically slow to embrace technology , the question remaining is what type of business model will master the implementation of Smart Contracts and Trusts , and who will be the pioneer that transforms the legal landscape . While there are a number examples of startups and distributed autonomous organizations creating smart contracts Factom , Ethereum , and the previously mentioned BitNation come to mind none of these has been adopted widely by the legal industry . Time will tell which blockchain implementation will gain traction in the legal marketplace . <p> Mick Erlandson is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a multinational company .

But despite the flow of investment dollars and what seem to be an endless list of security providers , underlying problems in the industry from the skills gap to the constant launch of half-baked IT projects and technology are making it difficult to keep networks secure . <p> As a result , companies are doubling down on their security spending . Some are adding more solutions or providing additional training for on-staff IT pros . Others are taking a step back and rethinking their entire network infrastructure . <p> But it seems there is yet to be a widely adopted way to secure organizations without losing pace or spreading resources thin .

Fueling a lot of the market growth are partnerships between MSSPs and security players like Palo Alto Networks , value-added resellers and system integrators , as well as international telco providers such as Singtel , Optus and Rogers Communications , which are now offering managed security services .

The first thing that struck me is the observation that Avayas owners are having difficulty meeting the debt payments that they incurred to purchase the company . If you recall , Avaya was purchased by Silver Lake and TPG Capital for $8.3 billion in 2007 . The intent was to grow the company and take it public . Due to market changes and slipping performance , a public offering was abandoned . <p> Fast forward to today . The velocity of movement toward cloud-based PBX solutions by Avayas competitors , notably Cisco and Microsoft , has increased dramatically . While Avaya does offer IP-based PBXes in addition to hardware-based TDM , it has had limited success in the growing cloud PBX space . <p> Now Avayas owners face two unpalatable alternatives : Declare bankruptcy or sell off parts or all of the company . <p> Let 's be clear : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positioning itself sooner with a cloud PBX solution . Avaya announced its move to IP PBXes and eventually to the cloud with some fanfare . But it remained behind Cisco , Microsoft , BroadSoft and others in terms of both a strong cloud PBX vision and the commitment to make what products it did have successful . <p> Avaya had 22 percent share of the PBX market in 2010 , according to Eastern Management Group . That share had dropped to 17 percent by 2015 , says IHS Markit , in what is itself a shrinking market . Today , new TDM PBX sales and additive lines for existing TDM PBXes continue to drop , and the growth of the IP PBX is less than that of cloud PBXes . In fact , IHS says the global PBX market overall will have a CAGR of -0.1 percent through 2019 . <p> The reasons for the disparity in growth between PBXes and UCaaS mirror what 's driving customers to the cloud in myriad areas : cost , scale , future-proofed technology , features , OpEx , customization and more . Unified communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct business communications and collaboration . In fact , the global unified communications market will reach $143 billion by 2024 , says Grand View Research . Compare that with an anemic $6.9 billion in 2019 for PBXes , per IHS . <p> It is not surprising that Avaya was late to the cloud trend . As an incumbent equipment provider , it faced a difficult decision as to when it should begin to cannibalize its hardware sales and push as a top priority a software/cloud replacement . Its not the first to face such a fork in the road , nor the last to incorrectly time the switch . The transition to the cloud and cloud technologies is rapidly forcing both legacy hardware and software vendors to establish cloud strategies that can effectively maintain and grow their businesses . <p> Partners , you need to take a clear-eyed look at key providers and your own company .

Of course , the sales people involved will be high-fiving one another and raking in management congratulations . However , someone needs to be asking this million-dollar question : Was this sale based on true love or fleeting attraction ? By that I mean , can your business execute on the sales teams promises , at a consistently high level and over the long haul ? <p> That depends on a few factors . <p> First , do your sales people have short attention spans ? One challenge that many IT providers face is that the enthusiasm over a new sale can fade away in a flash . Often , sales and marketing people have " prospect fatigue " after having to maintain an intense focus on a potential customer , for some length of time , before they convert the sales lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision-makers inviting them to events , mixers , golfing , dinner , sending thank you cards , gift cards , gift baskets . <p> The point is , you might spend a lot of time and money romancing a prospect . Then , over time , that attention goes away , leaving the customer feeling neglected . <p> When that happens , you 're setting your business and the customer up for failure . <p> Remember : The opportunity to launch a relationship with a new business prospect often opens up as a direct result of the customers current MSPs lack of attention . That means , if you all-out razzle-dazzle prospects in the beginning but attention drops like a rock once the deal is signed , you have set the relationship up to fail . <p> I have seen plenty of customers that seem to be on a revolving track , where they get wooed away from one IT provider and run into the arms of a new MSP , which then proceeds to ignore them all over again . This causes them to just get lured away , over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because no one took the time to show some love on an ongoing basis . <h> You Never Call Me Anymore ! <p> Many entrepreneurs start up managed-services businesses or become cloud providers because of the potential for sticky customers and a recurring revenue stream . However , when you have a short-sighted customer-relationship management process , you are effectively sabotaging that potential . Failing to cultivate a steady , ongoing rapport with current customers means they are no longer sticky , and you thus ca n't guarantee a solid recurring revenue stream . You could start losing clients at any moment and could even see customer defections spike dramatically , which can trigger layoffs and ultimately cause your business to spiral completely out of business . <p> The answer is to set up a process that ensures a solid and consistent relationship with every customer after the sale is made . Of course , this process must entail more than just sending out a gift basket to your customers each year . In my next article , I will discuss the key factors to consider .

Very often it makes sense to outsource due to the requirement for specialized knowledge and the overall shortage in skilled personnel that can do the work . You need the resources but may not be able to attract and/or hire yourself . <p> Bill Gauthier : The growth of the public cloud , in addition to the shared responsibility matrix for security in the cloud , are significant drivers . Plus , with the cybersecurity skill gap having more than 2 million openings globally , organizations need help managing security because experts are difficult to recruit and retain. ad <p> Cameron Tousley : a ) Financial flexibility/increased cash flow for end-user customers : having a fixed monthly payment versus spending an entire yearly budget upfront is attractive for end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget to help grow their business all year long . <p> Also : b ) convenience ; and c ) expertise . <p> David Venable : Companies of all sizes are finding it hard to attract and retain security talent . Thats compounded by ever rising salaries . A managed security service let 's IT teams bolster their security posture with 24+7 human monitoring , the latest technologies to detect and defend corporate networks , and predictable operating expenses . Some managed services also work with the existing security solutions companies have in place such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems . <p> CP : How does a partner stand out in this increasingly competitive market ? <p> TG : As with any market , sellers that stay abreast of the latest trends and exploits , as well as how , , , 193520 @qwx393520 <p> these things impact the end-customers business , will be ahead of those that sell product features and functions only . <p> BG : To differentiate in this increasingly crowded space , partners need to demonstrate the capability to be a trusted , experienced adviser with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Department of Defense ) or other demanding fields . They must also show that they can deliver strong return on investment for customers who might try to take security in-house . Finally , there must be measurable outcomes on performance , such as positive metrics on dwell time , " which calculates the amount of time a network has been compromised . This number needs to remain small in terms of days before a threat is remediated . <p> CT : a ) Sell a complete solution : When putting together a managed services offering , offer a basic package , but also a more advanced and complete solution for customers who have additional IT/security needs . Offer basics like networking , web , email plus basic security ( firewall , spam filtering , antivirus ) , but also include a more advanced package that includes additional security layers like encryption , two-factor authentication , ( and ) periodic physical/digital security testing with employees to ensure the tools and end user education are present for a more holistic solution . <p> Also : b ) focus on a niche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage with clients consistently . <p> DV : A partner will stand out if they have developed some core competencies around managed security that allow them to speak with authority to customers and core prospects . They should also demonstrate an understanding of the unique security requirements of customers in particular vertical industries . For instance , health-care organizations have been besieged by a variety of multifaceted threats and are subject to specific government regulations around patient privacy . <p> CP : What are some of the top traits of successful MSP and reseller partners in this market ? <p> TG : Tenacity : understanding the long game , not trying to crush it in the first conversation and methodically keeping at it .

The market for cybersecurity is so complex ; you will not be able to be all things to all people . Carefully choose your target market and optimal solution to address it , and stick to it . You may be seduced by those asking you to make changes and add things to your services , but you cant do it all and do it all well .

And there are inherent costs to initiate and integrate solutions , which must be understood . Additionally , there is a drawback to treating every customer like a snowflake " rather than putting forth standardized processes and services that can be scaled appropriately without overinvesting with headcount , etc . <p> CT : a ) Not defining goals , customer targets and a business plan : Before you start down the road of launching an MSP practice , analyze and define ( on paper ) , what your business goals are , what business profile you will focus on ( and can be realistically effective in ) , what client size your business model and resources can accommodate , and devise a business plan that encapsulates all of this. ad <p> Also : b ) not developing awareness that all businesses are different ; c ) selling versus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . <p> DV : When formulating a managed security service , it 's important not to rely on a limited selection of security solutions like firewalls , intrusion detection systems or signature-based security systems . A behavioral-based security service will help block against new signatures that come in as opposed to a signature-based security system that will only block against a set of predetermined signatures . You need to consider your security coverage and sensors because you could have malware threats or insiders who are trying to harm the network . 193521 @qwx393521

" I think IoT is the next big opportunity for partners and they need to begin building a practice , but they need to do it wisely because the IoT domain is vast , " he added. ad <p> Here are some of the report findings on IoT initiatives by industry , use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey , 72 percent of companies have introduced IoT devices and sensors such as air conditioning and lighting systems ( 56 percent ) to personal mobile devices ( 51 percent ) into the workplace . <p> The leading IoT use case in the enterprise is indoor location-based services and also remote monitoring of utilities .

IoT devices are used as chemical sensors ( 62 percent ) and picking systems ( 46 percent ) . IoT plays a big role in monitoring and maintaining operating infrastructure , according to 31 percent of respondents . <p> In the industrial sector , IoT adoption is tied to increases in business efficiency ( 83 percent ) , innovation ( 83 percent ) and 193520 @qwx393520 <p> visibility across the organization ( 80 percent ) .

The top IoT use case is remote asset tracking by location ( 22 percent ) . <p> Well over half , or 60 percent , of health-care organizations use IoT : 64 percent for patient monitoring and 41 percent for X-ray/imaging , among the main devices connected to the network . <p> These applications are tied to cost savings , according to 73 percent of respondents ; and 80 percent reported an increase in innovation since using IoT. ad <p> Retail : IoT is helping retailers enhance the customer experience , as reported by 81 percent of respondents while 88 percent said IoT boosts business efficiency . <p> Forty-nine percent of global retailers have deployed IoT technology and 56 percent of these retailers allow personal mobile devices to access the network to create new and engaging retail experiences . <p> Government : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 42 percent of governments have adopted IoT . Sadly , though , more than 35 percent of IT decision makers within government reported that leadership had little understanding of IoT , which is twice the global average . Integration with legacy technology is one of the biggest obstacles to IoT adoption . <p> " So you have a lot of hype , a lot of promise about helping citizens through technology , but ultimately there certainly appears to be a big discrepancy between what policy makers truly understand and are implementing relative to what the technology folks within those environments are able to provide , " said Kozup . <p> Where government entities are adopting IoT : Fifty-seven percent are connecting building-security systems ; 32 percent are connecting street lights ; 20 percent are connecting vehicles driving toward the " smart city " future . The most popular IoT application is the remote monitoring and control of devices within city boundaries , according to 27 percent of respondents . <p> Despite some struggles , the benefits are real : Cost savings are reported by 71 percent of survey respondents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization . <p> Given that Arubas IoT study is global , its important to point out some key findings by geography .

Maybe the MSP can offer IT capabilities the internal team does n't have the resources to achieve ; often , an MSP delivers services at a better value and level of simplicity than a business could provide for itself . Compared with the prospect of developing or implementing a vendor solution without expert assistance , the basic advantages of enlisting an MSP are enough to win over many clients . <p> However , I 've found that there are other , sometimes less tangible , qualities that help MSPs stand out from the pack " practices and services that go beyond the expected . Using these methods can help you compete , even against much larger providers and those that seek to gain clients by offering cut-rate service . <p> 1 . Client Advocacy <p> Businesses most often do n't have the expertise or wherewithal to address technical issues they encounter with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert knowledge is probably a big part of why they hired an MSP in the first place . Say , for example , that a client has an issue with the speed of a piece of software . When a client contacts the vendor looking for support , it 's not uncommon that a vendor representative will brush off a complaint such as this , which lacks in technical detail . <p> The rep will often try to pass off issues as being caused by a lack of optimization with the hardware , network or whatever other source is believable , in an attempt to close the ticket and get the client off the phone . And , in most cases , the client will believe this explanation , having no insight into the reality of the situation . <p> A little-celebrated advantage of working with an MSP is that they can and should advocate on the behalf of their clients in these circumstances . MSPs will deliver this advocacy as a part of their service diagnostics , communicating with vendors to ensure the client is receiving the best experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gamely trying to offer the best support it can , the rep may not understand how to address the issue given the customer 's layman 's description . Whatever a vendor 's intentions , MSPs have the knowledge to demand the most out of them for their client 's benefit . <p> 2 . Creativity <p> MSPs will also apply their expertise to solve custom issues for clients , and get creative when necessary . Here 's an example from our own experience . A client of ours that works with X-ray machines needed a method for encrypting their IT systems . The client had a potential solution , but their plan involved an expensive system upgrade and costly encryption coverage for each of the company 's machines . <p> Before proceeding down that financially draining route , the client asked if we had any alternatives available . Employing our knowledge of available solutions and a little originality , we offered a more affordable solution . The client has now upgraded its old X-ray machine systems to include self-encrypting drives ( SEDs ) , which we 're able to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management tool . <p> Information on those machines is now encrypted , and the solution serves the client 's needs effectively . <p> I encourage creativity with my staff . It 's important that MSPs put their knowledge and connections to work by thinking hard about unique ways to solve client problems . Be sure to confer with your vendors for ideas as well " like ours , many will be pleased to help . <p> 3 . Vertical Expertise <p> MSPs have the experience and insight to understand the legal regulatory requirements governing the industries a client 's business is active in , and offer a practical application of this knowledge as a part of their services . In the healthcare field , for example , HIPAA requires that the electronic personal health information ( ePHI ) of patients is stored in a secure manner and emphasizes the importance of data encryption . To respond to specific client needs such as this , MSPs do n't need to become complete experts , but we do need to be able to offer guidance and deliver a capable solution . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compliance ; in our case , we use HIPAA Secure Now , a service that allows us to provide all clients that are HIPAA Covered Entities with the tools and safeguards they need to comply with the law . <p> Similarly , the- Breach Secure Now service allows us to help protect clients from data breaches , especially clients in industries where such protections are required . We recommend that MSPs maintain a general awareness of industry or geographically specific regulatory requirements that affect their current or potential clients . For instance , we 're keeping our eye on state legislation like New York 's new Cybersecurity Mandates for Employee Training , which has a strong potential to be adopted by other states . By being in-the-know about both industry-wide and localized regulatory requirements , MSPs increase their value to clients , and the likelihood that they 'll stick with you as a provider they trust through any regulatory changes . <p> Brian Largent is CEO at ArcLight Group , an IT support provider serving the Tulsa area . 193521 @qwx393521

Were looking for insights into evolving business models in this new era of distribution , product and technical service offerings , education and training , marketing/branding , credit and a myriad of other services. ** <p> By Matt Karst <p> Cloud- has been a dominating theme for the channel for the last several years- " and for good reason . IDC estimates that 70 percent- of CIOs embraced a cloud-first strategy in 2016 . Even more striking , 95 percent- of channel partners surveyed in a new , exclusive- Westcon-Comstor 2017 Voice of the Customer survey indicated that at least some of their customers are already exploring cloud . <p> Clearly there 's opportunity , but what customers want and how they want it continues to change . Increasingly , end users desire full cloud solutions that can reduce costs and make them more agile- " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that most solution providers say they do n't have the confidence to deliver full cloud solutions to customers , according to our survey . <p> The survey elicited 522 respondents , including MSPs , solution providers , systems integrators , telco agents and other channel partners . Only 9 percent- believe they are cloud-ready and do n't need help selling cloud . The overwhelming majority , however , recognized gaps in their skillset and that they need help to stay competitive. ad <p> Increasingly , distributors are the go-to partners for cloud enablement and delivery support , according to the study . Almost 80 percent- of channel partners said they already buy cloud services through one or more distributors . Why ? Because leveraging the right distributor 's services can accelerate your cloud business around- backup and recovery , IaaS , SaaS and managed services " - as well as provide access to a proven portfolio of cloud solutions from vendors focused on growing their cloud business through partners . <h> Building a Cloud Business <p> Many leading distributors have invested millions of dollars in developing innovative cloud tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel partners to take to market . <p> The Voice of the Customer study identified three key solution bundles being sold through the channel , and typically available through distribution : disaster recovery/backup ( which includes IaaS and security ) , office productivity ( including email , calendar and security ) , and unified communications ( UCaaS , devices and configuration services ) . Each bundle appeals to both IT buyers and lines of business ( LOB ) , and across a wide spectrum of vertical markets . <p> Nearly 60 percent- of channel partners are now selling cloud bundles , according to the survey . However , true success is perhaps best measured by a solution providers ability to address the specific business or industry needs of their customers . For example , partners capable of selling cloud-based patient recordkeeping or medical billing applications stand to expect more business from health-care clients than those selling horizontal solutions . <h> How Distributors Can Help <p> Overall , distributors can serve as your best friend helping you to build your cloud solutions and grow the business. - The survey details four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Get to Know Your Customers- " Nobody knows what your customers ' business challenges are more than your customers . They just do n't know how to solve them . Learning about your customer 's processes , pain points and problems can help you help them become more efficient , productive , and ultimately , more successful . Leverage distributor resources in technology and verticals to gain a better understanding of your clients . <p> Evaluate Your Own Capabilities- " Knowing what you can and can not do could be a critical component of a solution provider 's success . Identify gaps in your coverage to help you create a long-term road map to transform your business . Again , look to distributors for help . Chances are they have programs to help you ramp up business around those shortcomings while you develop those capabilities in-house . <p> Partner to Succeed- " Examine the cloud programs and tools offered by distributors , such as enablement programs , bundled solutions , support capabilities , etc . How rapidly can they scale your cloud capabilities ? How much analytics and insight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes with other parts of the business ? Their answers " and your needs " will go a long way toward choosing the right partner . <p> Develop Your Own Solutions- " Now that you know your customer , your own strengths and weaknesses , and whom you want to partner with , it 's all about execution . Scale your business by prioritizing investments in the three key bundled solutions mentioned above and by the support of your distributors as you gain the foundation and experience you need to grow the business . <p> End users ' cloud demand is only going to increase . IDC forecasts that digital transformation will be the heart of Global 2000 enterprise strategies by the end of 2017 , and that IT spending on third-platform technologies , solutions and services will increase to more than 50 percent- this year and to more than 60 percent- by 2020 . <p> Distributors such as Westcon-Comstor and others have the infrastructure , resources and expertise to help you become the cloud provider that your customers are looking for .

@@37500602 @6500602/ <h> The Pillars of Ciscos Intelligent Network <p> Like most companies , Cisco sees the potential for data analytics and new machine-learning algorithms to add intelligence to its products that can improve performance and security , automate operations , provide business insights and adapt to new situations through extensible software interfaces . These are keys to Ciscos strategy , which it describes as a platform " powered by intent and informed by context . " The foundation is a rebranded SDN Cisco now calls DNA Center ( nee ACI , application centric infrastructure ) . Like its progenitor , DNA Center provides a central network control plane and management platform that can consistently apply network policy and configuration across all network layers : core , edge , wireless and WAN . It does this by working with other elements of Ciscos increasingly-intelligent network devices that provide software control and programmability . <p> So far , the new network sounds like any other programmable network . Where Cisco appears to be raising the bar is in the application of data analytics and machine learning to network flows and traffic patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anomalies , provide application-level usage statistics and business insights and improve troubleshooting . What Cisco calls the network data platform will be a separate product that works with the retooled DNA Center . Marketing puffery aside , Cisco is far from unique in seeing the value of ML and AI to network management and security . Whether established competitors like Brocade , Carbon Black and HPE Aruba or startups like Balbix , Deep Instinct and Preferred Networks , there 's a torrent of activity around the application of AI to networking and security . <p> Another significant software component to Ciscos announcement is a new ability to analyze traffic , including encrypted packets , for security threats such as malware and APTs . Note that unlike deep packet inspection , Ciscos technology ca n't crack the encryption and analyze the payloads , but instead runs the flow patterns and other traffic metadata such as headers , source , destination and port numbers through some machine learning algorithms to identify suspicious flows with the " fingerprints of known threats . " Cisco claims this to be a unique feature that detects security problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of 10,000 ; however , similar pattern analysis of encrypted traffic has been previously described by several security researchers including the SANS Institute , University of North Carolina and Tsinghua University . Indeed , some of these predate the publication of Ciscos research underlying this feature . Furthermore , as mentioned above , there are many competitors applying machine learning to network security . <p> Of course , a major Cisco announcement would n't be complete without some hardware , and this time its an upgrade to the Catalyst line of edge switches with the 9000 line . The 9000-series is comprised of both fixed and modular configurations that feature a programmable ASIC that will allow Cisco to add new features via software updates and are optimized for the DNA Center management platform . Built as edge switches for the age intelligent and wireless devices , the 9000-series can act as a wireless controller and supports both PoE+ and UPOE devices . The 9000-series will also be the only switches that initially support encrypted traffic analysis , although Cisco expects the feature to be added to other switches and routers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include : <p> Support for purchasing DNA software as a subscription , either bundled in a Cisco ONE suite or as individual components . <p> A set of DNA consulting and implementation services to assist customers in the design , implementation , migration and optimization of next-generation networks . <p> A developer center to bootstrap the creation of custom DNA network applications and automations . <h> Availability ? Do n't  Hold Your Breath <p> Buried in all the new product build up is the cold reality that almost nothing will be available for quite a while . Indeed , the least exciting component , the updated Catalyst switches , is the only item currently orderable . Cisco claims that DNA center will enter " controlled availability " in August , which means who knows when it will arrive for the hoi polloi .

Think about the brands you purchase , such as Coca-Cola , Wrangler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name a few . Are these companies values determined by just their equipment , their products , their warehouses or factories ? No . These- companies are worth much more than their physical assets ; their brand has created a value that far exceeds the worth of their physical properties . <p> The best branding is built on a strong idea , an idea that you and your staff can hold on to , commit to and deliver upon .

By removing infrastructure as a barrier to rapid and massive scaling of applications , even the smallest companies can compete on a level playing field . The ease of use and accessibility of infrastructure as a service ( IaaS ) and platform as a service ( PaaS ) make it possible for an application to be created one day and used by thousands the next . <p> However , cloud is also rapidly evolving . Are you successfully learning and keeping up with the language of cloud ?

That 's the aim of a new AT&amp;T report , - The CEO 's Guide to Securing the Internet of Things , backed up by a survey of more than 500 high-level business and IT decision-makers at companies with at least 1,000 employees . <p> We asked Jason Porter , vice president of security solutions at AT&amp;T , about a major communications disconnect between technical experts and business leaders revealed in that report , which builds on the CEO-focused- Cybersecurity Insights study AT&amp;T released in October . <p> The technical experts oftentimes felt like they were just a scapegoat or a figurehead , put there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they werent able to get all the attention they wanted- " and resources they needed- " from senior leadership to be able to drive the fight forward , " says Porter . " And yet , we talked to board members and CEOs who thought cybersecurity was an immensely technical issue . They did n't know their role , how to get involved . " <p> That story is a familiar one to infosec pros , but Porter , who was formerly VP of DevOps for AT&amp;T Partner Solutions , says it is possible for partners to help bridge the gap . IoT is an ideal starting point because of the sheer potential upside for businesses- " Porter points to projected revenues north of $11 trillion by 2025- " and the scope of the problem . Most survey respondents , 85 percent , are considering , exploring or implementing IoT , but just 14 percent- have a formal audit process to even understand how many devices they have and whether these devices are secure. - - ad <p> The report offers specific examples , statistics and advice that 's relevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of business leaders " another worthwhile effort given that 68 percent of respondents say their companies plan to invest in IoT security in 2016 . Half of those organizations are earmarking at least 25 percent of their security budgets toward IoT , yet many are unsure where to begin . <p> AT&amp;T recommends a layered approach for securing IoT , giving executives a defined , structured process as well as best practices gleaned from the Industrial Internet as well as network and application security techniques . <p> We start with the device layer , " Porter says . " Then securing connectivity , then securing data and applications , and wrapping all of that in a threat envelope that allows you to really see the interactions between all the various aspects of those layers . " <p> Porter recommends 193520 @qwx393520 <p> aligning IoT plans with security from the get-go . <p> If you deploy IoT in a silo , say in a marketing or operations area , and do n't  bring security in upfront , we found a much lower confidence level , " he says , referring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efficacy of IoT security measures . Those that are confident have no air between security and IoT teams . <p> " That physical world meeting the virtual world is where we need to pay attention , " says Porter . <p> Much of the report is aimed at helping CEOs and business leaders assess risk . An important point is that with IoT , proprietary or customer data may not be the crown jewel . <p> " You 're only as secure as your weakest link , " says Porter . That may be a control unit in the cloud , it may be a connected car , it may be a decades-old SCADA system on a manufacturing floor . <p> AT&amp;T 's advice comprises four steps ; there 's much deeper detail in the report . <p> Assess risk with an eye to IoT .

If a customer has a data-centric security strategy , this is a bit of a change . While hacking a pacemaker or self-driving car is the stuff of movies and test tracks for now , that 's bound to change . <p> Align IoT strategy and security . IT and business units must be in agreement on the importance of security . Cross-organization , cross-functional collaboration is critical , says AT&amp;T . <p> Identify legal and regulatory issues . This includes looking at the multiple vendors that are involved in most IoT deployments . <p> Checks Itself Before It Wrecks Itself <p> Porter also discussed AT&amp;T 's partnership with Bayshore Networks , which specializes in industrial IoT security . Bayshore brings to the table 193520 @qwx393520 <p> a content-aware cybersecurity and operational policy platform that can block machine-specific cyberattacks , from both external and internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Porter . Consider a robot on a shop floor receiving commands from a remote or cloud-based control unit . Even when the source and destination are sound and validated , what if the command that was inserted tells a robot to discharge its fuel or send an erroneous notification that the ambient temperature shot up to a level at which the factory should shut down ? <p> That could cost billions of dollars of loss , " says Porter . That 's obviously a tremendous risk for those industrial firms . " <p> Bayshore can fill that gap ; its platform prevents such disruptions and protects high-value equipment and workers by enforcing operational and safety policies . <p> Were putting them in line between the control unit and the robots , " says Porter . Because the Bayshore application sits in the AT&amp;T network cloud , it can prevent malicious commands from reaching a factory floor without introducing latency . <p> Porter says he s met with AT&amp;Ts Alliance- Channel and AT&amp;T Partner Exchange ; he sees wide agreement that customers want to move to IoT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networking for its security benefits . <p> There 's a lot of nervousness , " says Porter .

About 1,200 partners will attend the April 24-26 event to hear company executives talk about products and programs . <p> In particular , attendees will learn more about the retooling of the Lenovo Partner Program , which highlights the vendors ongoing shift to the data center . Last year , for example , Lenovo rolled out StorSelect next-gen software-defined storage and an enhanced suite of its HX Series of hyperconverged appliances . The company also opened up a SPIFF program to all network partners in a push to sell select PC and data-center products . And , Lenovo also hinted about upcoming changes in its partner program . <p> And , just this week , Lenovo announced the DX8200D , a turnkey software-defined storage appliance , the latest in its SDS portfolio . <p> Channel Partners recently talked to Sammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what partners can expect at next months conference and for their businesses in the upcoming months . <p> Channel Partners : What are some key things happening at Lenovo that partners need to know about ? <p> Sammy Kinlaw : Most important is the opportunity for partners to take Data Center Group ( DCG ) sales and technical classes that lead to certifications and to learn more about the April 1 launch of the new Data Center Program and classifications . Also on April 1 , our new fiscal year , we unveil our new incentive stack . Well also be talking about our new PC products on the Intel Kaby Lake platform , and opportunities in workstations and servers. ad <p> CP : Would you elaborate on the data-center program ? <p> SK : Yes , because its extremely important in our evolution from our System x acquisition from IBM . Were in our ninth quarter since acquiring that business . During that timeframe , we 've made lots of refinements and we 've certainly refined our strategy , which is to make the most reliable , secure x86 architecture products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of partners that surround it whether were talking Red Hat , Nutanix , Pivot3 our goal is to make and provide the best hardware surrounded or associated with the best leading software-defined vendors . <p> Now well talk about how that mission works in the partner community . We 've preannounced this but now its coming to fruition were announcing a tiering structure for our partners . The tiering structure is based off of revenue and <p> KC : Lenovos heritage with our value-added reseller community of small partners is incredibly valuable to us , and frankly , has been the biggest growth engine in the channel for Lenovo for two years running . So all partners will still have the opportunity and be afforded the ability to earn rebates and have eligibility to special bids combined with distribution . <p> Up until now partners could be Lenovo authorized and there werent any certifications . <p> All of our authorized partners in North America , about 30,000 , will be in the Silver category . As you move up the stack to the Gold level , its going to require at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certifications . To move into the Platinum level you need to have at least $10 million in revenue and additional certifications . <p> The program is designed to be very line of sight , straightforward , easy to follow as to how you get in and what the benefit statement is. ad <p> Simply , Lenovo wants to pay for growth and acquisition and were going to reward partners that have unique designations and qualifications , and were going to reward partners that are loyal and willing to invest the time and with that comes more revenue stream . <p> CP : What are you expecting to see in terms of partners transitioning into the new program ? <p> SK : Weve done a look back so we already know which partners fall into which **28;285;TOOLONG .

We also want to give our end-user community a sense of who has walked hand in hand with us , who understands our products , processes our engineering . <p> When I preannounced this program on Jan. 1 , I wanted to give partners the opportunity to get ahead . So weve already given out more than 130 certifications taken over the last nine weeks . There are about 10 certifications that are already out and they 're a mix between tech certs and sales certs . <p> On the horizon are certifications in high performance computing ( HPC ) , hyperconverged , Lenovo storage and networking , etc. this is ongoing education for us . We plan on announcing 193520 @qwx393520 <p> new certifications quarterly that partners can take . <p> CP : Clearly , there are big changes going on at Lenovo . <p> SK : Yes . Looking at the DCG , the quarter ending Dec. 31 was a milestone quarter for us because we returned to year-on-year growth . Its been a decline for us , a struggle , and we 've lost big account names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cliff Gumkowski vice president and general manager DCG Solution Sales since April 2016 ; prior to that he was with Dell for 15 years , we 've been able to refine our data-center efforts by building out dedicated DCG sales teams .

And , we brought back headcount dedicated to that mission . So last quarter was a return to year-on-year growth and the current quarter is yielding a trajectory that shows year-on-year growth , so specialization is where its at with DCG. ad <p> CP : What about the broader Lenovo business ? <p> SK : Looking at Lenovos PC business , our North America business accounts for almost 15 percent share ; that 's an approximately 2 percent share increase year on year . Were one of the big vendors , and with about 15 percent share , we 've got many quarters of growth opportunity ahead of us .

With 42 percent share in the commercial channel , I 'm entrenched in many areas . To grow , I need to understand where were under-indexed and we have to double down our efforts . Today , I can tell you I 'm going to be pushing our workstation business Lenovo has an entire platform of mobile and desktop workstations where we can compete in the commercial market against any manufacturer and were under-indexed there so I expect to take double-digit gains in share for workstations . I 'm looking to grow our desktop business as surprising as that might sound and I 'm going to be driving our services business around the box services such as extended warranty , and keep-your-drive service offerings , that kind of thing . <p> In the mobile market the Chrome market according to NPD , were No. 1 . The problem we have with Chrome is the realization its driven by a cheaper OS and average unit revenue .

To ensure that we and our sponsors have sufficient time to plan for each location , we typically book our sites two years in advance . <p> In 2015 , we visited Charlotte , North Carolina , and felt that it was an excellent match for the Evolution event .

We had hoped that this pressure would cause the state to reconsider its actions . It has not . And , it is our judgment that neither the legislature nor governor are likely to reevaluate HB2 , and that the federal suit brought against the state will not be resolved by Sept. 2017 . <p> Channel Partners stands with the local government of Charlotte and its compassionate and appropriate law , which was nullified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlotte can protect its visitors and citizens as it sees fit .

The Q&amp;A has been edited for length and clarity . <p> Channel Partners : What is one specific opportunity for growth/revenue within IoT ? <p> Natasha Royer Coons : There are a lot of opportunities in fleet tracking . The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ( FMCSA ) has mandated the adoption and use of electronic logging devices ( ELDs ) by all drivers required to complete paper records of duty status . The rule kicks in over the next couple of years and applies to commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers using time cards .

Quite simply , you do n't  know what you do n't  know . The air time is straightforward : you pick your carrier . The platform is a little more challenging but not too difficult .

Vendors are providing solutions that vary tremendously , from the problems solved , to the technology used and the complexity of implementation and maintenance . Not to mention cost ! Pick partners that can clearly tell you what they are doing why and how . For our partners to be successful , they need to be able to understand what were doing . That 's why we break it down and keep it simple . We talk about what we can deliver today not future promises that are light years away and cost zillions of dollars . We help companies securely tag , track , manage and locate all of their assets in real time . We do this today around the country . In a way that is cost-effective and scalable .

The insurance company is planning to roll out an IoT solution for all of the vehicles in their fleet .

Why would IoT be any different ? <p> Of course , GTDC members and other distributors are n't  operating in a vacuum .

You have to describe the business value of your solution in the context of an industry vertical , " Hume said . <p> Indeed , its time for solution providers to start initiating IoT conversations with their customers . If you 're unsure of where to start , or of what to talk about , chat first with your favorite distribution partner to help get up to speed . <p> Ask your distributor what IoT solutions they currently carry , particularly around a vertical market or a technology you specialize in .

We 're looking for insights into evolving business models in this new era of distribution , product and technical service offerings , education and training , marketing/branding , credit and a myriad of other services. ** <p> By Sergio Farache <p> In the last few years , the distribution industry has experienced several sea changes and challenges , as dynamics such as technology commoditization , margin pressure and the slowdown of the classic IT market growth alter the evolution of the channel . Distribution has been employing approaches like scale , efficiency and services to continue its intended journey toward providing value to the suppliers and partners- " both critical components of the current two-tier model that has defined the industry for many years . <p> The two-tier model presumes that value is created by a linear process from the suppliers to the distributor to the partner to the end user . The model provides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the value creation is limited to the players and by fact that each member relies on their capabilities and investment power . Technology has been a fundamental element of this model as a support layer of the business , providing efficiency , scale and control . Several technology features , such as the e-commerce and brokerage platform , have played the same role for a new set of offerings and services , but both technologies are following the same linear two-tier business model . <p> The next-generation technologies enable disruption in many industries , and the deep integration between technology and business models creates the opportunity to transition the value-creation process to a broader group of players . Today 's disruptors such as Uber , Airbnb and Amazon , for example , have demonstrated that enabling this value creation to all possible participants maximizes the network effect- " creating additional value to all participants , expanding their offerings and services , but moreover producing an opportunity for that disrupting flywheel effect that spurs growth in an exponential manner. ad <p> Analysis performed by consulting firm Deloitte described the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way : Ecosystems are dynamic and co-evolving communities of diverse actors who create and capture new value through increasingly sophisticated models of both collaboration and competition . " <p> I took the liberty of using the Deloitte approach to define the Digital IT Distribution Ecosystem . This ecosystem is a dynamic and co-evolving community of IT B2B actors , i.e. producers and consumers , who create , provide , consume and capture current and the new value ( intellectual property , products , software and services ) through commercial interactions , collaboration , enablement , exchange and competition . <p> The IT distribution industry is beginning to realize that the two-tier model will limit- its ability to capitalize on the total market opportunity available , and some disruptors are expanding their models to a new value-creation paradigm . The industry is perfectly positioned for this transition , but it should move , adapt fast and invest in a deep integration between a new business model that enables the value creation across the ecosystems that they serve and a new generation of digital platforms that support and enable the new approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides scale but limits the value-creation aspect , and the ecosystem model offers the possibility to all the members , i.e. producers and consumers , to participate and provide additional value . The new role of distribution should be to position itself as the center part of those ecosystems , making it simple for its members to aggregate or combine value . The new distribution era posits that distribution will work on a multi-point or n-tier schema and bidirectional transactional model , providing value on the core competencies that each ecosystem needs . As such , the value creation is enabled across the ecosystem , eliminating pain points , friction points and generating trust through content curation and compliance checking . <p> The new ecosystem digital platforms will utilize some foundational elements to accomplish this transition : <p> Enable end-to-end digital transactions between all members of the ecosystem . <p> Eliminate friction and pain points across the interactions . <p> Create and facilitate entanglement and instant satisfaction . <p> Enable and capitalize on the use of data to improve the ecosystem , anticipate the needs , and maximize the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bundle their products and services to deliver a better solution and customer experience . <p> Enable content curation and filtering as consequences of the real value provided and ecosystem member participation . <p> Satisfy the needs that consumers and producers have in order to use , cooperate and integrate into the value-creation process . <p> The deep integration of technology and new business process to enable the different ecosystems and the value creation across producers and consumers that participate in them will allow for a positive flywheel effect with exponential economic consequences . A new generation of distribution will challenge the status quo and disrupt the traditional approach to the business . <p> IT distribution is entering a unique chapter to transition from the middle position on a two-tier model to the center position of an ecosystem model .

Facing tough competition from cloud providers ; demand from customers who want faster connectivity to on-demand services and advanced technologies like IoT , virtual reality and robotics , service providers with their legacy infrastructures , current cloud implementations and existing bandwidth are not meeting market demands . <p> The answer needs to be more than " upgrade equipment , add bandwidth and implement software-defined networking technologies against a legacy infrastructure . " They must also build network functions virtualization infrastructures ( NFVi ) ; embrace new concepts such as fog computing to enable architectures that support zero-latency computing ; and automate service life-cycle orchestration so they have the flexibility to move application resources network , compute or storage wherever they are needed . <p> Oh , and to maximize its potential , zero-latency computing also requires micro services-based applications . <p> Its a tall order , but by incorporating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they want . Partners need to ask their telco partners about plans and prospects . <h> Virtualization Next Steps <p> Let 's look at various terms . <p> NFVi provides the framework for compute , storage and networking resources on which virtual networks are built . NFV management and orchestration is the integrated system of components used to operate the NFVi . Virtualized network functions ( VNFs ) are not part of management and orchestration ; they are the components that process production data in the NFVi . VNF is a software function that is decoupled from the underlying physical hardware . <p> Fog computing ( think in meteorological terms : cloud , closer to the ground ) is a concept that allows cloud resources to be logically and efficiently positioned anywhere on the continuum from the data consumer to the data center . <p> Zero-latency computing is when no time is lost during the exchange of information between application interfaces ; therefore , the system is able to respond instantly to an application-layer request . Moreover , low latency ( ideally , zero latency ) is essential for applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is critical in a scenario , for instance , when a surgeon conducts remote surgery using robotics . Currently , many medical robots have a two-second lag , a delay that could be problematic when conducting high-stakes surgeries . Many IoT , virtual reality and other next-gen applications also require a strong network that delivers services in near real-time . <p> What will it take to get there ? For one , telcos will have to eliminate the silos that still exist in their infrastructures and organizations so they can become more agile .

Prebuilt Cloud Connect integrations allow for data backup to public cloud services , including AWS and Microsoft Azure . <p> Nikita Maheshwari , senior product marketing manager at Nutanix , told Channel Partners that Xpress is tailored specifically for SMBs its not a scaled-down version of the companys Xtreme Computing Platform , even though the core technology principles are the same . <p> " Our CEO really advocated that he did n't  want to make this just a new platform in our enterprise portfolio , " said Maheshwari . " We really wanted to make a new product line , with dedicated engineering , a product road map and enablement . " <p> Maheshwari said Nutanix saw better-than-expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplicity of deployment and management and emphasis on a hybrid cloud architecture . Nutanix partners were asking for an SMB-focused system , and the company worked with the channel to get specs right . <p> " When we were developing the product , we did a lot of interviews , " she said. ad <p> Nutanix Xpress starts as low as $25,000 for a three-node system with three years of support .

A Nutanix node comprises a server with direct-attached storage able to support as many as 500 VMs , depending on size .

While customers can run VMware or another hypervisor , AHV , which is based on a hardened version of KVM , is bundled and eliminates virtualization licensing costs a big part of the value proposition . <p> " The margin on our product is very good and healthy , and we find our partners are doing just fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to garner with our solution , " said Morgan in that interview . <p> Maheshwari says the enterprise Nutanix line spans verticals from health care to retail , SLED and financial services , and she expects a similar broad uptake with Xpress . One caveat is that a customer with many remote or branch offices that needs centralized management should look to the Xtreme offering versus Xpress . <p> For the new product , Nutanix cites the example of a midsize law firm with IT manpower and budget constraints , a five-year-old SAN approaching full capacity and end of support , and racks of older x86 servers that struggle to support the latest versions of critical applications . With Xpress , partners could gradually shift that customer , adding 193520 @qwx393520 <p> new nodes as needed , from a legacy environment to a hyperconverged stack . <p> For partners , all software is pre-installed , and systems can be up and running in less than 60 minutes . <p> " This is going to be a very channel-driven product , " Maheshwari said .

Meanwhile , a survey by IDG Enterprise shows 54 percent of all organizations from the largest enterprises to the smallest SMBs will adopt hybrid unified communications and collaboration by years end . <p> The big value proposition for SMBs in mixing on-premises and cloud UC&amp;C is that they can protect sunk investments while getting the advanced communications services they need to stay competitive . The full range of traditional CPE-based business communications services are now available on cloud platforms , from smartphone backups to multimedia collaboration to enterprise-class instant messaging , presence , flexible web conferencing and collaboration tools , data storage , and more . <p> For SMB customers with recently installed communication infrastructures , hybrid cloud is the ideal upgrade solution . These services may be added on a per-capability , and often a pay-per-use , basis to allow them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need them . The hybrid approach also provides a well-paved migration path . As existing on-premises equipment becomes obsolete , customers are already in a position to understand the pros and cons of cloud-based services , enabling them to make the best decisions for their future communications platforms . <p> As a partner , ensure you can seamlessly integrate UCaaS into the existing infrastructure . Then , arm salespeople with these talking points : <p> You need to offer employees flexible , collaborative workplaces : Todays mobility-obsessed workforce has led to a complete rethink of how people collaborate . The open office culture is typified by home-working , geographically separated teams spread across multiple time zones . The " hot-desking " phenomenon poses a further challenge . All this adds an unwelcome layer of complexity to providing a single point of collaboration , and current premises-based communication systems have not adapted . This reality has forced businesses to divert resources and make costly investments in stacking on new ( often siloed ) platforms to continue supporting business needs . <p> And , as acquisitions and mergers become more common , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructures leave merged businesses at a technological disadvantage . <p> SMBs need the security of professional backup and support : A key aspect of the hybrid approach is the ability to keep control and sensitive data in-house but shift the burden of service maintenance and support to the cloud provider . Recent ransomware attacks have shown the risk for companies without professional security and disaster recovery strategies . Hardware and software are updated remotely to eliminate maintenance delays and ensure security , and multiyear support contracts mean SMBs routinely benefit from major security and functionality updates . <p> Downtime means lost business : Network and communications redundancy is simply an unwelcome expense that few can afford , meaning there is zero room for network downtime . Hybrid cloud removes much of the management and maintenance burden facing SMBs , which often lack some of the IT skills available to larger companies , instead tasking the solution provider and the MSP or trusted reseller with maximizing uptime using remote management to provide support and troubleshooting . <p> Dr. Jack Jachner brings more than 20 years of telecommunications industry experience to Alcatel-Lucent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

How do they differ from your competitors ? <p> Pope : We have what we call technology partners who want to build a solution on our platform and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apple or Google , and those models . They want to sell to enterprises . So you 've got smaller shops , smaller partners in some cases , who build some cool apps , good functionality , but do n't  necessarily have the leverage , reach or the marketing might of ServiceNow . But through our store , they 're able to get to some really , really big , strategic customers around the world as a result . And that just makes life so much easier growing and expanding the platform . <p> And then in the real sort of channel space , for the first couple of years they were definitely doing more 193520 @qwx393520 <p> professional-services work , and that was fine because that 's where their core strength is . But then what also started happening was these guys realized that they do n't  want to be a product company , but say where they specialize in health care or a vertical like financial services , if they 're doing the same thing two or three times in a row , then there 's obviously an opportunity there to productize what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readiness kit that can be deployed quickly and easily . And it gives them even more margin and they can actually get things implemented more quickly in a much more consistent way and a much more repeatable way . <p> Channel Partners : ServiceNow is placing more emphasis on the partner ecosystem regionally . What does that mean and how is that different from what 's in place ? <p> Pope : Part of it is we are verticalizing more than we ever have . So within certain regions , whether its regulatory , country conditions , data sovereignty or just sort of certain skilled resources for certain industries , there are partners who will specifically have subject-matter experts in financial services or health care , or leisure or transportation , or manufacturing and so on . So for us , we want sort of a really good bench of the core product , which is our IT service management groups , but also then partners that can go and talk to financial-services customers or health care , or government or public sector and so on , because its a slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with . And having relevance and credibility in their space gets you over many hurdles very quickly , because at the core of what we do , were a technology company , and we can take conversations so far , but when you get into sort of regulatory stuff and banking , and health care , and PII and PCI , that 's where you need people that really have the credentials to deliver and talk , and really execute in that space . And particularly in public-sector levels of clearance and all of those types of things . We can scale to an extent , but there are already lots of partners that are doing this , and therefore enables us to turn and tailor our message more specific to the industry , but also the geography in certain regions , who are closer to what the changes are . So for us , its an extension of what were already doing , but to some extent a specialization as well. ad <p> Channel Partners : ServiceNow has a new CEO and new channel executives . What will these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a new CEO ; that 's the huge news of the week . And I think what John Donahoe brings to us from his work at Bain as well as other organizations is taking us beyond the enterprise and bringing that sort of consumerized view of the world to our organization , but also to our products . And off the back of that , we 've had the channel and partner community pretty much since day one and it was run globally , but executed locally . But now more and more with lots of Global 2000 and Global 25 customers , they do operate globally and we have to be able to have a level of not only seniority in the region , but someone who can take full accountability . So the two new vice presidents are an example of that . Having someone really dedicated with a focus of what goes on 193520 @qwx393520 <p> in the region , how its delivered and how its executed , while reporting to a global head who sits in North America gives us time and geography challenges with that model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot simpler and easier to execute with a level of autonomy . <p> Channel Partners : What sort of feedback has ServiceNow received from partners regarding the partner program and strategy ? Are there things they like , changes they 're hoping to see ? <p> Pope : We release our product twice a year in terms of updates and upgrades , and they want a heads up earlier in that cycle so that they can position , they can get ready and potentially get a differentiation over other players , or where they 've implemented a previous technology from another provider , have we got something that 's competitive or displacing , and they want to get ahead of that. ad <p> Some of them are product-driven and others want to work better together in terms of go-to-market and verticalization , and messaging . I do a lot of work in our financial-services space and Ive probably got 10 partners right now that I 'm working with on how do we better leverage their knowledge in where they 're embedded with customers already on things outside of IT that we potentially do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us on the journey because there are a lot of things that they can help us with in terms of educational awareness , but also as a sort of generic methodology of delivering service management , then we absolutely can help and fit into that space with them . <p> Channel Partners : How is 2017 shaping up for ServiceNow ? <p> Pope : It will be a big one . Were definitely tracking that way , both from a people and financial standpoint . Changing the CEO , we 've got a new head of product , new channel lead and so on ; it has been a lot of change , certainly at the senior level of the organization . But the thing that 's never dropped is we have this flawless execution and customers are our No. 1 priority . Off the back of that , last year we launched two new products around customer service and security-operations management or response , and they 're like little startup business units , but have taken off like wildfire . <p> And there are other things that were doing in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next release in June this year that again will try to distance us from all of our competitors because they 're just not innovating in this space . <p> And with the talent and the people were hiring , its really to drive inefficiencies out , but also accelerate us even more on the journey that were on . So the view of the world is very good from that standpoint , but ultimately customer satisfaction is what were trying to achieve . And we 've seen with all the big partners , and all the MSPs and the SIs of the world , they want to come and play , they want to be part of our journey , which is just a testament to doing the right things . And I think if we continue to do that , there are only good things for us on the runway . 193521 @qwx393521

In a briefing , Denise Zelt , the companys senior manager of channel programs , said the company is focused on enablement and growing the percentage of sales coming through partners . A channel veteran , Zelt has been with Delphix for nine months and previously held leadership roles at Hitachi Data Systems and Convergys . <p> She acknowledges that data-virtualization technology is still relatively new but says partners are finding it solves a number of problems for customers . Delphix can help companies that depend on SQL databases with archiving , cloud migrations , data-center consolidation , business agility , and security and compliance . <p> A production database is ingested into the Delphix engine . As changes are made , this mirrored instance is automatically updated . The full production database may then be cloned through a simple , self-service user interface quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage and presented to developers , testers , business analysts or whomever needs it . <p> Because the Delphix engine is presented as storage , the original database believes its talking to a storage device . Disposable , virtualized instances can be quickly spun up and deleted , so the customer is not paying to store multiple copies . And , integrated data masking means sensitive information , such as Social Security numbers , can be obfuscated while maintaining the database structure , meaning these images can be stored in the cloud or shared with offshore teams . Without masking , sensitive information would need to be replaced with synthetic data , but that can hinder analysis . Delphix also offers tokenization. ad <p> Delphix works with AWS , Oracle , Microsoft SQL Server , IBM DB2 and SAP .

" It just takes a long time to send that through a pipe . " <p> The product may also save significantly on storage , as it does data deduplication at the application instead of the filesystem level . A partner or IT team could use the product to quickly restore a deleted or damaged database , or dig into 193520 @qwx393520 <p> the root cause of an application problem related to the back-end database without impacting the production system . <p> Zelt says partners may now engage on an associate/referral level , as a reseller , as a full alliance partner or as a services professional that really dives into customer use cases . Delphix is interested in helping partners build services on top of the product . Examples include supporting distributed development teams , providing data masking for security , easing cloud migrations by making structured data more portable and minimizing storage demands , and adding Delphix to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown jewels of a customers infrastructure , so enabling almost instant restores is a significant value add . <p> The system may be deployed either fully in the cloud , on premises or run in a hybrid model . While banking and financial services are the hottest vertical for Delphix , Chargin says health care , retail , oil and gas , and consumer packaged goods are also promising markets . The baseline for the technology is small enterprises on up ; 30 percent of the Fortune 500 are customers . The company was founded in 2008 and has raised about $120 million in venture funding from investors including In-Q-Tel , Greylock Partners and Battery Ventures . <p> Zelt says Delphix has added employees dedicated to partner education and announced additional Partner University events . The digital learning program boasts 27 courses , with tailored perspectives on how Delphix serves a variety of global markets and specific industries . <p> " We rely on our partners to help demonstrate how moving that data can be done better and faster with Delphix , " says Zelt .

AT&amp;T is virtualizing its network ; cloud computing services are selling six times faster than overall IT spending ; and consumers are spending more than 60 hours a week consuming content across multiple channels and devices . Each of these factors tells a story on its own ; but , taken together , they show the marked shift that 's happening across the telecom industry . Everything from product development to go-to-market and channel strategy will be impacted . To be successful in this new era of telecommunications will require companies to pay attention first and foremost to the bedrock of their business : the workforce . Or , more specifically , its availability . <p> Traditional Hiring Practices Are No Longer Applicable <p> The old ways of recruiting and hiring skilled professionals capable of handling sophisticated telecom work are no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poles to install cable modems or sales teams who can go door-to-door , the industry is desperate for innovators and software developers , particularly those who can set trends and form thought-leadership strategies as technology and customer demands continue to evolve . These individuals know they are in demand , so they choose to be selective about whom they work for and when . This leaves the rest of the market fighting for a select few individuals ; in fact , of the 37,000 global employers interviewed in a 2014 survey by McKinsey , 36 percent reported they " could not find the talent they needed . " That 's a lot of unfilled roles . <p> Bringing on contractors who can reduce overhead , close gaps caused by understaffing and focus on immediate-need projects has long been a successful strategy for hiring managers , but posting a job ad and then handling the resulting influx of applications and interviews simply takes up too much time and energy . This is especially true nowadays , when the industrys changing needs mean todays exciting new hire could be next months redundant employee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? In short , embrace the " gig economy . " <p> The New World of Flexible , Project-Based Work <p> To efficiently bring on the best-suited talent for each task or project , telecom leaders need to embrace a new workforce model . Popularized by customer-facing businesses such as Uber , using technology to hire contract workers and independent experts is beginning to extend upmarket and enter the business plans of larger enterprises . These innovative companies are finding they can access a specialized , professional , independent workforce using cloud-enabled talent-access platforms . <p> Many external specialists make some or all of their living through completing short-term , project-based work via these platforms . Nearly one-third of U.S. workers earns income by embracing a sort of " portfolio career , " during which they hop among several part-time gigs rather than spending eight ( or more ) hours every day enclosed within one employers four walls . This strategy is becoming popular among companies , too : As of 2015 , approximately 90 percent of businesses in the U.S. used freelance workers in some capacity . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses get more done through less time and more efficient spending . Independent workers have chosen this path for themselves because it offers flexibility and freedom , and in order to embrace the agility and competitiveness that todays telecom industry calls for , companies must do the same . Telecom leaders can bring on professional workers with track records of success and specific knowledge in areas such as small cell infrastructure , near-field communication or 5G , and once the project is complete , free them up to work on other projects until their skills are needed again . Its a system that truly benefits everyone . <p> Planning and budgeting . Leaders should prioritize the work that needs to get done and determine whether it should be executed by a full-time employee or an external talent . Budgeting should be adjusted in a way that managers are incentivized to find the best ways to meet their objectives , rather than simply increase full-time head count . <p> Procurement . Move away from traditional , one-size-fits-all contracting and payment policies and procedures . This way , its easier to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hiring-related technology . Onboarding and implementing a flexible talent-access platform is n't very difficult , and requires brief training and onboarding to get up and running . <p> Human resources . The HR department will play a critical role in the implementation and coordination of a freelance workforce . They should focus on talent " access " rather than " acquisition , " as well as lead curation of the talent ecosystem . HR should strive to become the " partner of choice " for independent professionals and create and implement internal campaigns to this end . <p> Training . This was touched on above , but its worthy of its own spot . Managers will need to learn how to contract with , pay , and manage individual contributors , and they should be trained on managing scope , launching teams , and providing feedback and coaching to individuals they do not formally control . Finding the right platform that can make this easy will make a huge difference . <p> New technology and increased content consumption will continue to create challenges for the telecom industry , and the companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as gig-economy workers . Through freelance workers , real-time changes can be addressed quickly and at a lower cost , and efficient hiring can be approached proactively . The alternative allowing a " this is just the way it is " mindset to interfere with progress can no longer be entertained as an option . <p> Chris Collins is the general manager of the technology , media and telecommunications practice at Catalant Technologies .

With any large move like this in the marketplace , the companies in question always list the many reasons why this makes sense for their shareholders and their customers . What does n't  get talked about is , " is this good for the partner channel ? " <p> Telarus partners with both CenturyLink and Level 3 , giving us a unique perspective of this news and what the channel needs to be thinking about as they make long-term alignment plans . Here is what we know . <p> The combined entity will be controlled by CenturyLink . According to the official press release : " CenturyLink shareholders will own approximately 51 percent and Level 3 shareholders will own approximately 49 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of channel , usually the acquirer makes the decisions on how to structure the resulting channel program , but given the similar sizes of the channels , its difficult to say which program will win out in the end . We hope that theyll take the best elements of both programs . The deal is n't expected to close until Q3 2017 , giving the channel teams at CenturyLink ( led by John DeLozier ) and Level 3 ( led by Garrett Gee ) plenty of time to work through this and take input from partners. ad <p> Compensation model . The first thing John and Garrett will need to discuss will be their new compensation plan . Will they adopt the current CenturyLink plan , which rewards partners for total book of business combined with ongoing production ? As of today , CenturyLink offers a compensation plan that will lower a partners future commission if they slip below a quarterly performance metric , where Level 3 commission is static . Second , CenturyLink and Level 3 both pay different amounts for the same products , so we expect some reconciliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some visibility into this early next year . <p> Rules of engagement . The second important policy that John and Garretts teams will need to consider is the new Rules of Engagement . As it stands now , each company will allow channel partners to sell into accounts jointly with a direct sales rep , assuming the appropriate approvals are given . Weve seen dramatic shifts in ROE policy from CenturyLink over the years as it relates to " channel integration , " so it will be interesting to see where this falls once the two companies roll out their combined channel . Many agents rely on the ability to team with direct reps ( both local and national ) to run their model , so this will be critical . <p> Support . Partners of CenturyLink and Level 3 have vastly different experiences with support . With CenturyLink , there is a sizable amount of 193520 @qwx393520 <p> effort and knowledge of CenturyLinks systems that is required . Many , like Telarus , have had to hire current or former CenturyLink employees to help improve our partners experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services . We made CenturyLink a focus of ours many years ago and have since assembled an all-star team of CenturyLink veterans to help our partners sell more . <p> On the Level 3 front , most of the enterprise support is handled by our national channel manager , Richard Fry , and the local channel managers who support Telarus in the markets in which our partners live . The Telarus back-office team supports most of the less-complex sales , augmenting the Level 3 support team . Four months ago , Telarus hired Level 3s Jay Littleford to take over as our regional VP of California . We still rely on him when we have questions about Level 3s processes , product nuance , and escalations. ad <p> Because of the complexity of the large operations of both organizations , the combined entity will be even more complex , especially during the integration which could take years . The new organization will need to invest in new support systems and will require master agents to provide a tremendous amount of pre- and post-sales support to bridge the transition . Telarus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the support of CenturyLink and Level 3 . <p> Product mix . When CenturyLink and Level 3 combine , partners will have access to one of the largest fiber footprints in the world . According to CenturyLink : <p> " This transaction increases CenturyLinks network by 200,000 route miles of fiber , which includes 64,000 route miles in 350 metropolitan areas and 33,000 subsea route miles connecting multiple continents . Accounting for those served by both companies , CenturyLinks on-net buildings are expected to increase by nearly 75 percent to approximately 75,000 , including 10,000 buildings in EMEA and Latin America . " <p> According to our lit-building research , there is only 5 percent overlap between the two , creating a very synergistic and profitable mix of fiber assets . <p> To source fiber , you need to know where the fiber is , where the splice points are located , and which buildings currently have the requisite edge gear . Telarus has a team of 10 software developers that have developed a smartphone app that shows our partners , free of charge , where fiber routes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Partners who are looking to sell CenturyLink/Level 3 fiber will need a tool like this so that they can know how and where to sell the product successfully . <p> Scale . Once this merger/acquisition has been completed , it will become the No. 3 carrier with approximately $19 billion in pro forma business revenue and $13 billion in business strategic revenue . <p> If you have a contract directly with one , but not the other , you 'll be instantly disadvantaged from 193520 @qwx393520 <p> a pure scale standpoint . In most channel programs , the top commission and support tiers are reserved for the channel partners with the biggest book of business and the largest monthly revenue production . Here at Telarus , we work directly with both Level 3 and CenturyLink , so our combined efforts will allow us to scale with the new company . If the master agent you use now is n't contracted with BOTH entities , they stand to look about half as big as they did yesterday , putting commission points and support at risk. ad <h> Conclusion <p> Its clear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the scale that will be achieved and the elimination of a competitor in the marketplace . We believe this transaction will be approved by regulators and that partners should prepare to work with the combined organization . The good news is that partners have over 10 months to make the adjustments necessary to protect their recurring revenue and years of hard work . With change comes opportunity , especially if you have the right tools and relationships . <p> Adam Edwards and Patrick Oborn are co-founders of Telarus , the voice and data master agent , and technology provider . 193521 @qwx393521

@@37500731 @6500731/ 193519 @qwx393519 <h> blog <p> When journalists Neil Howe and William Strauss first coined the term " millennial , " it was 1991 . Howe and Straus , both scholars of inter-generational change , had research predicting that the emerging generation , native to the coming technological wave , would be far different from their baby-boomer and Gen-X cohorts . These " digital natives " would hold different values , cultivate different relationships and communicate in different ways . <p> To some extent , this was n't anything new . Every generation rejects norms and behaviors of the group that came before . But even compensating for predictable change , Howe and Strauss foresaw something tectonic : that millennials , the oldest of whom were barely middle-schoolers , would forge an entirely new relationship with the world around them . <p> How right they were . Sixteen years later , this generation is characterized by sophisticated consumption and social consciousness . They expect authentic interactions with brands , they demand personalized service , and they treasure their individuality . While these observations stem from social context , the same priorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strauss bracketing , the oldest millennials are now 35 . Were moving beyond a time when we can think of millennials exclusively as a new type of end-of-the-chain consumer . They 're gathering influence and reaching seniority in the businesses in which they work . <p> In fact , a survey of 262 businesses by the Arketi Group found more than half of millennials describe themselves as decision-makers for technology purchases within their organizations . One-third report having the budget and/or sign-off authority for enterprise technology purchases of $10,000 and up . <p> Just as consumer-facing businesses have changed to embrace Millennial consumers flocking to Instagram and expanding their corporate social responsibility initiatives so must channel companies adapt to the growing corporate clout of professional millennials . <h> Experience vs . Possession <p> The most important difference between millennials and older IT decision-makers is that they value experiences more than possessions . Experiences are n't  necessarily outcompeting physical products , but millennial IT decision-makers are likely to weigh the experience that surrounds a product or service more heavily than their predecessors . That 's the new challenge that channel companies face in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than just the wrapping of a product . Its the smile that accompanies it . Starbucks first started writing first names on our coffees back in 2012 , a move that is as inexpensive as it is ingenious . They were early in their appreciation of the importance of individualized service a key driver of a positive experience for millennials . <p> Millennials treasure their individuality . Not that boomers and Gen Xers do n't  , but their sense of identity is more acute . In part , this is a reaction to the broadening of their peer groups and communities . But this refined sense of self means that millennials do n't  like being treated as one of many . Quite the opposite . They seek and expect personalized service from the brands with which they interact . To achieve this , loyalty rewards should be tailored to the executives buying patterns and personality .

Sixty-two percent of millennials are more loyal to brands that communicate with them via social media , according to data from Elite Dailys Millennial Consumer Study .

It does n't  entice a potential customer into a purchase . Instead , by entertaining its reader , it inspires trust in , and familiarity with , the brand . With millennial IT decision-makers , trust and familiarity are the key routes to sales . <p> While this represents a major shift in the communications strategy in many channel companies , it is an important one . Trust is vital to substantiate interactions with millennials . The good news is that , once a company earns a millennials trust and loyalty , it is n't easily lost . In fact , millennials are incredibly loyal to brands : More than half count themselves as extremely or quite loyal to their favorite products , says the same Elite Daily survey . <p> Despite their avid use of product research and third-party reviews , social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image . Once again , we see the critical importance of social medias role in influencing millennial behavior . <p> Loyalty , though , can be impeded by millennials impatience when it comes to dealing with technology . They are not only technology-native , they are technology reliant . They presume technology will work well and quickly . If a technology-rendered service does n't  perform , they will happily move to another one . <p> This raises the benefit of a channel provider assembling an omnichannel solution holistic and interoperable service offerings that work on different devices and in different locations . Channel companies should consider omnichannel arrangements to appease their millennial customers . <p> And , they should move fast . Like any disruption , the emergence of millennial decision-makers is creating opportunities for channel companies to differentiate themselves competitively . But high inherent loyalty among millennials means sticky customer retention .

( Not familiar with HCI ? See my write-up here . ) <p> In fact , a recent study from TechTarget Research identified HCI as one of the top two technology " momentum drivers " for data-center owners , just behind hybrid cloud . Close to half of current HCI users say theyve reduced costs . <p> What does that mean for the channel ? <p> Because hyperconverged systems are based on industry-standard servers , some partners worry that profitability will not match traditional storage offerings . That neednt be the case , and here are five reasons why partners can safely expect HCI profitability to compare favorably with conventional storage arrays . <p> Reason #1 : HCI sales cycles are 4x faster than classic storage . <p> Most buyers expect a traditional storage array to sit unchanged for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to align unknowable future needs with todays budget realities . With HCI , users can start small and scale out with future-proofed designs . With more flexibility and lower entry costs , I see deals getting done in 60-90 days , with a repeat buy pattern that cements ongoing customer purchases and partner loyalty over time . <p> Reason #2 : HCI consolidates partner training time and cost . <p> Hyperconverged systems do n't  simply integrate servers and scale-out storage . HCI also consolidates partner training time since management of servers and scale-out storage is based on widely used ( or popular ) server- and **25;405;TOOLONG tools . And , most HCI offerings are available from multiple server vendors , so partners can offer customers a choice of suppliers without introducing new user interfaces or management silos . <p> Reason #3 : HCI introduces value-added data protection services . <p> While standalone server sales deliver limited services and support revenues , you can make the case for a services contract to support virtual environments running mission-critical applications with high-value data . I see new opportunities to introduce value-added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reason #4 : HCI helps maximize partner program dollars . <p> Partners looking to maximize market development dollars can use HCI to drive programs supported by their largest partners . By adding HCI to a line card , you can expand the size and scope of registered deals with both existing server suppliers and newer HCI vendors . This is an excellent hedge strategy for partners looking to counter the shrinking legacy enterprise storage market . <p> Reason #5 : HCI may lower the cost of delivering support . <p> HCI systems minimize the risk of misconfiguration because of their flexible scale-out design . They also minimize performance risk because they make flash affordable . A growing number of HCI systems are already all-flash , further eliminating upfront configuration time , minimizing on-site performance tuning and improving customer satisfaction . <p> John Naisbitt , a long-time business analyst , once said , " Leadership involves finding a parade and getting in front of it .

The upside : Partners will get broader access to products under the Synnex roof . The downside : Consolidation among distributors means fewer to choose from and less competition for resellers business . <p> Nevertheless , that 's the way the industry is moving , and barring any regulatory or other issues , the transaction is slated to close by the end of the second quarter . <p> Channel Partners : What do resellers need to know about this transaction ? <p> Bob Stegner : One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see any changes until it closes . And even then the changes will be minimal because we 're going to keep- the businesses- separate for a while . <p> So the exact same people that you 're dealing with now , you 'll be dealing with after the close too . <p> BS : One of the big things is our operational expertise , which we 're good at , but also our customers and Westcon-Comstor 's customers will have the ability to work with other vendors . <p> For our customers , that will open up Cisco , Juniper , F5 , Palo Alto <p> CP : The most net new vendors are in security Blue Coat , Check Point , FireEye , Fortinet and Symantec " as opposed to networking and UCC . What really stands out is that Cisco looks like a new vendor relationship for Synnex . <p> BS : Symantec and Avaya this acquisition will enhance our relationship with them . It 's a perfect match for the two companies ( Synnex and Westcon-Comstor ) because there 's very little crossover . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the servers and storage business , and that makes it complementary to Westcon-Comstor 's security , UCC and networking business . <p> We have a security practice already but with the vendors that Westcon-Comstor brings to the table , it makes it even stronger . Same thing for UCC ; we did play in that market but this acquisition will strengthen it . <p> And networking if you look at it , we did n't have Cisco , so this gives us a strong line card . We 're looking forward to seeing the Westcon-Comstor customers ( resellers ) doing Cisco business continue that relationship , being able to offer those customers additional resources and vendors . And more importantly , our customers now that are very strong Synnex customers that ca n't buy Cisco from us will be able to do so after the deal closes . <p> CP : So for Westcon-Comstor resellers , many of Synnex 's vendor relationships may be net new for them . <p> BS : It 's too early to tell- but most partners do n't rely on a single distributor . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " may have had Cisco , Avaya and Palo Alto products from Westcon-Comstor for years ; we just do n't know yet . <p> CP : So prior to this pending acquisition of Westcon-Comstor , how would you have described Synnex 's business strategy ? <p> BS : If you look at the acquisitions we 've made and some of the programs we 've put together , this has not changed our strategic position at all . Synnex President ad CEO Kevin Murai- set the strategy some time ago and this is just another piece of our puzzle . And if you look at it , it 's also the recognition of consolidation in the distribution marketplace . <p> CP : Do you know how much overlap there is between Synnex customers and Westcon-Comstor customers ? <p> BS : No , I have no idea , yet . <p> CP : What would you like your resellers to know ? And , the annual Synnex Inspire Conference is October 4-6 , in Greenville , South Carolina . Can partners expect to hear more about this acquisition ? <p> BS : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's important because Peter Larocque president , NA distribution at Synnex said his team is revamping the conference for the pavilion so we can bring in the new vendors and also for additional hotel rooms for Westcon-Comstor customers , associates and vendors . <p> I 'm moving on that right now . They 'll absolutely be invited as long as we close , and they 'll be a great opportunity to meet executives , etc . <p> CP : With the acquisition , there will also be market expansion opportunity for resellers , right ? <p> BS : Yes . We bought the Americas business " - North America and Latin America " - as well , and that includes 14 countries . We 're in Latin America a little bit with Concentrix , but this puts us in a good position . Also , the 10 percent- equity in the international side of Westcon " - that will also help our customers because it will give them a global footprint . <p> CP : What about new services opportunities for partners ? <p> BS : I believe there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There might be some that we offer and they do n't and vice versa . There also may be services that one of us has that the other can enhance . <p> Ultimately , I think this acquisition is good for partners because , using a shopping analogy , they 'll be able to fill up their cart with more of the items that they need without having to go to two or three stores . It 's also an easier way to do business versus dealing with multiple sources to fulfill their needs . 193521 @qwx393521

@@37500735 @6500735/ <p> Channel Partners sat down with John Engates , Rackspace 's chief technology officer , and Bryan Thompson , general manager for the Rackspace OpenStack Private Cloud , to discuss partner reception of the company 's managed OpenStack as a service offering , the resurgence in private cloud , a new hardware deal with Dell EMC and the outlook for open source for enterprise customers . <p> Along with NASA , Rackspace invented- OpenStack in 2010 . Today it has the industry 's largest OpenStack cloud and more than- one billion hours of OpenStack server experience . Since it turned the project over to the open source community , the stack has seen phenomenal growth , and not just in hyperscale data centers : The April 2017 OpenStack user survey , spanning more than 1,300 companies in 78 countries , showed 32 percent of respondents have 10,000 employees or more , while 25 percent have fewer than 100 . And once a customer adopts OpenStack , they tend to expand . The median user runs 61 percent to 80 percent of its infrastructure on OpenStack ; among users with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs 81 percent to 100 percent of the overall infrastructure on OpenStack . Two thirds are production workloads <p> Among Rackspace announcements at the events were- a deal to deliver OpenStack- private clouds as a service running on Dell EMC compute and storage hardware . Customers may also- choose gear from HPE or the Open Compute Project . <p> Rackspace also recently announced an expansion of its professional services to support customers looking to- move workloads into AWS . That follows being named the first managed services support partner for Google Cloud Platform. ad <p> The company 's Rackspace Private Cloud powered by Red Hat offering , in which resellers can deliver OpenStack private clouds in a managed , as-a-service model , gained- new support options in March . Customers can choose to stay current on all new releases of OpenStack or select an every-third-release update cycle . Thompson stresses that Rackspace is not competing with the commercial Red Hat distribution ; rather , it 's providing Day 2 ? operations and has found that partners are being very successful selling the Red Hat OpenStack platform paired with that ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecosystem , " said Engates . While it took some time to figure out the right model , once we did , we put all of our fuel behind that model , and now the whole ecosystem is coming around to that way of thinking . " <p> Channel Partners:Congratulations on being voted Innovator of the Year . <p> Bryan Thompson : Its been a good couple day run for us . Its been exciting . <p> CP:What you 're saying at these events is , there 's a technical case and a business case for consuming OpenStack as a managed service vs. running it in house . <p> BT : Yes , we see huge demand from enterprises that are looking to 193520 @qwx393520 <p> consume it as a service , whether were hosting it or its in their data center , but having it delivered as a remotely managed platform . Cloud is still very complex " OpenStack is still very complex " and its not just about installing it , its those Day 2 operations . Were seeing huge value in being able to deliver that as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of that platform . <p> John Engates : When we started OpenStack , we assumed that we would roll out a group of consultants , go do the work and get it installed , back away and come back in only when the customer needed us . But we learned pretty quickly in those early deployments that every single one of them was different " we call them snowflakes . Every customer thought they knew what they wanted . <p> But in reality , while they would all be coming at it from different perspectives , ultimately they wanted the same thing " a cloud they could use . But they assumed that they had to bring all these requirements and all these expectations , just like they had done previously with enterprise software. ad <p> CP:The point of a cloud is to minimize snowflakes . <p> JE : Truth is , we found out pretty quickly the more of those snowflakes we deployed , the harder it was to keep them all moving forward in the OpenStack ecosystem . We were getting to the point where some werent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were too tightly integrated back to other systems in the company , or they were just so unique that they just werent in line with the community . <p> That 's what led us pretty early on to put a line in the sand and say , Were not going to do snowflakes anymore , were going to do these very systematized , automated deployments , they 're going to all look pretty much the same , they 're all going to be managed by Rackspace , there 's no walking away from it , were going to be hands-on forever. <p> CP:Both on premises and in your data center ? <p> JE : We jumped at the opportunity to do them both in customer premises and in our hosted data center . I mean , it was obvious we were going to do it in a Rackspace data center , but we were also seeing pretty early on that customers wanted something in their facilities , so we said , Let 's just leverage what we know about managing our public cloud , let 's leverage the work that we 've done on these initial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it into an option where customers can consume it wherever they want . ' <p> I mean , its news out there on the floor , its news up on the stage , but its something Rackspace has been doing for four-plus years now , almost five . <p> CP:Do you and your resellers run into hardware issues , where you come in and say , What do you have here ? ' <p> BT : Yeah , especially where they 're 193520 @qwx393520 <p> remotely managed , that becomes the challenge : How much different gear can you test and certify ? <p> Part of the value of OpenStack is being a bit abstracted . We rely on the underlying hardware operating systems themselves and their certification paths . So be it a Red Hat Linux enterprise-certified device or an Ubuntu-certified device , in most cases , as long as it meets one of those two hardware compatibility lists , were able to support it . <p> We are very opinionated from a reference architecture in how we configure networking , but were able to support a large swath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardware , do you issue guidance ? <p> BT : We have our- OpenStack Everywhere solution , where we have prescribed building materials that we can roll in from HPE or , as we announced earlier and moving forward , we have a full Dell EMC stack that we can provide . For customers that are looking for guidance , these are fully testified , certified stacks that we stand behind. ad <p> CP:How is your channel responding to the OpenStack managed service ? <p> BT : They can all resell hardware or subscriptions , but its that Day 2 that continues to be the real challenge for customers . Having a matched service offering that they can provide removes a lot of that complexity . That 's why there 's a lot of traction behind this with the Dell team . Theyre excited about it . <p> JE : Were involved in almost every opportunity ; were pulled in pretty quickly when a partner comes to the table with a customer . Its very much a sell-with engagement , in many cases . <p> CP:Do you see customers moving workloads between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> BT : It depends . Azure and Google Compute and AWS each have their own proprietary components . So customers will run an on-premises or hosted private cloud for certain workloads , but they may have defined it using SaltStack or Ansible or another orchestration tool . And they can use that same tooling and deploy to a public cloud with some environment tweaks . <p> For example , I can leverage AWS as the front end for certain things and call back over VPN into my core back-office systems in a private cloud . <p> For almost all of our customers- " and I think this is just the reality we live in- " its a multi-cloud world with a multivendor strategy . <p> JE : These clouds are n't  treated as interchangeable , generic pools of computing . They are usually built for a purpose , to solve a specific need within the company . Certain workloads are targeted , they have other groups within the company using public cloud for a variety of other things , so that tends to be how multi-cloud plays out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five clouds , but they 're using them for 193520 @qwx393520 <p> different purposes , and oftentimes they have different requirements and goals in mind . <p> They are n't  concerned about moving things back and forth . At one point , the academic thought was cloud as literally a generic pool of computing . Well , people do n't  do that . There 's no reason to move things that frequently or that arbitrarily . People build a platform , they layer things in on top , and then they do n't  want to touch it if they do n't  have to . And if they 're going to touch it , they want to do it with an automated toolset . They do n't  want to do it by hand anymore . <p> Multi-cloud is also slightly different than hybrid in the sense that some customers are using it as a multivendor strategy , where I can have a little bit of this and a little bit of that and make sure I keep all my vendors honest and that nobody is- gouging me on price . Maybe I wont be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benchmark workloads on each side a way to keep them all honest. ad <p> CP:Speaking of price , several companies here say they 've seen around 70 percent cost savings by moving back from public into private . Should partners be advising customers to run the numbers ? <p> BT : Absolutely . Maybe you have crazy swings of bursty workloads , in which case renting those spikes is more cost-effective . But at most organizations , a large percentage of their business units have persistent workloads , so you 're running at that consistent utilization . In a private cloud you can get much better economics . <p> JE : Youre paying a premium , to some extent , for all that flexibility . In the public cloud , you 've got a lot of elasticity that allows you to do a lot of things up and down . But a lot of companies do n't  need to go up and down to that extreme . That 's why Amazons had committed rates where you could pay in advance for reserved instances . Basically , youd buy a lot of capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I think private cloud is sort of the ultimate way to pay down your hourly fee : You just own the gear . <p> And for some companies , there are incentives to use capital dollars instead of operational expenditure dollars . Were owned now by a private equity firm , and what Ive learned meeting with lots of private equity portfolio companies is that they 're judged sometimes on EBITDA earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization and sometimes the EBITDA leans in the favor of using capital dollars instead of spending those operational dollars . <p> Sometimes there are just funky incentives inside of companies that push them toward just having their own gear and their own private clouds . <p> At a certain scale , it certainly makes sense . <p> CP:How do you see the value proposition of open source for your channel ? <p> JE : I 've been at Rackspace for 17 years , and we 've been big proponents of open source all the way through from the early days of Linux and creating OpenStack . Open source just keeps reinventing itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it just keeps growing into these enterprises . <p> Back then in the old days it was hard to convince a big enterprise to use Linux , it was like we were pushing a rock up the hill . <p> CP:People were sneaking the mail server onto it . <p> JE : Absolutely . Some Linux engineer would be working on it at home and bring it in . And now you 've got enterprises on stage saying Look what we built , look what we did , look what weve done. That 's just a testament to what open source is capable of . <p> Big companies like Google and Facebook and Amazon " there 's a litany " have proven that there 's nothing better out there at the scale . When you get to that point , there 's just no way to make the economics work if you 're going to pay big bucks for every license. ad <p> BT : Then there 's the innovation that comes from a global community as opposed to one vendor . <p> JE : Thats what I love about OpenStack . I mean , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear different viewpoints from Asia , from companies in China that are building their massive-scale public and private clouds . And then the telcos have come into the picture in a big way . <p> It all really just makes the product stronger and better and allows innovation to happen in a distributed manner rather than expecting one company , one vision , to drive it all . <p> This is one of those things where the power of the people seems to work . <p> CP:Should MSPs or customers worry about the embrace and extend ' phenomenon , where a vendor takes an open platform and then packs in proprietary stuff ? <p> BT : It goes back to the snowflake thing . I think there are enough vendors that realize that the minute I do that , Ive now forked this platform and I wont be able to keep up with the community " and then I own costs to maintain that . <p> JE : A lot of those have fallen out of OpenStack community . If you look at the names that are no longer here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong direction . From the very beginning we told ourselves we were going to stay as pure and as true to the community version as we possibly could , and to this day that 's the mantra internally at Rackspace. 193521 @qwx393521

Two years ago , the Commission adopted regulations that treat broadband as a telecommunications service , prohibit blocking and slowing down of Web content , and ban Internet providers from prioritizing certain traffic . <p> " The FCC , on a party-line vote , decided to impose a set of heavy-handed regulations upon the internet , " Pai said . " It decided to slap an old regulatory framework called Title II originally designed in the 1930s for the Ma Bell telephone monopoly upon thousands of Internet service providers , big and small . It decided to put the federal government at the center of the internet . Two years ago , I warned that we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Title II regulation would reduce investment in broadband infrastructure .

" Rolling back these rules or reducing the legal sustainability of the order will result in a worse internet for consumers and less innovation online . " <p> U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson , a Florida Democrat and member of the Senate Commerce Committee , issued a statement saying " gutting these rules robs Americans of protections that preserve their access to the open and free Internet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oversight of the broadband industry amounts to a dereliction of duty at a time when guaranteeing an open internet is more critical than ever , " he said . <p> Regarding BDS regulation , the order adopted by the Commission states that because of " substantial and growing " competition in the BDS market , legacy regulation " inhibits the investment required for the transition of BDS from legacy TDM networks to high-speed Ethernet connectivity . " <p> " Theres an allure , I 'll concede , to micromanaging prices , terms and conditions , " Pai said in a statement . " But hopes and good intentions cant override economic analysis and hard data . Micromanagement can thwart competition . It can stifle investment . It can prevent us from ever achieving long-term results that benefit consumers .

As trusted advisers , its our job to deliver a reality check , effective tools and advice to help customers- navigate conflicting requirements- among state , federal and international laws . <p> On May 25 , 2018 , GDPR will be in full effect . It requires any company- that houses data on an EU citizen , even if the company is not based in Europe , to adhere to the new regulations or face lawsuits and fines that can go as high as 4- percent of annual turnover- " that is , gross revenue- " or G20 million , whichever is greater .

Should a breach occur , the company must report said breach within 72 hours , as well as disclose the impact of the breach ; specifically , the extent of accessed data and how the breach occurred . <p> Not only is this a much shorter timeline than other regulations , but it also places tremendous emphasis- on accurate and efficient incident response . Customers must be able to quickly perform analysis to validate and quantify whose records affected by the breach . <p> Sounds serious , and it is . Yet awareness of GDPR is low across the board , especially for midsize and small companies , even those based in the EU . Many are unaware of , or underestimate- the impact this regulation will have on their businesses and how it will ( or should ) change day-to-day operations .

A CDO has a significant role in setting strategies and guiding business operations to stay in compliance . In smaller organizations , this role is often a second " hat " to be worn by a CIO or CTO , a daunting undertaking for a- generalist IT executive who must now come to grips with how to deal with these stringent requirements . <p> Given the importance of this role , most organizations will not want to outsource this service to a third party , where the third party 's compliance could then be taken into question . Therefore , CDO will tend to be an in-house position. - Partners should reach out to affected customers and position themselves as trusted sources of advice on best practices.For example , companies should be working now to understand the breadth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that data is being used on a daily basis and how easily it can be ported to another organization and/or be wiped clean upon citizen request . The company , typically via the CDO , must liaison with each EU countrys authorities to track , manage and report on how data is being handled . They must have a process and contact to disclose breach details should unauthorized access occur . <p> Work does not stop once GDPR goes into effect , as other directives will be added throughout the process . While the intention is that this regulation is to apply uniformly across the EU , my take is that GDPR will end up going through a series of clarifications , and there will be an opportunity for each country to " interpret " the rules- " - especially what must be reported post breach , and when . Therefore , to prove that data privacy regulations are taken seriously , companies must have a- living and detailed implementation plan demonstrating a path to compliance , even if finalization of GDPR extends beyond May 2018 . <p> Guidance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be extremely helpful to multinationals that are headquartered outside the EU , yet maintain sales offices . U.S. companies with no EU presence , but that hold EU citizen data , must fully comply with GDPR .

An expert who can advise on best practices to implement systems and processes that allow an organization to meet these challenges will have great influence .

A series of headline-making breaches like those at MySpace , LinkedIn , Friend Finder Network and Mossack Fonseca have proven that hackers are currently beating organizations in the field of data protection . In 2017 , the situation is unlikely to get better ; rather , we will see an increase in sophisticated attacks that force organizations to seek new ways to safeguard their businesses against growing cyber threats . <p> Netwrix Corporation , the first vendor to introduce a visibility and governance platform for hybrid cloud security , looks at the cybersecurity trends and threat patterns that are most likely to affect organizations in 2017 : ad <p> Connected systems and devices .

According to the Netwrix 2016 Cloud Security Survey , cloud is gaining traction , with the number of organizations using the technology increasing from 43% in 2015 to 68% in 2016 . However , growing volumes of sensitive data stored in the cloud will stimulate hackers to invent new ways to compromise IaaS and SaaS providers . Another disturbing trend will be a rise in DDoS attacks targeting cloud and hosting service providers , which are already called a " new ransomware " and may potentially make CISOs more reluctant to use cloud technologies . <p> State-sponsored attacks . Culprits backed by nation-states will remain a headache for governments and businesses alike , due to their ability to perform large-scale attacks without being noticed . State-sponsored hackers will use ever-more sophisticated techniques to sabotage elections , bring disorder to business operations and steal information about projects of national significance . <p> Machine learning . Machine learning has amazing potential in the cybersecurity field , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hackers as well as IT pros . While organizations will use machine learning as a tool to improve detection of anomalies in user behavior , generate threat predictions and remediate security issues , culprits may use its algorithms as a weapon to enhance social engineering attacks or perform vulnerability scanning . <p> New security regulations . The growing market demand for stronger security will force regulatory bodies to develop new compliance standards and legislations in response to the latest cybersecurity threats . At the same time , organizations will likely increase their use of self-regulatory procedures to regularly monitor their own adherence to standards . <p> " Critical infrastructures , cloud services and internet of things will be under severe pressure in 2017 , as cyber attacks continue to mature and expand , " said Michael Fimin , CEO and co-founder of Netwrix .

And an example of that would be , what does your partner quoting portal look like ? Does it support multi-site bulk uploads , multi-service including video diagrams and the like ? And it does . We went and developed that at the demand of the partner community . We 've invited them into the process and when they give us feedback , we move swiftly to go build the things that they 're asking for , and you cant do that without consistent senior executive engagement . So having the engagement like we do from Tony Thomas and Jeff Howe ( Windstreams executive vice president of enterprise sales ) , its pretty critical to run a successful program. ad <p> CP : What will be the process and timeline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our message to our partners is from day one its business as usual . We want our partners to continue to work with their existing channel team using the existing channel tools and process , and nothing different . And were going to spend the first 100 days getting the two programs combined and integrated so that we can enjoy the best of what both programs have to offer . But there are still some things that were sorting out . Were going to move as fast as we can and well communicate actively and often , but it will take 50 , 75 to 100 days before all that 's done . So business as usual today and integrated program by mid-summer . <p> CP : Have partners expressed any concerns about how existing client relationships , contracts , etc. , will be impacted ? <p> OS : There are partners that have contracts with both providers and in each particular instance , well just 193520 @qwx393520 <p> urge our partners and guide them to leverage the relationship and the contract , and the product that matches the customers needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then you 'll leverage whichever one matches the products that the customer is using . Again , that 's day one , and then in the first 100 days well integrate this . <p> CP : Beyond day one , how will you be engaging with partners on a daily basis ? <p> OS : We want to hear from our partners . If partners have questions , be vocal and ask . Theyve all got channel managers ; there are a lot of resources aimed at the channel . Were creating forums for partners to provide their input both to me and my bosses the senior executives up to , and including , Tony . So were soliciting that feedback and we do intend to communicate often . We do n't  want our partners to have to speculate about what 's in store , so well share information about the program as the integration efforts are under way . But there 's not a lot to share today , so I just say stay focused on business as usual , and as we integrate the two programs , well communicate . Theyre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and creating this and bringing it back out . Clearly you cant involve 1,000 partners , but you can certainly pick a couple dozen that are representative of the channel community and make them an active part of the programs creation and that 's what were doing . 193521 @qwx393521

" Cloud computing , which has gone from buzzword to one of the most prevalent terms in the industry in recent years , continues to generate studies and predictions from experts . <p> Here are just a few of the main cloud trends we noticed in 2016 . The topics vary from storage to security , just to name a couple of specific uses of the technology . Two of the studies we invoke are by CompTIA , and SkyKick talked exclusively to Channel Partners for this gallery . <h> Cloud Trends and Predictions : SMBs Backup and Storage <p> Survey data from Clutch found that SMBs are becoming more comfortable with cloud backup , with about 90 percent calling it on par with or better than onsite backup . <p> The company noted in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could expose them to security risks . One quarter of the respondents said they use free cloud storage in spite of security warnings ; 11 percent were taking care of sensitive banking information , and 14 percent were storing medical records . <h> Cloud Trends and Predictions : Contact Centers <p> Contact centers are taking their operations to the cloud , according to a study by 8+8 and CCNG . The survey found that 53 percent have made at least a partial move to the cloud , and another 20 percent plan on making the transition . <p> Channel partners should note that the two biggest concerns for companies implementing cloud-based contact centers were quality of service and security . <h> Cloud Trends and Predictions : Refinement <p> Multiple 2016 studies indicated that businesses are beginning to slow down and step back into a " refinement " step of cloud . CompTIAs 2016 Trends in Cloud Computing study found that the amount of companies using cloud in " full production " ( that is to say , business-critical ) decreased from 42 percent to 33 over the last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another CompTIA study gave readers pause about the impact of cloud on business . <p> The research organization reported a 26-point decrease in the amount of channel partners that view the cloud as " extremely positive . " One of the reasons for the decrease is the rise of SaaS solutions that end users may purchase directly without the help of a middleman . The company called the numbers a " reality check " and not necessarily a dismissal of cloud . <h> Cloud Trends and Predictions : A Lot of Choices <p> " We saw not only some M&amp;A activity and some other moves from the big players in that space , but we also saw the channel partners now faced with all of this choice , " he told Channel Partners . " Doing a lot more shopping around , trying to find the best deal , trying to find the best platform to build and evolve their practices . " <h> Cloud Trends and Predictions : Differentiation <p> SkyKicks Farrell said partners both those that were born in the cloud and those that are just now catching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive opportunity . <p> " We did a study earlier this year called " The State of the SMB Cloud , " and we found that ultimately 7.5 percent of SMBs have already moved to Office 365 .

" At the same time , seeing many partners out there some born in the cloud , some awakening to the opportunity in the last year there 's still this feeling among partners of , Were really challenged to figure out the best ways to compete and differentiate in this environment. " <h> Cloud Trends and Predictions : Crossing Lines <p> Farrell noted the " big scale IT providers " that are putting their resources behind cloud in new and expanded ways . Microsofts Cloud Solution Provider program is an example . <p> " It took a while for some of them to really get going , but now I think were going to see this battle for share that crosses lines that they did n't  necessarily traditionally cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have to be able to differentiate themselves not against the other IT partners but also against CDW , for example , or other large scale providers . " <h> Cloud Trends and Predictions : Standardization <p> Farrell predicted that partners will push for more standardization around cloud : <p> " What a lot of partners started telling us is , We see ourselves now needing to standardize and bet on ISVs , and in other cases , the marketplaces and the solution providers that give us what we need to grow and extend our business for the next few years . Were trying to evolve based on current revenue and other things. So they started pushing more to understand the story , to understand the vision , and we expect to see a lot more standardization on platforms . " 193521 @qwx393521

Since the turn of the Millennium , the multinational technology company dominated the market with its contact center , internet telephony , wireless data communications , and CRM software offerings . However , despite making 75 percent of its revenue off software and services in 2016 , its tardiness to enter the cloud space has ultimately led to the dire straits it finds itself in today . <p> But this bankruptcy filing is n't an omen of Avayas end . In fact , it can be seen as a new beginning . Avaya will now be able to restructure its debt so it can finally make the full shift from a hardware company to a software and services company an extremely strategic and tactical move . With this filing , it will seek to reduce its debt load of $6.3 billion , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can run its business with greater flexibility . <p> This will allow it to reinvest more into the areas of its business that matter most , like its contact-center solution . Despite the fact that were seeing many businesses move to cloud-based environments , there is still a place for on-premises systems . Long-tail customers with large , complex contact-center environments , like American Express and J.P . Morgan Chase , fall into this category . Avaya understands this , which is why it has publically announced that it wo n't sell its contact-center business . <p> However , while there is far less uncertainty around Avayas immediate future , it is still unknown how long this restructuring will take and how it will affect the company as a whole upon completion . As Avaya marches though Chapter 11 bankruptcy , there will be questions on what will be sold , how its overall business will be affected , and when the process will be completed . <p> Taking this into consideration , partners should focus on selling contact center as a service ( CCaaS ) during this time period . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its bankruptcy filing will incline both existing and prospective customers to switch their contact center over to a well-established CCaaS provider . Companies nearing the end-of-service contracts on heavily depreciated equipment will make up the majority of this group . <p> For these businesses , uncertainty will be the main driving force . They likely have cloud in mind for their future , so the uncertainty surrounding Avayas bankruptcy can enable partners to push them to make the move earlier than expected . Instead of renewing their contracts and purchasing new equipment , customers will be more inclined to choose the more cost-effective and future-proof option of CCaaS . With no hardware requirements , no cost or responsibility for testing , the ability to scale seats on demand , and automatically implemented upgrades , CCaaS will allow them to save money by shifting from a capex to an OpEx investment . <p> Leading CCaaS platforms also offer these businesses critical features they need now to interact with customers , like cross-channel integration of chat , video , and social media .

They also come with robust failover that allows contact centers to continue operating in periods of downtime . <p> Additionally , many CCaaS platforms offer robust reporting features hardware providers like Avaya cant match . Access to key performance metrics like customer satisfaction , conversion rate , and abandon rate aggregated across platforms helps call centers find weaknesses and strengthen them . Because of the increasing demand for a better customer experience , this will be a big selling point for businesses assessing new contact-center solutions . <p> To this point , weve already seen a few CCaaS providers respond aggressively to this news . That 's because they know that businesses today are increasingly demanding the scalability , flexibility and adaptability only a cloud-based contact center can provide . If partners do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is why it would be wise for them to speak with their customers using Avaya systems and start asking the following questions : ad <p> When does you contract with Avaya expire ? <p> Is your contact center hardware heavily depreciated ? <p> Have you considered moving to cloud-based offerings ? <p> Are you aware of the customer experience benefits a cloud-based contact center provides ? <p> Do you have failover in place to ensure your reps can work in periods of downtime ? <p> Are you interested in receiving real-time reporting on rep and customer activity ? <p> While Avaya works on stabilizing itself around its cloud-based contact center product , CCaaS leaders like inContact and Five9 will continue to add on to and refine their already stellar offerings . TBI has strong relationships with both of these companies , as well as other CCaaS providers , like 8+8 , RingCentral , Mitel and Vonage .

Now available with WatchGuard Total Security Suite ( TSS ) , TDR is the only security service on the market that pairs detection and response capabilities on the endpoint with a comprehensive set of industry-leading Unified Threat Management ( UTM ) network security services . <p> TDR Features and Benefits TDR further allows organizations to protect themselves from cyber threats by correlating events from their UTM appliances and their endpoints . This pinpoints malicious behaviors by using heuristics and threat intelligence , and scores them by risk and severity. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits : <p> ThreatSync provides real-time threat detection and policy-based automated response through cloud-based correlation and scoring . It consumes event data from Firebox appliances , Host Sensors on endpoints , and cloud threat intelligence feeds , correlates the data to generate comprehensive threat scores , and initiates automatic malware response tactics . This intelligent prioritization of each individual threat based on its overall level of risk ultimately allows organizations to decrease time to detection and remediation . <p> Lightweight Host Sensors extend organizations visibility and management to the endpoint by continuously scanning and monitoring security events on devices and sending them back to ThreatSync for analysis , scoring and remediation . Previously a frustrating security blind spot for most organizations , this constant flow of data from devices beyond the traditional network perimeter allows users to visualize and address endpoint threats . <p> " As a longtime WatchGuard customer , we are excited about how Threat Detection and Response has tightly and easily integrated with our 193520 @qwx393520 <p> network defense to add powerful correlation capabilities , " said Andre Bromes , SVP and CIO/CISO of Goodwill New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission is to empower individuals with disabilities , and other barriers to employment , to gain independence through the power of work .

Rushing to capitalize on this , new vendors are launching technologies in hopes of taking a piece of the pie . The collaboration space is a rapidly changing one and will only become more chaotic before it settles down . <p> Heres what I expect from the collaboration market in 2017 : <p> Goodbye , On-Prem : In 2013 , conferencing through the cloud was an early-adopter trend . Today , its the cornerstone of collaboration technologies for most businesses . On-premises deployments are dying , and we can thank Microsoft for hammering the last nail in the coffin . In the last couple of years , the company has systematically converted on-premises Exchange customers to Office365 and Skype for Business , showing the world that mission-critical tools can be run in the cloud . <p> ( Actual ) Unified Communications : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you name it . It will all join forces . Today , 77 percent of organizations work with multiple vendors for conferencing and collaboration . This is not a sustainable practice . Users can expect to see these technologies converge , with offerings from a wide selection of providers allowing every person and every conference room a full suite of capabilities right at their fingertips and at any scale . <p> Consumer UX in the Office : Consumer trends have been making waves in the workplace , which means meeting technologies will need to start matching consumer standards of BYOD-accessibility , flexibility and ease of use and be able to accommodate these elements on a much bigger scale . Whether the user is in a conference room or using a desktop , laptop or smartphone , collaboration technologies will have to provide a consistent experience and access to features like streaming and recording . <p> So what does this mean for the channel ? <p> Let 's be honest : The rapid rise of SaaS has left a good chunk of the channel in the lurch . The collaboration market is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and distributors are reluctant to give up on the high upfront gross margins of on-premises infrastructure . But the market has charted its course , and the channel will need to get on board . These teams might not be collecting the same sums up front , but with a SaaS model , they can reach 100 times as many customers . That should be a pretty big draw . <p> The delivery model and convergence of technologies are also prompting some AV integrators to question their relevance . Were willing to place our bets : Integrators wont fade into a distant sunset anytime soon . Customers are still reliant on relationships with their AV integrators or consulting firms , which means the channel bridges an important gap in the customer experience . <p> Through all the change , some things will stay the same .

" Those between the ages of 17 and 34 fall into this group , which has come to account for roughly 25 percent of the U.S. population . Millennials are growing both in size and economic power : Starting this year , they 're projected to spend a collective $200 billion annually . That 's one big reason MSPs need to start paying attention to this important target market , with a focus not only on how to market and sell to them , but also how to hire and work with them . <p> How can you help your clients make the shift to a millennial mindset , and at the same time learn how to adapt your business ? Here are a few things to keep in mind : <p> 1 . Retail Opportunity : For MSPs serving the retail vertical , mobile point-of-sale and payment strategies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are millennials , and merchant customers need to change the way they do business in order to better serve this growing population . Its also important to know that this tech-savvy market expects a retailers technology to work simply , quickly and intelligently . <p> What does this mean for MSPs ? Retailers are , by and large , behind the curve when it comes to implementing mobile commerce services . They need help with mobile app development , mobile devices for in-store use and with adopting technology that will give them a consolidated view of shopper profiles . An opportunity exists for MSPs to step in and fill these gaps . <p> 2 . The Customer Experience : SMBs also need MSP support with CRM and other solutions designed to provide a more personalized and memorable buyer experience . As customers , millennials demand and expect a personal touch , more so than other age groups . They also want self-service options . In fact , no matter what line of business your clients may be in , a greater share of the buying experience now happens online , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the changing market . <p> As trusted advisers , MSPs are in position to help their SMB customers find the solutions they need , whether its CRM or other tools , to address these demands , while using technology to build customer trust and brand loyalty . <p> 3 . Find Out What Matters to Millennials : Researchers say that millennials will make up 75 percent of the workforce within 10 years . For successful hiring practices , MSPs now have a mandate to put effort into learning what matters to this group . The reality is , many businesses are already failing at this . A recent Deloitte study reported that 44 percent of millennials were ready to leave their jobs within two years , and two-thirds planned to do so by 2020 . <p> MSPs should make note that millennials are more focused on people , products and purpose and less focused on profits . A few tips to consider when hiring this age group : <p> Do n't  Overthink : Every generation appears on the surface to be different from the last , but in truth there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the 1960s-era hippies became the Wall Street wizards of the 1980s . The grunge generation of the 1990s eventually morphed into experts in the Internet economy . <p> Mind Work Preferences : Millennials like change and want to avoid stagnation . To retain them for the long term , keep them engaged through new-skills training and new career-development opportunities . Millennials also value work-life balance . Figure out how to keep hours flexible and allow employees to telecommute . Do n't  force them to fit into a traditional schedule if at all possible . <p> Communicate : Millennials were raised with smartphones and tablets , so be sure to take advantage of their technology skills . And while they use email , its not their first choice ; text messaging is their go-to channel . So consider all of the alternatives when it comes to best communicating with them . Also , they believe in social media and will use it for buying , selling , crowdsourcing and , of course , socializing . Always set boundaries as an employer regarding social media use on the job , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their expertise and perspectives . <p> The bottom line is if you 're to succeed as a business , millennials will play a role in that success . They continue to make up a greater share of the buying market , and a greater percentage of your new recruits .

" Honestly , these poor shmucks have been on the ropes for so long , the death watch has given rise to an entire industry feeding on scare tactics . No doubt a few of your CIO customers have slipped off to self-help seminars in hopes of networking , meeting recruiters and learning how they can save their jobs from the proverbial death by cloud , or just from the IT budget being given to the CMO . <p> Ive been to a few of these conferences . The typical format is a panel of " experts " discussing how the CIO role is quickly fading and how their product is going to breathe new life into a doomed career . Give me a break . Never happens . <p> Now , that does n't  mean there 's no hope . In fact , as a channel professional who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're in an ideal position to coach them on how to revitalize their roles and , in the process , increase your value . In this column I 'll make the case that being proactive about discovering new and innovative technologies can transform a CIO into not just a company leader but an industry maverick , and I 'll discuss how you as a channel professional can facilitate and benefit . The process is pretty straightforward . <p> 1 . Mentor a startup : Its a leap of faith to spend money with an unproven vendor , arguably more so to add one to your line card . Its much simpler to brush them off and look for a similar offering from an established supplier . <p> But ask yourself : As an industry decision-maker , do you understand the journey that startup went through to get to product stage ? I bet you do n't  . Check out this list of 10 hot channel-friendly startups , for example . Yes , you likely understand the problems they are looking to solve . But how did they get from that first line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As many channel execs know , the journey of an entrepreneur is full of pitfalls . One of the largest struggles a tech startup faces is the dreaded task of finding a product market fit . You can help these companies bypass that headache . The payoff for you is a front row seat to the development and growth of the company , deep insight into the product and the ability to share feedback , maybe even shape the offering to what your customers need . Your CIO customers get the same benefits , plus great networking ops . <p> here 's how : <p> Identify a space that you have little knowledge about , but wish you did think bots , machine learning , Bitcoin , Blockchain , digital storefronts or security . <p> Identify a customer that might benefit from that technology . <p> Reach out to a VC , a media source or an independent firm , like my company , SwarmSales , and ask what startups are trending in this space . Note that a VC will most likely be biased toward its portfolio companies vs. industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagements with end clients . <p> Engage , not organizationally , but personally . Listen to the elevator pitch . Do a site visit and ask questions . Learn . You or a CIO can leverage a mentorship engagement document that allows you to set expectations , including not committing to a commercial purchase . The startup gets a better understanding of how a large enterprise functions or what a channel partner is looking for ( believe me , they need the help ) as well as how you typically make a decision or solve business problems . Email me at info@swarmsales.com and I will share a copy of the agreement with you . <p> Lastly , ask the startup to summarize how it would solve your customers problem and identify what resources they would leverage , as well as articulate to you the internal build process from their side . <p> 2 . Co-build a product . What 's your response when a startup comes to you or a customer and makes a statement like , " We can displace Tableau , and we can do it for cheaper ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of emerging companies what a disastrous strategy that is . They might as well go ahead and say they have no idea how enterprises operate . Our advice to these companies is , instead of going to the market with a fully baked product , engage early . Ask to co-build a use case . There are several benefits to the CIO , the partner exec and the startup . It produces a real-life customer use case , not a hypothetical scenario . The startup is now solving a business problem for you on their dime , and if they are successful , they will have a referenceable client and enormous validation which in return will help them raise capital , ramp up marketing , create a case study , work out the kinks in the product and be enterprise ready . <p> The main challenge that a CIO or partner faces is to make sure the use case you are helping the startup build is repeatable and scalable . This is where you need to make sure your moral compass is true and you 're truly helping solve an industry-wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " No one ever loses their job for picking IBM , Oracle or Microsoft . " Ever heard that saying ? Actually that used to be true , but its no longer the case . As the big companies of the world struggle to catch up to trending initiatives in the market cloud is a great example they are generally behind in driving innovation . <p> Do n't  believe me ? Go invite one of the larger companies to participate in a discussion on your newfound area of expertise . They will throw the best industry experts your way , analysts with big titles who will come in and discuss the trend and the impetus behind what is driving this movement . But the truth is , they rarely have a productized approach that you can leverage out of the box . <p> Why ? Most of them are waiting for those beleaguered enterprise CIOs to drive product demand and essentially co-build their solution . We often notice that emerging tech firms are way faster and better equipped to provide a productized approach and are agile enough to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RFP or an RFI , task your team to invite at least one emerging tech company to the bake-off . <p> Finally , think about the emerging trend of channel partners developing their own intellectual property . There are a ton of startups with great ideas that are perfect acquisition targets . It might be less expensive to acquire a company that is building a solution than to develop in house . I help with this sort of deal all the time . <p> Smart partners and CIOs are already keeping tabs on the startup scene . But formalizing the process , possibly making it a quarterly routine , makes you fundamentally stronger as a technology leaders and keeps your brand fresh . <p> Look , you have customer CIOs who wake up every day thinking only about how to keep the data-center lights on . Their days are probably numbered , and it might be time to make friends with that CMO . But those who want to embrace no , lead the change and truly drive innovation should look to startups . That 's where the next wave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swamped by it . Your choice . 193521 @qwx393521

@@37500803 @6500803/ 193519 @qwx393519 <h> article <h> WebRTC : A Differentiator and Revenue Generator <p> WebRTC ( web real-time communications ) is poised to be a business disruptor . WebRTC is an open framework that provides browsers and mobile applications real-time communications capabilities , such as voice calls , video conferencing , instant messaging , file sharing and business applications and is as easy as using APIs . Its open and its free . <p> There 's a ton of vendor support and platforms for developers . However , its the big names that we should watch : Google , Microsoft , and AWS . A quick trip down memory lane reminds us that just about five years ago it was Google that put WebRTC in Chrome and opened the technology to developers to go out and create voice and video applications on the web . <p> In fact , the WebRTC initiative is a project supported by Google , Mozilla and Opera , among others . Its mission : To enable rich , high-quality RTC applications to be developed for the browser , mobile platforms , and IoT devices , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protocols . <p> We caught up with a few of them for insight about WebRTC , its potential to be a differentiator in a partners businesses and , more importantly , a customer and revenue generator . <p> Channel Partners : Why do partners need to know about WebRTC ? <p> Michael Bremmer : Technology is always evolving , but the change is exponentially faster now and is destroying old business models . Saving a customer money used to be a great business plan , but the market killed the margin , so you have to create unique value now . <p> WebRTC is just the latest step in this process , but what 's different now is you have to create unique business value for your customers if you expect to stay in business . Customers expect things to just work and theyll pay for productivity gains because they 're under the same pressure as you , to create more value and eliminate waste their customers will not pay for . <p> WebRTC creates a sticky , interesting conversation because it does exactly that . <p> Alan Rihm : Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion by 2022 ( a CAGR of more than 23 percent ) , channel partners need to know how new technology , such as voice , video and collaboration tools , can help their customers . They need to know the what and the why of WebRTC , but just as important why their customers already care . <p> Embedded communications will be everywhere in the obvious applications like hosted PBX and VoIP , but also in business applications like CRM for sales , support , and much more . WebRTC makes it easy to embed communications in the process when and where the customers want it making it almost invisible yet extremely critical to the customers journey and experience . <p> CP : How about some examples of what WebRTC looks like in the real world ? <p> MB : For example , WebRTC is the link between Google Apps and Salesforce , connecting your Google Calendar , automatically filling in the address for a customer , then Google will automatically create drive plan using Waze , reminding you to leave 45 minutes before you thought you needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the link between your VOIP app , automatically logging calls , reminding you to create a follow up task in your CRM and queuing up the next call for you . We 've also used WebRTC with mobile geofencing to create a virtual in/out board for a large clients call center , allowing the employees to no longer have to remember to update their status because its done for them . <p> Dean Manzoori : The web today is a growing universe of interlinked web pages and apps , teeming with videos , photos and interactive content . Over time , web technologies have evolved to bring new generations of useful and immersive web experiences . Yet , there is virtually no high-quality , enterprise-grade service available that enables real-time communications natively from a web browser to existing unified communications ( UC ) platforms without the need for a plug-in . <p> WebRTC is about to change this . Leveraging WebRTC service , providers may now transform their customers web pages into real-time communications portals . Visitors of such WebRTC-enabled websites may reach their person of interest directly from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources on existing legacy UC infrastructure directly from the browser bypassing the public switched telephone network ( PSTN ) . Visitors are no longer forced to write down the phone number and use their phone to call . What 's more , the companys cost of communicating with such visitors leveraging WebRTC is a fraction of the cost of the same visitor calling a toll-free number . <p> CP : So WebRTC has caught a partners attention , now what ? <p> AR : Since the majority of our partners are not software or infrastructure experts , they benefit from the expertise platform providers bring to the table and how we can help them deliver value to their customers . From suggestions on product enhancements , to integrations and standalone applications , we always look to help them understand the possibilities , as well as get their ideas on where to take the technology next . <p> DM : As a service provider , we 've simplified deploying the Visual Automated Attendant ( VAA ) for our cloud communications customers . We 've already built the back end using both Broadsoft APIs as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud communications customers without the need for software developers . A business admin can easily create a directory , associate it with a button , automatically generate JavaScript Embed Code , copy/paste the code onto their website , and they have the solution deployed on their website . <p> CP : Is WebRTC something for every partner or is there a particular partner profile that 's best suited to take advantage of WebRTC API integration ? <p> AR : Partners of all sizes can take advantage of WebRTC integrations ; however , small-to-midsize channel partners are particularly well positioned to bring the value to their SMB and SME customers quickly and efficiently . They tend to be smaller and more nimble , and go from 0-60 much faster . <p> MB : Strategic partners need to be having these conversations with customers or risk losing the best opportunities to those of us who are . We do n't  do app development in-house as we leverage our masters and suppliers to understand their capabilities , which allow us to bring better opportunities to them . <p> AR : Delivering more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue opportunities for the channel . Especially recurring revenue opportunities since its through cloud software and services . Going forward , voice , video , chat , presence , and collaboration tools will be delivered as a monthly subscription service by the channel to the end customers . And since all of this is just another application on the network , the channel is perfectly situated to service and support customers of all shapes and sizes . 193521 @qwx393521 
@@37500804 @6500804/ 193519 @qwx393519 <h> article <h> Armor Channel VP on AWS , Microsoft Azure and Shared Responsibility <p> You just helped a customer move an application to Azure or AWS . Think you and they are now on security easy street ? Not so , says Dan Mannion , VP of partners and alliances for Armor . <p> " I 've had a number of conversations about this with partners this past week , " Mannion told me . The shared-responsibility model published by both Microsoft and Amazon means that when you move an application to the cloud , the customer is still 100-percent accountable for securing the virtual machine , operating system , application and data , as well as the network ports through which customers and employees access that data . <p> Armor is in the business of creating a consistent security and compliance posture across public clouds and internal and colo infrastructure , and its Armor Anywhere was named a Hot Product at this years Black Hat conference . The company also made the 2016 Inc. list of the fastest-growing private U.S. companies . <p> I spoke with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy at Microsoft , about the companys small but growing partner program , products and how the channel can keep customer data safe in the cloud . here 's the interview , edited for length and clarity . <p> Channel Partners : Where is the security demarcation line in the cloud ? <p> Mannion : Theres a perception in the industry that when I move to the cloud , Microsoft is taking care of the security , or Amazon is taking care of the security . That 's unfortunately not the case . What they are guaranteeing the security of is their data centers , the role-based access that they put in place , the clearing of the individuals . They 're ensuring that the people that actually run the cloud are not going to get access to your customer data , your sensitive information. ad <p> But when you actually move your app and your workload to the cloud , you 're not inside of that cloud . Its kind of a misnomer you 're actually on top of the cloud . You 're sitting on top of a virtual machine that is running on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the app that you put there , the database you put there , and the network that accesses that , that 's all your responsibility to secure and to manage . <p> CP : How much awareness do you see among partners about where their responsibility extends to ? <p> DM : Some partners know and understand that , and that 's one of the first thing that they talk to the customer about . If they 're going to be a responsible partner and talk to the customer about the cloud journey , they 're going to explain 193520 @qwx393520 <p> to them , " Hey , there is this thing called a shared-responsibility model that requires us to help you get secure when you 're in the cloud . Here are the things that we suggest you do . " <p> There are other partners that I have talked to who , when we introduced this to them , theyve already moved customers to the cloud and they say , " Wait , no , I thought AWS was just secure . " <p> So theyve fallen into the same trap that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " When I go to the cloud , its more secure then where I am taking the customer from . " That is true to an extent , its true to the fact that the colo facility or the private data center that the customer may have been in is perhaps not as secure as a Tier 5 data center that AWS or Microsoft builds and manages . But they forget to mention , or they just do n't  know to mention , this whole shared-responsibility model , which requires you to secure everything on your own . <p> So you do get a little more security when you move to the cloud , but now the other metaphor I like to use is , " Youre swimming where the sharks are . The sharks go where the fish are , and the fish are now in the cloud . " <p> CP : What role are AWS and Microsoft playing in saying , " Hey , you still have some responsibility . " <p> DM : Amazon has had to be much more public about this . Microsoft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the worldwide public sector cloud business at Microsoft for three years , and I never proactively brought up a shared-responsibility model ; I just sold the fact that your current environment is less secure than the environment that you 're moving to , which is true. ad <p> What is more challenging is when customers say , " Hey , at least I knew the environment I was in and I was able to control how I secured it . Now I 'm moving to the cloud , I do n't  have the same level of control that I felt like I had in my own data center . Now I have to figure out how to secure something in the cloud where I have less control , and its a different set of challenges that I have to go solve . " <p> So even when a partner helps them go in eyes-wide-open , now they have a different set of challenges , yet they do n't  have the same access and control that they used to in an owned data center . <p> CP : Is patching more difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , patching is patching , so hopefully they 're doing that pretty regularly in their own environment , and they continue that practice in the cloud . That 's not as much of the issue . The issue is , you do n't  have the same 193520 @qwx393520 <p> control and optics at the OS/server and network levels as when you 're in your own environment . <p> CP : Is shared responsibility the same across different platforms ? <p> DM : Microsoft Azure and AWS are pretty much exactly the same . It basically states that from the virtual machine on up it is 100 percent the customers responsibility to secure and manage . <p> CP : Customers do perceive security benefits , though . Is a server in the cloud less likely to be hit by ransomware , for example ? <p> DM : I do n't  have any evidence that ransomware has hit workloads in the cloud . here 's the thing though : If someone wants to hit you , and they 're coming into your environment , and they know that you 're accessing data in the cloud , all they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , that server is not in a closet in their office , its over here in the cloud , now I access the server , I encrypt the server , I 've got you hit with ransomware . " <p> Its the same model , its just locating where the actual server exists . That server could exist in your own office , it could be in colo at Rackspace , or it could be in Microsoft . I still have to find that server to have ransomware work . <p> CP : Game changer if a cloud server is hit with ransomware ? <p> DM : It would be something that Azure and AWS would not be advertising . <p> If you look where AWS and Azure have their growth , theyve gained customers low-security workloads first . Over the last 10 years there 's been $12 billion of annual cloud growth from those two cloud platforms , but it is largely because customers are putting their toes in the water and saying , " OK , I am going to give you my front-facing website , which if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a bad thing because its all public-facing anyway . I 'm going to give you my dev test environment which has garbage data and no intellectual-property risk for me . I 'm going to give you my cold storage so instead of storing this on expensive hardware , I am going to store this up in the cloud , and I am just going to encrypt that stored information because I do n't  have to access it ; I 'm just doing it for compliance reasons . " <p> Now in order for Azure and AWS to continue to grow and this is why they have such an interest in Armor they have to convince customers that they can move those medium- and high-security workloads to the cloud , and to do that , they have to be clear about the shared-responsibility model and how the customer has to secure themselves . <p> So either A ) the customer goes out and buys a bunch of tools and figures out how to run a 24/7 security-center team securing stuff in Azure or AWS , or B ) they hire Armor because that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great segue to an overview of Armors partner program . <p> DM : We launched four new partner programs on July 1 , and we did a big set of announcements at the Microsoft WW Partner conference in Toronto in the middle of July and sponsored some events and had some Microsoft speakers . It was very productive for us . <p> The four partner programs we launched are pretty standard in the industry . One is around a referrals partner program , so that 's mainly adopted by security consultants that do n't  want to be in the business of managing and reselling security services ; they just want to refer us business when they are in those conversations and are hearing about the challenges that customers are facing . They refer us the business , we run the sales cycle , we win the deal , they get paid . <p> One of the things we found when I got here in January is that software companies , ISVs , that sell into regulated industries , really love Armor . In fact , seven in 10 of our largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we allow them to deliver a differentiated solution , a very secure and compliant platform solution to regulated industries like finance , health care , retail , nonprofit , state and local government , education. ad <p> Anytime you 're dealing with sensitive customer information which a lot of these apps have to do in order to deliver value to their customers they either have to build up the secure infrastructure themselves in a colo facility or they give that to Armor , and Armor is able to manage and run that . They can be about the business of developing better software solutions for their customers . <p> CP : Health-care companies are in crosshairs now . <p> DM : Absolutely . There is a website I started tracking which every two weeks comes out with 193520 @qwx393520 <p> another one to two dozen hacks that have successfully occurred at hospitals , medical centers . Its really bad , unfortunately . <p> CP : Do you see a partner opportunity in PCI compliance , especially for partners who work with midsize and small retailers lagging with PoS systems ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are over 300 different controls . Of those , 96 are actual tech controls , and Armor Complete environment checks the boxes on pretty much all of those . Customers can become PCI compliant more cost-effectively and more quickly . They do n't  have to certify all the people walking into the building . We also help customers in Azure or AWS get there much more cost effectively . <p> CP : What percent of sales are direct versus with a channel facilitator ? <p> DM : In January , 10 percent of sales were coming through the channel , and that was partly because the company had n't  invested the right amount of resources in it , but its also because the offering we had on the market was n't very channel-friendly . <p> Our new offering , Armor Anywhere , is a much more channel-friendly solution . There are thousands of partners that Amazon and Microsoft have convinced , and funded frankly , to help customers move to the cloud . At some point there 's a compliance and security conversation , and what the majority of these partners are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a 24/7 security operations team , they do n't  understand cybersecurity , they do n't  have the people to essentially construct a solution for these customer , and so they often just do n't  address it . <p> They often say , " Oh , do n't  worry , the cloud is secure " which we just talked about not being true or they say , " Oh , here 's that shared-responsibility model ; that 's gon na be your responsibility , you need to go figure that out . " ad <p> I 've talked to a lot of partners who say , " This whole concept of security is a show-stopper , it is usually what prevents us from continuing to migrate customers to the cloud because they start to get cold fee . They are scared about their security posture in the cloud . " <p> Then we come along with a solution that allows you to unlock those medium- and high-security workloads and continue the business of transforming that customer to a cloud-based business and moving those workloads into the cloud securely . <p> Look , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to figure out how to get out of the data-center management business because it is not core . It is a cost they should not be incurring . Now , how do I take advantage of the fact that Microsoft and AWS have invested so much money in building a scalable and highly cost-efficient cloud platform ? <p> One of the biggest hitches in the transformation is 193520 @qwx393520 <p> security . Frankly , that 's what got me to leave Microsoft . I spent three years selling government , health and education institutions around the world on the cloud , and every day I had a data privacy and data security conversation . I started to really understand how important this concept is , and then when I found Armor and Armor said , " Hey , were solving that data privacy and data security issue in the cloud . " <p> I realized , man that is a massive market opportunity , these guys have figured it out , I want to be a part of that . <p> CP : What 's your goal for share of sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DM : When I got here it was 10 percent . By the end of this year well be generating 20 percent of revenue through the channel ; a year from now I hope that 's 30-40 percent , and our ultimate goal is 60 percent within three years . <p> CP : What challenges do you foresee ? <p> DM : Partners cant find the security people . That 's why every partner now has a choice . They either buy the tools and construct the security posture on behalf of the customer , which is really hard because they cant find the people who know how to do that , or they come to a company like Armor that has productized all the right tools , and has the managed service behind it along with a 24/7 security operations center . <p> Customers cant hire the cybersecurity pros they need . That leaves them vulnerable . For partners , a mix of the right suppliers , smart hiring , in-house training and advanced techs can fill the gap . Learn how in this free Channel Partners report . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage the environment and mediate any threat actors that try to attack that environment . I love talking to an infrastructure partner who 's tried to do this . Theyve bought a logging system , theyve bought a SIEM , theyve tried to construct this on behalf of the customer and theyve failed . Then they see what we have to offer and they sign up right away . <p> CP : What are you hearing from partners ? <p> DM : What partners have told us is 193520 @qwx393520 <p> that we have offerings that address all of the high- and medium-security needs of a customer . It does n't  matter the industry , does n't  matter what set of apps or data they 're managing . That we can secure stuff in Azure , AWS , our own cloud , Rackspace or their own data center means the partner just has one vendor to work with . <p> CP : Do you favor partners with a security focus ? <p> DM : I want the partners that do have a security focus , and the partners that do n't  have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a go-to-market perspective is that the partners that do have a security focus are productive much more quickly than the partners who recognize this is a big opportunity and do n't  have any security people on staff . Its tough to have a security conversation with customers without security expertise . <p> What we are trying to build with those partners is an easy journey to take the customer down the path . Bring them to us , and well help you get through the sales cycle , and then you just manage the structure as you always have . 193521 @qwx393521

Local firms like Cryptzone , which got its start securing over-the-air communications to fighter jets , are taking a growing share of some $3.8 billion in VC funding that went to the sector in 2015 , and they 're bringing partners along for the ride . <p> On Tuesday , Cryptzone will formally announce an enhanced channel program that offers plan-ahead marketing development funds , where the company will invest in select pre-sales activities , as well as attractive margins , discounts and comprehensive sales and implementation support . The goal , says Gravel , is helping partners realize revenue quickly while providing advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to simplifying its messaging and educating partners , even those not currently selling security .

" <p> The program has three tiers Bronze , Silver and Gold with annual quotas ranging from $100,000 to $500,000 that Gravel says could be waived for the first year . While partners must commit time to education , the margins up to 35 percent for those in the top tier are generous , as are the variety of MDF options . <p> " Its an expensive program , but its expensive for a reason , " she says .

The typical customer will be a company with 100 or more employees , but in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product meets their needs . <h> Software-Defined Security <p> With Cryptzones AppGate , controls are user-centric , dynamic and mapped to the sensitivity of a given application or data set . This concept , called the " software-defined perimeter , " has been set up as a specification with a working group by the Cloud Security Alliance . <p> The idea is to wrap network permissions around each user . A variation of the concept is in development by Google , under the BeyondCorp moniker . <p> Under an SDP , files and applications are invisible to anyone not authorized to access them ; its essentially a no-trust network stack . It does n't  matter whether the applications and data are on a customers premises or in a public cloud . To gain access , a device must be running an agent and be authenticated as having rights to the asset . <p> " What that does is , it improves security , it also improves and dramatically simplifies compliance , and it helps with operational efficiency , " said Jason Garbis , VP of products for Cryptzone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network or IT team to provision access . We can help with that . " <p> Verizon is among the proponents of basing security on people and data , not a 193520 @qwx393520 <p> now-nonexistent perimeter . The carrier played a lead role at the Cloud Security Alliances SDP Hackathon at RSA 2016 and said it will monitor the public cloud infrastructure to see how well SDP is able to provide 100 percent uptime by combining the resources of multiple clouds . <p> With AppGate , partners can set up software-defined perimeter rules , much like you might provision a software-defined WAN link . As with brittle , fixed WANs , customers using VPNs for network access control are likely running into problems , especially if they use cloud-based applications such as Microsoft Office 365 extensively or have many mobile employees. ad <p> Garbis said AppGate picks up where the AWS security groups construct leaves off . With security groups , a customer or partner says , " these IP addresses can get to these servers . " <p> " The problem with that is that people are n't  IP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either simply open access to everyone in an office through a single perimeter IP address , or they try to tightly control access by granting on a case-by-case basis using rules , a labor-intensive process that reduces business agility . <p> With AppGate , access decisions are made quickly and in an automated fashion based on preset policies and data such as geolocation , time of day , permissions , whether up-to-date AV is running and other identity and device attributes . IT can be flagged if something out of the ordinary happens . <p> For partners , helping customers develop those policies is a services opportunity . <p> " You get a secure , encrypted network tunnel from your device to the gateway , which solves the remote-access problem and meets the concept of least privilege , " says Garbis . " I do n't  care where you are you could be in Starbucks or on the corporate network . I 'm still encrypting your traffic , and its still secure . <p> A partner would place the gateway in front of protected assets , whether on-premises or in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributes and , based on those findings and the defined policy , automatically makes a decision on user access . <h> Incentives Added <p> A free trial of AppGate XDP for AWS is now available ; once the software is downloaded , license activation is automatic , and technical support is available . <p> All partners have access to pre- and post-sales support and preferential pricing , but those able to offer advanced integration and support and that earn certifications can earn additional points and status . <p> Gravel says there are additional sales promotions and incentive funds for early movers through the rest of this year . Cryptzone will work with partners to present threat briefings and host events for potential customers . In October , the company which has more than 100 employees and upwards of 450 customers named Leo Taddeo as its chief security officer .

That 's what DSCI did when they launched New York . They did it 100 percent agent . That was before we bought them and that 's a model that we liked and were going to be employing in a similar fashion with the combined company . <p> CP : Has your competition changed through gaining a national audience ? <p> KB : Very much so . Its changed for two reasons . One is back in the day when we were a CLEC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional CLECs or very few of them , and were not a regional CLEC anymore . We refer to ourselves as a managed services carrier , which is a managed services provider but we like to say carrier because that speaks to our DNA from a services , support and infrastructure standpoint . So being a managed-services carrier , were competing against the UC companies , managed IT companies , as well as the classic carriers for complex , solution-oriented WAN architectures ( and ) data-center solutions . <p> So I view our competition today as a lot of these silo companies who are the UC-centric providers because that 's our largest area of growth , coming from managed services , which principally is UC and the managed IT . <p> CP : What 's ahead for your company in the coming year ? <p> KB : Were going to look to grow outside of our geography and even within our geography because we had n't  really been considered a competitive player in the UC and managed IT space in the past . Another example of that is we became a Tier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering underneath our ITx managed-service umbrella . So we provide licenses and we provide transition as well as ongoing service for our customers . <p> All of these pieces came together , so were really looking to execute on it and bring that out , and bring those solutions to the customers in the marketplace . Our goal is to really continue to execute on our plan to grow and become one of the dominant managed services , probably the largest managed services carrier in the country . <p> CP : What do you think your channel strategy will look like in three to five years ? <p> KB : This is our 19th year in business and we 've been channel-centric from the beginning . And there have always been three words that we use when it comes to the channel : simplicity , support and success . Simplicity is you 've got to make yourself easy to do business with . Support , you 've got to have an infrastructure to help them in all phases of the sales processes , and success means you have to help them be successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right price and executing on the customer life-cycle experience so that we keep and retain customers , we grow customers , and were able to go out and get new customers . So that 's always at the core of what were doing . <p> The product set may evolve and change I think it will stay under the basic umbrellas that we have of connectivity , cloud and continuity services , and in the cloud you have UC and managed IT services as predominant areas . So I think we have the foundation in place to grow and to be where the market needs to be today that 's first and foremost and the acquisition of DSCI put us in that position with the combination of the two companies . <p> Now what we need to do is stay with that market evolution and be a solution provider . We went away from being a transactional company . We did n't  want to be the pipe . And the acquisition with DSCI and other moves we 've made in the business along with SD-WAN have enabled us to be the solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 193521 @qwx393521

So what 's all the fuss about ? <p> The DOJ said in a letter to Congress that , since 2005 , the Internet Crime Complaint Center has received close to 7,700 complaints regarding ransomware . The cost ? About $57.6 million , including ransoms , costs of dealing with the attacks , and lost time and data . And that 's just what was reported . Plenty of organizations and individuals just pay the attackers . <p> New variants of the TeslaCrypt Trojan , known as v8 or v2.2.0 , represent one of the most alarming findings in the most recent Quick Heal Technologies Threat Report . These variants , just like the original TeslaCrypt ransomware , make their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images , spreadsheets , PowerPoint presentations and other files . It begins encrypting these files , converting them into an unreadable form that can be viewed only with the aid of a private key . And the only way to get this key is for the victim to pay a ransom . <p> What 's the best prevention ? Educate customer end users to never download attachments or click on suspicious links in emails received from unwanted or unexpected sources even if the sources look familiar . Also , they should n't respond to pop-up ads or alerts while visiting unfamiliar websites , and partners should be diligent about applying all necessary security updates and keeping automatic updates on . <p> Because TeslaCrypt targets data , the most crucial step is to perform regular backups , and not have the backup device continually directly connected to the end users PC or customer network . If you can access a backup device from a PC , so can the ransomware . Backup devices and/or tapes should ideally be kept offline when not being used . This can help partners restore data and eliminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is constant when it comes to security , suppliers are doing what they can about TeslaCrypt , while also looking intently at what may be just around the corner . Quick Heals research team has pinpointed Locky as one of the latest forms of ransomware to cause concern across global markets . <p> Like TeslaCrypt , Locky is a file-encrypting ransomware malware . After encrypting the files it finds in the PCs it infects , it then changes the extension of the encrypted files to . locky . The encrypted files can be decrypted only with a key available from the cyber thief , for a price . <p> Known to target Windows users , Locky uses spam email campaigns to spread and infect its victims . In one campaign , the email , which appeared to come from a popular organization , asks the user to download an invoice attachment ( a Microsoft Word doc ) .

@@37500825 @6500825/ 193519 @qwx393519 <h> blog <p> The key to successful channel sales is developing a mutually beneficial relationship between a supplier and its partners . A properly balanced program increases profit margins and adds value to the product offerings of everyone involved . <p> But how do you as a partner know when a vendor has such a program or , as a supplier , how do you build one ? <p> These four insights can help forge an ironclad channel partner program and build long-lasting business relationships . <p> No. 1 : See It From Their POV <p> One essential practice in a strong channel program is to consider things from the other side : Instead of having a mentality of " go out and sell my product , " you need to understand your partners business . <p> Ask : What is your partners value proposition to the end customer ? Then align your solutions with your partners portfolios . Otherwise , you 're trying to fit a square peg into a round hole as much as you may strive to give your partners everything they need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marketplace , the strategy is not a revenue-generating one . <p> This does not necessarily mean you need to create an individual , granular plan for each partner you work with . But you can build programs geared toward supporting the type of partner in a few key ways . <p> Messaging is an important part of this . You must understand your partners messaging and target your own in a way that accentuates your partners portfolio , thereby allowing the partner to strengthen its value proposition to its customers . <p> No. 2 : Add Value Through Support <p> Your channel partner is your customer , and you need to serve your customer in a way that allows the partner to be successful with its own customers . <p> Ensure your products seamlessly integrate with those in your partners solutions sets . The partner should be able to see that distributing your product strengthens and enhances its own value proposition to its customers . However , while quality products are vital to a channel program , partners also need to feel confident that a manufacturer can support them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solutions partnership survey found that more than half ( 55 percent ) of respondents said the reason they had chosen their current partners was because of support . <p> Therefore , you need to build a business case around other ways in which a partner would want to work with you . While you must show that you can make the partner more profitable , you must also demonstrate that you can give the partner the resources it needs to be successful . Think technical training , marketing development , targeted campaigns for customers , sales support and expertise in the field . <p> No. 3 : Understand the customers customer <p> When building out a structured channel sales program , keep in mind your partners go-to-market strategies and how they serve their customers . This will help you build systems that allow your partners to deliver your products effectively . For example , when my company , Vision Solutions , a software-as-a-service , disaster recovery and migration services provider , partners with global systems integrators , we understand that the SI will have different needs from a product-delivery standpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements of partner training and enablement will be the same . <p> To illustrate , the SI might need to deliver our services to customers in highly regulated verticals , such as the financial industry . For us to get software licenses to that kind of end customer , we need to configure our product portfolio and delivery mechanisms for the SI to ensure its in compliance during product delivery . <p> No. 4 : Always Ask for Feedback <p> Constantly solicit feedback from your distribution partners and , most importantly , listen and incorporate advice . Ask how the selling is going , whether they think the relationship is successful and how it could be improved . <p> The answers will vary , but any and all feedback is valuable . For example , a partner may say you need to improve your products because customer demand is decreasing , or that technology has moved beyond the old value proposition . This sounds negative , but you should look at this as a positive a way to always make better products and improve customer satisfaction . Weve gotten some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can improve our products and services , and , many times , those recommendations make their way into product updates . <p> Alternatively , negative feedback might reveal that you have not provided key information , a specific tool or proper training during a technical enablement . You then can take the opportunity to retrain and re-engage with your partner and improve their knowledge and understanding of the product . In the Vision Solutions partnership survey , almost nine out of 10 respondents ( 89 percent ) indicated that when selecting partnership programs , technical pre-sales and post-sales support was either " very important " or " important . " <p> Remember , sellers in the field are a valuable resource and have the power to help you improve everything from product development to delivery mechanisms . Partners often want to give that feedback , and soliciting and utilizing it is one of the greatest ways a manufacturer can maintain its relevance , demonstrate its commitment to its partners and evolve as a company . <p> Successful channel-partner programs are about more than just contracts and handshakes . They 're about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own profits , you also need to ensure you are always making your partners more successful with their own customers as well .

Available initially in the U.S. and Canada , the new service delivers a scale-out , network-attached storage ( NAS ) option for edge applications . It aims to solve the needs for demanding file-based replication requirements ; Avnet says its easily configured to serve the needs of remote offices and back offices for any size of business . <p> " Software-defined storage solutions are taking the market by storm , " said Eric Barnhart , vice president of Avnets EMC solutions business unit in the Americas . " They exponentially increase options available to IT professionals and provide enterprise-grade reliability and performance . These solutions also optimize cost by using industry-standard and commercially available servers .

" <p> Channel Partners sat down not only with Barnhart , but also a pair of other Avnet leaders John Tonthat , director of Marketing and Business Development , EMC Converged and Data Solutions ; and Doug Sobieski , financial services solution executive ; to discuss the awards , the new software-defined storage offering , Dells pending acquisition of EMC , and more. ad <p> Editors Note : The following has been edited for length and clarity . <p> Channel Partners : Avnet was just named EMCs distributor of the year for both North America and Latin America . That has to be a nice validation for what you 're doing . <p> Eric Barnhart : Were incredibly pleased and excited that to get those awards . Its certainly a validation of what we 've done . We really set our sights at the beginning of 2015 on engagement and alignment with EMCs go-to-market strategy around converged infrastructure , hyperclouds , and leading the transformation . Were fortunate that EMCs direction really mirrors Avnets overall vision , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional resources and people into the business particularly fueled technical , fueled resources that align with EMCs midmarket sales organization . And we 've developed tremendous relationships that have helped our partners 193520 @qwx393520 <p> get closer to their end users in alignment with EMC and VCE sales folks . This was absolutely a validation that that was the right strategy . Weve come a long way and are really pleased to have been acknowledged by EMC as the best and most effective distributor in 2015 , for sure . <p> CP : How is your relationship with EMC going to be impacted by the Dell acquisition ? Any real changes there ? <p> EB : The real change there is very positive . We have a relationship with Dell . Weve been Dells OEM distribution partner of the year for the last three years , which again validates the creative things we do around the supply chain with Dell . I believe Dell helps us fill out that converged infrastructure , hybrid cloud , modern data-center story ( this years EMC World theme ) pretty well with EMC . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this vision and around these capabilities and with Dell coming in and creating Dell Technologies with EMC , just enhances and really bolsters the opportunity for our partners to drive transformation for their customers . <p> CP : Talk about your new software-defined storage offering and how your partner base will benefit . <p> John Tonthat : So what was announced May 4 is a solution built by Avnet to help the Isilon business unit deploy IsilonSD Edge as an appliance . Essentially , IsilonSD Edge is a software-defined product from EMC that extends the capability of Isilon from the data center to the edge . I think that touches a couple of things : One is the significance of software-defined storage and how software-defined storage is consumed . Its a piece of software , it needs an Intel CPU to run , and from that perspective , we are able to integrate that solution into a Dell server running VMware . I think it solves a couple of things . From a technical perspective , it makes the consumption of software-defined storage a lot easier , and it allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software-defined more tangible and much easier to deploy . <p> Editors note : Avnet will incorporate its consumption-based financial service CapacityNow into the solution . It enables organizations , both commercial and government , to acquire technology through a flexible managed service . CapacityNow was developed as an alternative to traditional leasing and financing , where the user can now align their payments with actual usage . Sobieski explains further . <p> Doug Sobieski : Were facing the biggest shift the industry has seen in decades in how companies pay for technology . Historically people would pay cash . This is the biggest thing that has caught the industry sort of asleep at the wheel . Those of us in the equipment finance industry , we 've known this was coming since the 2005-2006 time frame , so we 've had one eye in the rearview mirror . Every partner is getting more and more calls from people asking about consumption models . They want to pay by the drip . However there is a change to lease accounting that on Nov. 11 of last year was voted on by the financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to where for fiscal years starting after Dec. 15 , 2018 , for public companies , and Dec. 15 , 2019 , for private companies , all leases regardless of structure have to be 193520 @qwx393520 <p> on the balance sheet . So for companies that prefer opex , leasing is now off the table . So there is a massive shift in people trying to understand these consumption models . <p> Fortunately , at Avnet , we knew this was coming years ago and we started and built from the ground up our consumption model , which is called CapacityNow . The most important aspect is the contract itself because people are getting hit from all sides with these consumption models and partners need to know that the contract is critical so that it does n't  trip some triggers that cause it to be , essentially , an embedded lease . We fully believe that we 've constructed something that will solve the opex riddle for companies that are looking to do that and we 've got the most transparent and friendly approach to how its priced . Our partners are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you 're aware of how these consumption models work , think of it in terms of your cellphone bill . You go into the cellphone store , you pick out a handset and say , " I want 10 gigs of data per month . If I go beyond that , I 'm going to pay " x " cents a gig for any overages , " and that resets on a monthly basis . So that 's essentially how it works . <p> CP : What 's one key takeaway for our audience as the new Dell Technologies era gets set to begin ? <p> JT : I would say if there 's one takeaway that I 'd like the audience to understand is that , in this new world between Dell and EMC , and now Dell Technologies , what you really need is a trusted advisor to help bridge the gap between EMC and Dell and to understand how the solution portfolio works . So clearly from a validation perspective , EMC recognizes our ability to do that . If there are partners out there who have questions about how to profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 193521 @qwx393521

That 's about 3,300 per day . Yes , you read that correctly per day . Neil is the executive who helped establish the Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor and who is now general manager of Azure . <p> The first question that comes to mind for many of you is , " How are all those new subscribers connecting to the cloud ? " <p> Previously , the answer likely was direct Internet access . This method was n't extremely secure , however , and there was associated latency . The Microsoft team responsible for Azure , which is typically consumed by midmarket to enterprise clients , listened to subscribers concerns about connectivity into the Azure cloud . They introduced ExpressRoute for Azure . <p> ExpressRoute comes in three distinct flavors : point-to-point , MPLS or direct connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Exchange Provider <p> Network Service Provider <p> Typical Connectivity Model <p> Connectivity at a Cloud Exchange <p> MPLS or point-to-point <p> Supported Bandwidths <p> 200 Mbps , 500 Mbps , 1 Gbps , 10 Gbps <p> 10 Mbps , 50 Mbps , 100 Mbps , 500 Mbps , 1Gbps <p> Routing <p> BGP sessions directly with customer edge routers <p> BGP sessions with carrier <h> Where Can My Customers Connect ? <p> There are approximately 10 domestic Azure cloud nodes , with two designated strictly for government cloud , and 12 international cloud nodes where clients can gain NSP ( network service provider ) connectivity . <h> The Who : Which NSPs and EXPs Offer an ExpressRoute connection ? <p> There are approximately 10 NSPs that offer ExpressRoute connections in the United States . Among them are AT&amp;T ( via NetBond ) , Aryaka , BT , CenturyLink , Comcast , Level 3 , Orange , Tata , Verizon and Zayo . Note that these providers do not offer service into all ExpressRoute locations . <p> As you move into the rest of the world , the NSP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mix . Alternatively , there are a number of domestic colocation providers that have become exchange service providers ( EXPs ) . These include but are n't  limited to Equinix , CoreSite and CyrusOne . <p> As an interesting side note , customers are actually re-architecting their topologies to gain proximity to the Azure Cloud for mission-critical applications such as Office365 . Were seeing clients stand up single racks , which are geographically dispersed , to create a redundant hybrid environment . <h> How Does It Work ? <p> We 've covered the " what " and " where . " Let 's look at the " how . " With ExpressRoute , the customer orders a dedicated circuit . With this circuit , they can establish a dedicated connection to the Microsoft Cloud . The diagram shows this type of setup : <p> The dedicated circuit has three distinct route paths . These are public , private and Microsoft . Microsoft ensures redundancy by configuring each circuit on a pair of active-active or load-balanced routers . Private peering into the Azure Cloud is established for compute . Public peering is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public IP . Customers can connect their extranets and all Azure services on their public IPs without the need to traverse the Internet . <h> What 's Next ? <p> Connecting circuits to the Azure platform is just the start . Were already starting to see the rollout of applications , such as Office 365 , that can be securely connected to the Azure cloud . <p> We believe the next three years will be groundbreaking in terms of the next-generation products and capabilities Microsoft will roll out . There will be parallels made to the time when Windows 95 , Windows 98 and NT 4.0 were released . Microsoft products will support development of a clients own applications as well as the transformation of legacy applications and data-management tools . Most industries will need several years to catch up to the capabilities which means now is the time for partners to get up to speed on how we can continue to be of value to our clients . <p> In our view , the simplicity of connecting to the Azure platform will enable clients to consume innovative tools and open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard operations as well as new services . All of this needs to be handled with a strategic approach that includes quantifiable goals . Clients will be measuring and monitoring the consumption of these technologies . Becoming versed in the Microsoft clouds capabilities will help you have the conversations that are going to matter more and more to your clients . <p> How ? The Azure platform will shift the conversation from fire drills and managing licenses . Instead , well be working with clients to develop policies and procedures ; work on recovery ; implement and administer security ; and manage voice , network and data with true authentication . From the SMB space to large enterprise , newfound capabilities will enable trusted advisers to shift their focus to areas that we literally have been dreaming of the past couple of years . <p> Leveraging a strategic approach , well be able to provide metrics that can be reported .

This constitutes the revenue PGRS will receive from closing deals with customers that span the next several years . According to PGRS , " We would not have closed these sales without having a partner like INetU that provides the hosting services ( technology ) , sophisticated security and industry certifications required by these customers . " <p> Since partnering with INetU , PGRS has been able to leverage the relationship as a key competitive advantage in marketing to new customers . " INetU has gone with us to niche events and spoken at our customer conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dillahunty . " Even during the RFP process , they will design a customized solution to fit the prospects needs and price point that we can offer . Then theyll often come with us and speak directly to potential customers about their managed hosting services . Making sure the customer is comfortable with your company and its vendor relationships is the biggest challenge in partnering with any third party on a proposal or contract negotiation , so having INetU available to provide that direct assurance is a huge benefit . We have never had an issue getting someone from INetU on the phone to discuss their services . Well even offer to let potential customers do a site visit to the INetU datacenter like we did its wonderful to have a partner that can stand in the foreground with us . " <p> The partnership does n't  stop once the deal is closed .

" Even though it was not their home-grown product , they were diligent about ensuring the problem our customer experienced got resolved .

" With the strict security standards in place these days , we would n't have even been able to respond to the customers RFPs that we 've won if it werent for INetU we would n't have met the requirements in the RFP , " said Dillahunty . " We want to continue to innovate and offer new customers what they want or need to host their applications before they even ask for it . And well use INetU for every one of those activities .

There 's plenty of room for competitors . Microsoft has emerged as a strong No. 2 with the Azure IaaS/PaaS combination , which it is now extending into private clouds via Azure Stack , a packaged version of Azure services that can be deployed in private data centers . The goal is to deliver a completely consistent hybrid cloud platform , regardless of where organizations choose to deploy their applications . <p> When Mike Neil , corporate VP of enterprise cloud at Microsoft , announced the initial Azure Stack technical preview , he made it clear that Microsoft wants customers to approach cloud as a model not a place . By " model , " Neils talking a hybrid cloud approach that delivers consistency across private , hosted and public clouds . <p> On the surface , Microsofts full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 RightScale State of the Cloud Report , 71 percent of respondents use hybrid-cloud environments , up 13 points from last year . Although a distant second in actual public-cloud adoption , more organizations show interest in Azure for future projects than any other platform . Microsofts strong channel structure is likely a factor for business respondents . <p> Unfortunately , there is n't a consistent industry definition and understanding of the term " private cloud . " Given the high response rates in the RightScale survey , we suspect most conflate " private cloud " with " virtualized infrastructure , " as in vSphere/vCenter or Microsoft System Center with Hyper-V , when in fact , realizing full benefits requires a self-service , multi-tenant system offering a selection of pay-as-you-go services , not just compute . <p> Microsoft clearly does n't  believe private clouds are a niche market , but rather an opportunity to be seized with the help of partners . <p> Heretofore , its private cloud story has been weak , with some Microsoft shops using System Center to manage virtual infrastructure and others experimenting with the now-obsolete Azure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Microsoft promises " the power of Azure in your data center " with the ability to deliver IaaS and eventually PaaS services identical to those available on public Azure . Its a compelling vision shared by VMware with vCloud and vCloud Air . However , each competes from different bases of strength : VMware within enterprise data centers and Microsoft in the public cloud . <p> Partners Need Skills <p> The biggest hurdles for partners looking to help customers implement the private side of a hybrid-cloud strategy are the complexity and expense of putting in place the required hardware and software . Cloud stacks are n't  simple to deploy , configure or administer . Furthermore , the fact that they 're designed for highly distributed and redundant infrastructure adds overhead in terms of managing workloads and requires careful hardware selection . While Azure Stack does simplify the software side , it still demands cloud management expertise and , as I found when attending a Microsoft-hosted hands-on Azure Stack workshop for analysts and journalists , has a serious learning curve . <p> Partners have an opportunity here , if they 're willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather keep off public IaaS . But it will require a lot more engineering chops than selling some Office 365 subscriptions and migrating email and Word and Excel files to Azure . <p> Indeed , like EVO:RAIL and Microsofts own Cloud Platform Standard , most Azure Stack buyers will buy the hardware as part of a pre-integrated , converged system , although Microsoft will publish a hardware compatibility list ( HCL ) for do-it-yourselfers . <p> I 'm focusing on the hardware to underscore the minimum level of cloud capacity a customer needs before Azure Stack makes sense . Organizations not running at least 200 simultaneous VMs and prepared to spend more than $100,000 on new hardware need not apply . For partners , this means Azure Stack must be positioned for large and midsize enterprises , possibly some smaller boutique shops with high-end needs ; think biopharma or financial services . General SMBs are best served either evolving to all public cloud or using an MSP for private workloads . <p> That said , Azure Stack should be a compelling option for large enough Microsoft shops , particularly those already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more intriguing partner opportunity for Azure Stack is targeting specific markets , whether industry verticals , underserved geographies or niche use cases , with tailored services by using Azure Stack as the foundation for your own set of cloud services . In fact , Microsoft expects service providers whether telcos , existing hosting MSPs or partners to be a significant market for Azure Stack . The Azure Resource Manager has been extended in Azure Stack with this in mind by adding features designed for businesses offering shared Azure services to customers . <p> Recommendations <p> Azure Stack holds promise for customers that have firmly committed to a true hybrid-cloud architecture , understand what that entails , and want the flexibility to easily spread workloads across both private and public infrastructure . That said , it will be most appealing to those that have built their private infrastructures on Windows Server , Microsoft System Center and Hyper-V , not vSphere shops . <p> Customers already using Azure IaaS and PaaS will love Azure Stack since there 's no learning curve , and applications built for public Azure can seamlessly move to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a compelling alternative to OpenStack with Cloud Foundry for greenfield private-cloud environments . Selling points : Its bit-compatible with the second-largest public cloud service ; its built and supported by a single , trusted vendor ; and its sure to be widely available and supported pre-integrated on hardware from similarly trusted vendors , like Dell and HPE . For partners in the business of managed hosting and applications , Azure Stack provides a ready-made platform for new cloud services designed for specific industries , use cases , regulatory requirements or individual customers that can be easily integrated with public Azure in situations requiring added capacity or Azure services think machine learning , HDInsight/Hadoop or IoT not yet ported to Azure Stack . <p> Kurt Marko is an IT industry analyst , consultant and regular contributor to a number of technology publications , pursuing his passion for communications after a varied career that has spanned virtually the entire high-tech food chain from chips to systems .

Many enterprise cloud applications can now be bought with a click , and that has empowered line-of-business users to select whatever best fits their needs leaving the burden on IT and partners to connect the dots between those applications and the rest of the enterprise . With SaaS applications replacing traditional on-premises infrastructure projects , SIs must now establish their worth to customers by excelling in cloud connectivity , providing critical , agile integration points between whatever apps happen to exist in the business ecosystem quickly and within budget . <p> SIs immediate reaction to this shift from on-prem to SaaS , generally , is trepidation or outright fear . But I challenge you to view it from another angle . When has there ever been a riper market for integration ? Every user of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trade data , and they expect it to be easy . The truth is , its still difficult to tie these apps together , especially when left to an overworked IT department that 's already fighting shadow IT . In fact , in a recent survey from Scribe and Spiceworks , 61 percent of IT professionals reported that they werent satisfied with their cloud-to-cloud integration capabilities , and 59 percent expressed dissatisfaction with their cloud-to on-premises integration capabilities . <p> As an SI , if you can stitch these apps together in short order , in a scalable fashion , you can be on the leading curve of the new capabilities people are looking for rather than seeing your competitors moving to this model and attempting to follow suit . <p> So how do you equip your teams to tackle these new challenges ? The first step is to standardize on an integration platform as a service ( iPaaS ) which Gartner defines as a suite of cloud services enabling development , execution and governance of integration flows connecting any combination of on-premises and cloud-based **28;620;TOOLONG and stick with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are on hand or write custom code for each job , but that increases the time it takes to deliver these integrations , and can therefore eat into your bottom line as well as hurt your standing with the customer . By finding an iPaaS that can accommodate your integration needs , you can teach your teams how to use one tool , and you can start to build IP around common integration scenarios using that same tool . Isnt it more appealing to build something one time , then re-use your work over and over ? You 'll also more quickly help your customers realize value in the integration you are building . <h> Strategic Use Cases for iPaaS : Building an Integration Library <p> That re-use of work is a key component that bears repeating . After selecting the right iPaaS , you can build an integration for a specific customer and re-use that same work when the opportunity arises for another customer , getting twice the " bang for your buck " out of the discovery and creation of these integration use-cases . The more solutions you create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of known and vetted integrations gets , allowing you to focus on the customization end of the design phase versus the initial knitting together of these apps . <p> As you leverage an iPaaS to build your integration library , you can allow your junior team members to tackle the task of setting up the baseline integration , freeing up your more senior team members to do the interesting " value-added " work . If you can keep the low complexity/high volume work out of your advanced team members hands , you can bill them out at what they are worth as well as keep them more engaged and stave off the boredom of doing the same menial tasks customer after customer . <p> So how do you pick an iPaaS tool ? In addition to finding a system that allows you to reuse your work , keep in mind that there are still plenty of customers who have critical data on premises , and they require a solution that can tie all that data together . When you are looking at an iPaaS to standardize on , its well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it absolutely has to meet these additional criteria : <p> The platform needs to make it easy to keep on-premises apps connected and in the mix . An iPaaS should make it as easy to tie legacy systems together with cloud apps as it makes the cloud-to cloud scenario . <p> In the cloud and hybrid world , integration still needs to occur behind the firewall to make the IT conversation easier , while also allowing a cloud-controlled interface to make your consultants jobs easier by giving them the control they need while still adhering to IT security policies . <p> The more common integration connections you create on a standardized platform , the larger your library becomes , making each new customer onboarding process smoother and faster , so look for plenty of connection points . <p> By leveraging iPaaS , you can not only get that initial integration process completed quickly , but you now have a tool in place that makes the ongoing care and feeding of that integration simple and straightforward for your entire team .

Nothing will derail adoption like a breach that makes the headline news . <p> The IEEE framework definitely provides the construct to address high-risk areas , given that the intent is to deepen industry engagement through workshops , roundtables and other forums . While the IEEE framework can not address all risk , there are certain areas that require a deeper dialogue , including : <p> Monetization of IoT applications : This must be front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , using data harvested from IoT , that will be new and complementary to the strategies they currently have .

However , since there are now various standards , there is a real chance that devices will require different bridges , gateways and hubs . The hardware and the software that manage it all requires a high degree of skill to set up and maintain . All that costs money and time . <p> The digital experience : The customer experience will have to be center stage , regardless of whether it is consumer , business or industrial IoT . We have seen a number of products enter the market ; the ones that do well focus on a seamless consumer experience . The ones that have exited or will soon become irrelevant did not listen enough to their consumers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the customer adds in new devices and services . <p> Fear of the Thing : It has to diminish . In fact , this is similar to when cloud entered the market . Adding sensors , actuators and other useful " things " provides value but also adds security worries because these things need to be connected to a hub , gateway and/or router . Customers and end users need to feel confident that sensitive personal and business information is secured at all times . <p> A lack of security ground rules : We need a comprehensive security-assurance model that may be applied across verticals in a homogenous manner . As there are varying degrees of sensitivity around devices and the data they gather and protocols in use , naturally the security standards also vary . Still , a security-assurance model will help establish the ground rules among devices , users , service providers and integrators on how each party engages within the ecosystem . <p> Kuruvilla Mathew is chief innovation officer at Ness Digital Engineering .

After dedicating company time , resources and focus to the assessment for roughly two-and-a-half years , I can say in hindsight that the authorization is the single greatest achievement in our companys history , and the investment was well worth it . <p> Still , while the benefits of achieving FedRAMP are clear , I 'd be remiss not to mention the challenges . The 30-month evaluation process was an arduous one that required immense effort , focus and persistence from leadership and technical staff . However , we knew what we were signing up for . FedRAMPs reputation precedes it , and weve all heard the cautionary tales : <p> Its an expensive and time-consuming process . <p> The requirements are complex and a challenge to adhere to . <p> You could invest the time and money and come up short , no better off than when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those of you brave enough to persist , I 'd pose the question : When you consider the nature of the framework and the highly classified nature of some federal government data , would you expect anything different ? <p> Here are some lessons learned : <p> The folks at FedRAMP do strive to make things as easy as possible . Its smart to get guidance and input from FedRAMPs project management office , and it was key to closely align with the FedRAMP PMO from the start . <p> What about the cost ? While I cant share our companys investment , a blog published on the FedRAMP website estimates that the median cost for a mid-range cloud service provider to achieve a FedRAMP authorization is $2.25 million . Undeniably , FedRAMP is an expensive endeavor . If you have the opportunity to be among the first in your category to achieve authorization , that is of value . I know the return will significantly outweigh the cost for us , but that may not be true for everyone . <p> Outside of the hard expenses , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources , focused a team of employees on the project , and trusted that the time , budget and attention would prove more fruitful than if they were dedicated elsewhere . <p> In terms of time , FedRAMP estimates that authorization takes 11 to 18 months on average ; we invested to two and a half years in the project overall . <p> There are a couple different routes to FedRAMP Authorization . A few months before we received the authorization , we gained sponsorship from the Federal Communications Commission . For us , that greatly expedited the process . Once the FCC sponsored us , we accomplished authorization in six months the fastest on record . We also benefitted from the involvement of an independent third-party assessment organization , which helped us prepare for the audit performed by FedRAMPs 3PAO . FedRAMPs security requirements are incredibly complex , and can prove difficult to understand at times , so the outside expertise of the 3PAO was a great asset that helped us succeed in the audit . <p> Looking back at our experience , I have the utmost respect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FedRAMP offers a great service to federal agencies , which no longer have to spend time and money performing independent vendor evaluations . <p> I believe FedRAMP and its security-assessment framework is also of great value to vendors like collab9 and their channel partners . Its no secret that cloud-security concerns were pervasive in government and , as a result , cloud adoption among agencies has been delayed at best . FedRAMP helps remove some of that reticence , making it easier for government agencies to migrate to the cloud . <p> Kevin Schatzle has over 28 years experience in the IT industry and is currently CEO of collab9. 193521 @qwx393521

Industry predictions are often based on research , but also from watching the unfolding of day-to-day events . At the end of the year , we reflect on what happened over the past 12 months and how these events have or are likely to impact partner firms in the upcoming year . <p> So here we are . <p> Did industry participants expectations for 2016 come to fruition ? What shaped up to be the good , the bad , and the ugly as well as any surprises ? Here we take a look at 2016 in review and some of the most relevant channel partner news of the year . <h> 2016 Rewind : Partner Transformation Is in Motion <p> The channel is beyond the inflection point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of channel partners made consistent and sustainable cloud profits . Sixty three percent had average revenue growth rates of 20 percent and only 34 percent did not see any revenue growth . Essentially , the gap between " haves " and " have nots " increased , Anurag Agrawal , CEO and analyst at Techaisle told us . The " haves " were able to successfully distance themselves from the " have-nots . " Most are able to strike a balance between recurring and non-recurring revenues , product and services revenue . <p> PartnerPath CEO Diane Krakora is on the same page as Agrawal . She told us that in 2016 , the industry got serious about cloud after five years of talking about a transition to subscription or on-demand solutions . <p> " Cloud-based solutions still are n't  the lions share of most vendors or solution providers businesses ; however , everyone we talk to is serious about investing in these capabilities , " she said , adding that both vendors and solution providers realize on-demand or subscription-based models are impacting their businesses . <h> 2016 Rewind : MSP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MSP Platte River Networks hosted a private email server for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and had their day before a congressional panel about it . <p> Overlooking the politics of the situation and going to the heart of the story is a technical question as well as a professional question for the industry all to date unanswered . The question is n't the liability of the MSP but is related to data privacy , to change and event management , such as what should an MSP do when its been said was instructed to delete certain accounts . <p> " No matter where you end up on the political spectrum , there 's an undeniable question that the MSP was involved ; the MSP played a central role in the email scandal and whether they did the right thing or the wrong thing , there 's a huge lesson to be learned by other MSPs to say , you need to know who your clients are ; you need to know what their data privacy and data security needs are ; you need to protect yourself as an MSP , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared with us . <p> " The big takeaway was that this MSP failed to take protection of itself by doing things that could be remotely considered obstruction of justice . There should have been some policies in place within the MSPs organizational structure to say , " Wait a minute , should we really do this ? Should we wipe a server ? Should we be deleting files from a backup cloud provider ? All of these questions separate from politics demand an answer , " Weaver noted . <h> 2016 Rewind : Customers Lean On More Managed-Service Support <p> Business customers are increasingly likely to ask their service providers about monthly support services to mitigate any risk and accelerate the resolution of potential IT environment problems rather than work in a break/fix mode . <p> Its no surprise then that more solution providers with a traditional on-premises bent are now offering managed services , and that when it comes to managed services there continues to be upward growth , according to the MSPAlliance. <h> 2016 Rewind : Cybersecurity " No One Is Safe <p> We had another year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ransomware . To jog your memory , there were more than a dozen ransomware attacks on hospitals ; a data breach on the IRS ( initially uncovered in 2015 ) ended up with more than 700,000 taxpayers having their personal information compromised ; the U.S. Department of Justice database ; 10,000 Department of Homeland Security employees info was hacked and 20,000 FBI employees ; and , Verizon Enterprise Solutions was hit by hackers who stole info on 1.5 million customers . <p> But 2016 also shaped up to be the year where we saw the democratization of cyber crime . It used to be that you had to be a pretty big or visible target to warrant getting hacked . Not anymore . Today , all you need is a connection to the Internet to be someones target . <p> " Theyll take something from you or use your system to hijack its processing power to launch an attack on something else .

Bromiums new risk assessment rapidly determines how an organization will benefit from VBS , and identifies the top risks within existing security defenses . If the assessment does n't  identify any risks , Bromium refunds customers fees . <p> Targeting employees and endpoint devices remains a highly effective and efficient means of breaching a corporate network . Its effective because its easy to deliver malware via end users on computers due to overwhelming numbers of vulnerable machines to exploit and humans who compound the exposure . According to the current Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report , " Phishing , as a leading action , provides a number of advantages over many other exploit approaches " and " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the browser is . " <p> " Protecting end-users devices is a crucial step for breach prevention . Unfortunately , organizations often pursue piecemeal endpoint security strategies based on an incomplete picture of their devices and employees actual behavior and the associated security risks they generate , " said Gavin Hill , Bromiums Vice President of Product and Strategy . " Our assessment alleviates deployment and ROI concerns by showing customers their true security posture before and after the assessment . Whether malware avoids detection for hours or months , it presents severe dangers on the endpoint . With our security-conscious installed base of global customers , we find that next-generation anti-virus tools do n't  catch everything and it only takes one compromise for a company to get owned . " ad <p> The Bromium Risk Assessment helps organizations improve their endpoint security and breach prevention by finding previously unknown security risks , uncovering malware evading traditional defenses . Customers currently using Bromium are protected from zero-day threats ( see infographic ) and it works as a catch-all when next gen anti-virus fails . " I absolutely would recommend Bromium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market that you can rely on to be effective 100% of the time , " said Paul Hershberger , Director of Security Risk and Compliance at Mosaic , via a TechValidate study . <p> Conducted by Bromiums professional services team and channel partners , the assessment offers superior value compared to traditional consulting and implementation services , by placing a larger burden on organizations . This should be an easy decision for security leaders because Bromium refunds the cost of assessment services when no security threats are discovered and credits service fees toward customers purchase of enterprise deployments . <p> " Organizations often worry that deploying a more sophisticated endpoint defense requires trade-offs in management , performance and end-user productivity with uncertain security gains in return , " Hill added . " Our new Risk Assessment offering completely dispels these worries . We empower security leaders and executives for success by conclusively showing them how to regain proactive control of their endpoints , while also demonstrating how easy it is to deploy and how quickly theyll experience the value . " <p> The Risk Assessment comes at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end user in an enterprise security strategy . A recent study from the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) found that a majority of the typical end users they interviewed experienced security fatigue that often leads users to risky computing behavior at work and in their personal lives . By deploying Bromium , enterprise security teams can stop policing end users and stop worrying about endpoint breaches . At the same time , their entire enterprise security infrastructure is more effective and efficient by providing unmatched visibility into an attackers strategy , tactics and techniques . <p> Heading to San Francisco in February ?

The most effective security position a company can have is the result of a comprehensive risk assessment , which , if done correctly , will lead to the proper balance of the right people , the right processes and the right technology . In other words , technology is not the silver bullet ; it cant solve for a lack of employee training or proper governance . Without a thorough risk assessment , a security solution is just a Band-Aid . <p> CP : How do you go about developing a risk-assessment capability in-house ? <p> CR : It starts with a commitment from the top down to embrace and maintain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies and to conduct a review of the companys security stance . Its surprising how many organizations do n't  know the value of their data or even where it is stored , so we recommend customers conduct an asset inventory . These are just a few of the steps companies should take . <p> CP : What are some of the pitfalls that can occur when developing a risk-analysis capability , and how can you avoid them ? <p> CR : The weakest link in any security stance is a human . Lack of buy-in from all layers of the organization , lack of proper training these are the biggest pitfalls to a successful governance program . Complexity is another pitfall ; the more a company invests in security , the more people they need . It can get very complicated . Establishing a governance framework ( which incorporates a risk management program ) is key to avoiding these issues . <p> CP : Are there challenges to selling security to the C-suite ? What skills are needed to successfully sell to them ? <p> CR : Most business leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security are simply not sustainable . The equipment , maintenance and staffing needed to defend against escalating and increasingly sophisticated threats can quickly account for 20-50 percent of an IT budget . Striving for simplicity , for a comprehensive governance framework with the right technology to support it , is the most effective way to get senior leaders on board . 193521 @qwx393521

" <p> Many companies in the channel are in the midst of transforming from legacy hardware to services and a recurring-revenue model . <p> " While we all talk a big game about transforming business , its not easy to do , " Ostrowski said . " In fact , it can be very difficult , especially for a small business .

" <p> The UCaaS and CCaaS markets now are seeing broader adoption , from being primarily SMB-focused to midmarket and enterprise businesses now adopting , faster than anyone predicted , Roman said . <p> " With the shift up-market , large enterprises are turning to their trusted advisers whom they have been working with for many years their channel partners to help them make this transition to the cloud , " he said . " This creates new opportunities for traditionally on-premises-focused partners to build a new recurring revenue-based business model .

" <p> " Companies that have the ability to meet a customers needs on several fronts those are the types of companies that I think are really going to make a lot of headway and being able to be that turnkey solution provider , " Newton said " So companies that can be more sophisticated and not have to pawn off a certain element of a customers needs to another company , that 's where the push is .

" So its no longer just a traditional network or traditional backup services , or disaster recovery as a service ( DRaaS ) .
