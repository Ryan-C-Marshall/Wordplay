Their name in Nahuatl ( language of region ) , was chilli and this term was applied to all members of the group which belong to the capsicum family . <p> Despite their antiquity , the capsicum remained a well kept secret of the " New World " until Christopher Columbus introduced it to Europe during the 15th century . <p> There are hundreds of chilli varieties 150 alone in Mexico ranging in pungency from sweet to fiery hot . Rich in Vitamin C , chillies contain a volatile oil , capsaicin , which is the source of their piquancy and found in the seeds and ribs of the pepper . <p> Green chillies are no less hot than red , in fact their pungency is about the same .

 gold rush town to crack dark matter mystery <p> Scientists could be on the verge of a major breakthrough in Western Victoria . <p> Dark matter is believed to make up a sizable percentage of all matter in the universe . <p> Scientists could be on the verge of a major breakthrough in Western Victoria , and the site of the Stawell Gold Mine could hold the key to the world-first discovery . <p> The Centre of Excellence for Particle Physics ( CoEPP ) is leading an international search to determine whether the site is suitable to support the detection of dark matter . <p> Preliminary testing has proven positive with the next one to two months critical in the organisation 's efforts to conclude if construction of an underground laboratory - the first of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere , is feasible . <p> Visiting Stawell last week , alongside Professor Elisabetta Barberio and Doctor Matteo Volpi for a presentation on dark matter , Director , Professor Geoffrey Taylor said the University of Melbourne scientists involved in the study were also part of the discovery of the Higgs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to confirm the existence of the Higgs field , which is pivotal to the Standard Model and other theories within particle physics . <p> " The next big question for us is what dark matter is made of ?

" <p> Prof Taylor said experiments to look for dark matter need to be in controlled areas which filter out natural backgrounds , cosmic rays and particles . <p> He said they are best carried out in the bottom of a mine and the Stawell site provides them with a lot of advantages . <p> " Its access , it is deep enough , has massive cavities which can be used for putting in equipment and conducting experiments , " he said . <p> " It has a lot of interesting characteristics as well .

 of alleged abuse of Oberon three-year-old <p> INVESTIGATION : Police were called to a home in Oberon last month after reports a three-year-old boy had been badly hurt . A man accused of the manslaughter of the child faced a bail hearing yesterday . <p> A BAIL hearing yesterday for a man accused of the manslaughter of his stepson heard horrifying allegations of ongoing abuse against the victim , who was just three years old when he died . <p> The 45-year-old man , who was last week charged by police with man-slaughter and reckless wounding causing grievous bodily harm , sat with his head hung , wearing prison greens and handcuffs , during the proceedings before magistrate Michael Allen , who refused the bail application . <p> In his 30-year involvement with the judicial system , Mr Allen told the court he had never seen allegations so abhorrent in their nature . <p> During the bail application , the court heard disturbing allegations contained in the police facts , which outlined the alleged abuse inflicted on the toddler as well as the injuries he suffered . <p> The injuries included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his brain , which possibly caused his cardiac arrest ; a distended abdomen ; compressions in the eighth , ninth , 10th and 11th vertebrae and possibly a severed vertebrae , none of which were consistent with the explanation offered to police by the accused and co-accused following the three-year-old 's death in August . <p> Both the accused , and the co-accused , a 40-year-old woman who was subsequently charged with the child 's murder , told police the child fell and hit his head after becoming entangled in the leads of two pet dogs . <p> Facts disclosed to the court told how the deceased child had lived with his grandmother , only returning to the custody of his mother and stepfather on June 13 , 2014 . <p> On August 3 , 2014 , emergency services were called to their residence in Cunynghame Street , Oberon . Emergency services were told the three-year-old went into cardiac arrest after colliding with two dogs , falling back and hitting his head . <p> The mother told police after the incident the child got to his feet , looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where emergency services were contacted . <p> He was flown to Westmead Hospital , where he later died , and where other injuries were noted . <p> The court heard among the allegations of abuse inflicted on the child were that he was hit and kicked to the ground ; kicked in the groin and feet ; hit on the head and the hands with a wooden spoon ; and had his head slammed into a sliding door . <p> It was also alleged the toddler was punched and placed in an esky full of ice and water and had the lid forcibly closed on him while inside . <p> It was also alleged the accused hit the child 's bare bottom and penis with a wooden spoon , and used duct tape to stick a plastic ball in his mouth and to secure his hands behind his body . <p> The court was also told that , in a later interview with police , the accused made admissions to some of the alleged assaults , including physically restraining the child in the esky , telling police he used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> DPP solicitor Ashlee Weir said the crown opposed the bail , submitting the alleged violence was of a constant and ongoing nature . She also noted the victim , while alive , did not receive medical treatment for his injuries , instead being treated at home in an attempt to hide the assaults . <p> She said the crown 's case was strong and there was a real risk the accused would not appear on future occasions . <p> In handing down his decision , Mr Allen said there was an unacceptable risk the accused would fail to appear in the future as well as an unacceptable risk he would interfere with witnesses . <p> He also noted the abhorrent nature of alleged violence against a three-year-old child , and refused bail . <p> He ordered the brief to be served by November 3 , 2014 , with replies on November 10 . <p> The accused , who is in protective custody , will appear on November 10 via AVL. <h> Related Items <h> 
 Lately , I 've been guilty of groaning about the number of feminist-type articles around . <p> It felt like they were saturating my internet feeds and the front pages of a number of news websites I like to flick through . A chorus of voices singing the same rhetoric , that to me seems like common sense , over and over again . <p> I was so sick of them though I ca n't actually tell if they really were everywhere I looked , or if , in reality , it was actually probably my brain somehow automatically seeking out the bylines of female writers or eye-catching words like rape and domestic violence because stories covering those issues have been so dominant recently . <p> Do you see what I did there ? ( And for the record , I did actually think like that at the time . ) <p> I turned the blame back on myself . It 's my fault for being sick of seeing and reading feminist articles because I am unconsciously automatically seeking them out . <p> It feels like that attitude pervades every aspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pretty harmless because everyone has a right to free speech and I have the right not to read it . It 's when it affects others that it becomes the real issue . <p> My irritation with the amount of feminist articles I was seeing and reading ( it 's your own fault Emma , pick something else ! ) stemmed from exhaustion . <p> Exhaustion of reading AGAIN that another woman died after being beaten by her partner for no reason , another woman in the world was sexually assaulted and died as a result of her injuries and yet again someone in a position of power saying , after a girl who reported being sexually assaulted by a group of men while innocently walking home , that women should n't walk alone at night . Or at all ever , really . <p> I 'm beyond exhausted now . Now , I 'm joining that chorus . <p> My outrage is real . I am offended and I feel defiant . I 'm not sure why I 've taken Albury mayor Kevin Mack 's comments in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other reports of the same type of comments , perhaps it 's because I have family in Albury , but whatever the reason , for a man in a position of power like Cr Mack to say what he said is just plain wrong . <p> For the record he said : " I always have encouraged women not to walk alone , to have someone with them at all times , because that in itself is an invitation for someone to take advantage of you . " In every instance a sentence like this is uttered from anyone it reeks of that person trying to cover their own ass so in the future , if need be , they can say , ' Well , I warned you to be careful . ' <p> Cr Mack has since apologised and that is all well and good but yet again the real problem is highlighted the default attitude that the victim , that women , should take more precaution to keep themselves safe . Victim blaming . <p> Here 's just one thing that has struck me about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl was walking home from work and the footbridge she was going to take is right near the CBD , a part of town that is usually busy , the mayor said . <p> I should n't have to live my life , or choose my job , based on whether I can walk home in daylight with a bodyguard . <p> My work means that I finish work anywhere from 5.30pm to midnight , and I ca n't always park my car close to work . If I finish work at night and ca n't walk to my car or home at a time when the majority of others would be out walking , whether it also be home from work or for exercise , then when can I walk alone ? I should n't have to live my life , or choose my job , based on whether I can walk home in daylight with a bodyguard . <p> Here 's something else that struck me as strange while mulling over the mayor 's comments and this situation ; as a child most of us become naturally afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was afraid of the dark , it was probably just a natural progression of becoming more aware and curious of my surroundings . Whatever the reason , I went through a period of being afraid of the dark and slept with the bedroom door slightly ajar and a crack of light peeking through . It always comforted me . It brightened the shadows where my mind would create hidden monsters . Eventually I grew out of it . <p> Now , in a way , it feels like women are constantly being told to be afraid of the dark again . It 's not safe to be in the dark because there is a different , more real type of monster out there waiting to maybe attack us if they so feel like it - man . Now is most definitely the time for me to say that I do n't mean all men in general will attack a woman . Indeed , I have some incredibly fun , kind and loving men in my life who would never attack anyone and also believe it is utter crap women are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street . <p> Except , it 's not just the dark that we need to be worried about now , it 's daylight too . An attack could happen anywhere , anytime and to anyone ( names like Jill Meagher , Masa Vukotic instantly spring to mind ) , and that outrages me . <p> Whenever things like this happen and the seemingly inevitable comments like Cr Mack 's are made , I feel like a child again . And that offends me . I do n't want to be afraid of the things I was afraid of as a child . I am an adult woman living in the year 2015 and I want to live my life without the shackles of someone else 's dysfunction possibly mentally and physically hurting me . I want to live my life without fears I know can be prevented . <p> I have no hard and fast solutions for what is happening . And I 'm not sure there is one hard and fast solution . That 's not what this article is about . When it comes to our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept that , and to a certain degree that is fair , but as with anything there is a line . There comes a point where others have to take responsibility for their own actions . They have to be aware of the attitude they have and put out into the world . They need to know the difference between right and wrong and care about doing the right thing . They need to respect other living human beings . They need to think before they speak . Writing these things is repetitive . They 've been said before and they 'll no doubt be said again . For the record , here are the things that have previously exhausted my eyes and ears but that clearly need to be repeated because maybe , just maybe , if they are repeated enough the message will at least start to filter through to the sections of society that need to heed it the most : <p> As a woman , these streets are my streets too ; <p> As a woman , I have every right to walk down the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit in my own home etc and not be attacked ; <p> As a woman , my body is my own and no means no ; <p> As a woman , if , god forbid , I do ever happen to get assaulted I do n't deserve to cop some of the blame because I was simply going about my business and someone else could n't control themselves . <p> I 'm tired of hearing of another rape , another murder , another thoughtless caution for women not to do something we are well within our rights to do . We should do things . We should speak out . We should repeat our opinions until they are heard and listened to . We should be defiant towards the default attitude . <p> I have a voice , this is my defiance , this is my addition to the chorus in the hope for change .@@3236666 <h> Opinion Features <p>

" <p> Mr Condliffe said high overheads and a reliance on the export market were both factors that made keeping farmers ' heads above water a challenge . <p> " Also I think the supermarkets apply downward pressure to our domestic prices and I do n't think that 's helpful , they 've got to realise that the rural industry needs to be able to survive and be profitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of product but we still need our domestic to be profitable for the farmer to actually turn a profit at the farm gate and that seems to be a bit of a struggle , particularly for young families .

 history of slavery in presidential plantations <p> Slavery was abolished in the United States 150 years ago , but its former stamping grounds can still be visited . <p> On the approach to the house is a pet graveyard . Animal-shaped headstones commemorate beloved companions loved by generations of the Tyler family , which has lived at the Sherwood Forest Plantation since 1616 . <p> One has an epitaph engraved on it . " Here lie the bones of my old horse General . Who served his master faithfully for 21 years . And never made a blunder . Would that his master could say the same . " <p> The words belong to John Tyler , the most famous former occupant of the plantation and 10th president of the United States . And they act as a prelude to a scene of sumptuous , historic , quintessentially Virginian prettiness . <p> Centuries-old woodland flanks the carefully mown lawns around the gigantic house . It 's more than 90 metres long , with the white wood-framed exterior carefully maintained . Around it are the " dependencies " , a collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation of an almost self-supporting community of approximately 110 people for four centuries " . <p> There 's a smokehouse , a wine house , an overseers ' house and a servants ' house where between 60 and 90 field hands would have lived . <p> It 's those euphemisms that stick uncomfortably in the throat . " Community " . " Servants ' house " . " Field hands " . The linguistic leaps exercised in order to avoid any mention of slavery are astonishing . Last month it was 150 years since the 13th Amendment abolished slavery in the United States , but many in the south would still prefer to apply the airbrush instead of the magnifying glass . <p> It 's an attitude that leads to Confederate flags being proudly flown , seen as a symbol of southern traditions and states ' rights . Acknowledging that the tradition and right in question was keeping human beings as slaves ? Well , that 's just impolite to bring up , sir . <p> Virginia has a stronger connection to slavery than most states . In 1607 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonists , and tobacco quickly became the passport to riches . Plantations spread out across the colony , first along the James River then further afield . And cheap labour was needed to cultivate a crop that required intensive work . Enslaved Africans , already being shipped to the Caribbean to work on sugar plantations , became the obvious answer . <p> By the time tobacco was replaced by wheat prices had plummeted and tobacco ravages soil in the late 18th century , the slavery system was firmly established . <p> The Berkeley Plantation , a few kilometres up the James River from Sherwood Forest , also has a presidential pedigree . The stout , Georgian red brick house was the birthplace of Tyler 's predecessor , William Henry Harrison . <p> The grounds are similarly dreamy , with boxy formal gardens , crops still growing to the sides and lashings of blooming magnolia . The tours of the house and the little museum in the basement delve into what is in many respects an illustrious history . The first Thanksgiving service in America was held by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidents ; the American bugle call equivalent of the Last Post Taps was composed on site while Union troops used the plantation as a base in the Civil War . <p> Slavery , however , is not high on the agenda . But at least it is n't ducked altogether . The tour guide admits he ca n't offer too much insight into the topic , as there is n't all that much documentation to show how many slaves were there and how the Harrison family treated them . <p> What little there is can be found inside the old coach house . Inside , there 's a model of a typical early 1800s slave cabin . Very few originals are still in existence , largely because they were made out of wood and never built to last . There 's also a small painting of the slave quarters at Berkeley from the 1700s . <p> But it 's the 1791 slave inventory that offers the most chilling insight . No tales of brutality or cruelty can match up the casual administrative efficiency of listing 110 slaves by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side , either indicating a skilled job such as " blacksmith " , " doctor " or " cook " , or limitation . Some are described as " superannuated " , others " fat " or " infant " . <p> York , the 27-year-old blacksmith , is valued at ? 100 . Old Isiah , an 80-year-old , has a zero next to his name . That cold , indifferent piece of accountant 's housekeeping manages to tell quite an story . <p> Harrison and Tyler , of course , are relatively obscure commanders in chief who usually come way down any list of greatest presidents . But George Washington is always top or pretty near it and his Mount Vernon home near Alexandria gives an admirably balanced view of a man who is often lionised in the country he led to independence . <p> Situated on a majestic spot overlooking the wilder stretches of the Potomac River , Mount Vernon is a well-oiled tourist magnet , and the tours of the house itself are the least interesting part . The museum section at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the woodland leads to Washington 's tomb and a slave graveyard . <p> The latter is currently being excavated in an attempt to get more information on those buried in it , a sign that Washington 's complex relationship with slavery is being taken seriously . The slave quarters have also been reconstructed to give an idea of what they would have been like imagine a sturdily constructed countryside hostel dorm where cooking has to be done in the corner rather than in a separate kitchen . <p> Mount Vernon also runs specific tours on the subject of slavery , and a picture emerges of a man reluctant to take a lead . Washington owned 318 slaves when he died , and his will stated that they would be freed upon his wife 's death . He also stated that the children and the old and infirm slaves must be taken care of . <p> His treatment of the slaves seems somewhat patrician . He was interested enough in their welfare and sense of community to encourage them to marry and have families although this handily gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also expected them to work as hard as he did and that meant at least dawn until dusk . <p> Of the nine presidents to own slaves , Washington was the only one to free them . Had he done so during his lifetime , it may have set a precedent along the lines of the one he set by refusing to serve more than two terms . It 's hard not to leave Mount Vernon without a vision of a normally strong leader making one historically devastating timid fudge . <p> Just outside Charlottesville , Jefferson 's hilltop home gives a strong sense of his personality , with scores of curiosities he collected from around the world on display . But the tours bring forth the stories . <p> Jefferson wrote the line in the Declaration of Independence that stated all men are created equal with an unalienable right to liberty . He also banned the importation of slaves during his presidency . But he kept around 200 human beings in bondage at any one time , as testified to by his own fastidious documentation . He sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families , and freed five slaves in his will . These were all males from the Hemings family . <p> And it 's while walking Mulberry Row , where the slaves would have lived , that the Hemings family story truly hits home . Elizabeth Hemings had several children by Jefferson 's father-in-law . Of these children , Sally Hemings was widely believed to have had a relationship with Jefferson himself , spanning over 30 years . Six of Sally 's children were believed to have been fathered by Jefferson . <p> Few things make the notion that this was a different world strike home like knowing that the president most obsessed with liberty kept his own children enslaved . And Virginia 's presidential plantations are a disturbing , thought-provoking window on that different world . <h> TRIP NOTES <h> MORE INFORMATION <p> virginia.org . <h> GETTING THERE <h> STAYING THERE <p> The Historic Powhatan Resort in Williamsburg near the James River plantations is a former plantation itself .

Nothing posh , mind you , but those fabulous old motels of the 1950s and ' 60s that dotted the Australian landscape on my childhood road trips . <p> There are still some left , although many were rebranded " motor lodges " in the 1970s and others fell victim to re-routed highways and the modern desire for something fancier , which are now called " resorts " . <p> The old motels were not destinations in themselves but offered convenience as pit stops on those achingly long drives we Australians have to endure to get anywhere . They were a good alternative to rooms above the pub , which for many decades were the only source of respite in remote towns . <p> If you had a family , pubs were n't always so savoury , but motels held the guarantee of airconditioning , tea-making facilities , a fridge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motels were rarely booked out so you could pull up quite late at night and find a room . The front office was sometimes manned by a person who was a bit oddball , but I 've never heard of a real-life Norman Bates . Still , motels are popular locations for film noir and hard-boiled murder mysteries for a reason the anonymity of them is conducive to sleazy activity once the polyester curtains are drawn . <p> Motels were a luxury for my family . We travelled north from Melbourne each Christmas on a very limited budget , which meant dad would pitch a tent for us in a variety of camping grounds , mostly in inland towns , as we avoided the coast road . <p> One year , the temperature soared to near 40 degrees , so my parents splurged on stopping at a couple of motels during the trip . We 'd hire a room for the day , mum and dad would rest in the airconditioning , and we girls would romp in the pool ( in T-shirts , hats and noses covered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'd set off again and drive in the cool . <p> The simple motel was such a treat in those circumstances . Even a synthetic mustard-coloured bedspread or a Butternut Snap sealed in plastic seemed exotic to me at the time . I remember one that was glamorously called the Zebra Motel and I think it was perhaps in Dubbo . <p> I often fantasise about buying a motel that is a bit down at heel and turning it into a retirement village of sorts , with friends installed in every room and a concierge in the office to manage our activities . It 's a bit of a pipe dream , as the motels in desirable coastal locations are pretty pricey , if you can find one . But , what fun it would be ! <p> Brisbane sisters Elisha and Siobhan Bickle love motels too , and rescued an old 1960s motel , the Hideaway , on Cabarita Beach in northern NSW , thinking they could renovate it into a holiday home for their numerous children . Cabarita ( " " to the locals ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its charm despite the coastal development that has rampaged down the coast below Coolangatta . <p> Instead , Elisha and Siobhan turned the neglected building into Australia 's hottest new hotel . They named it Halcyon House for the " halcyon days " of classic Australian beach holidays they remembered from childhood . <p> They added another storey , whitewashed the walls and furnished the motel in summery blue and white fabrics , adding collections of objects such as sea shells and framed seascapes bought at op shops to give it all a homey feel . <p> They also created an acclaimed restaurant , Paper Daisy , with food by chef Ben Devlin , " Queensland 's best young chef " , and which has on its menu a classic prawn and avocado sandwich . Guests are greeted with ice-cream and Eskies and umbrellas are handed out for the beach . Bicycles with baskets are freely available for a cruise along the boardwalk . <p> Playing the nostalgia card was a smart move by Elisha and Siobhan . Shortly after opening , Halcyon House was named runner-up best hotel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr &amp; Mrs Smith . While the prices reflect a five-star resort , it 's the authenticity that 's captivating everyone who stays there . It 's such a far cry stylistically from the high-rise hotels of the Gold Coast , it is hard to believe the motel is only a 15-minute drive from that airport . <p> Hopefully the success of Halcyon House will inspire others to conserve and love our wonderful old motels. <h> Look after your 
 stripped from Castlemaine church <p> A Castlemaine woman tied ribbons at the church to remember victims . Two hours later , they were gone . <p> A Castlemaine woman was left deflated after a local Catholic church removed ribbons she had strung to symbolise support for victims of child sexual abuse . <p> Melinda Webster said she tied ribbons in pink , green , red and purple , with tags explaining their meaning , to the front entrance at St Mary 's Catholic Parish in Castlemaine last week , only to return two hours later and find them gone . <p> Ms Webster said she was " not surprised , but disappointed " by the ribbons being removed from the church so swiftly . <p> Two years ago , at the age of 50 , her own husband disclosed his own history of abuse in an interstate boarding school . <p> Father Wahid Riad of St Mary 's in Castlemaine said he had not removed the ribbons , although some of his parishioners had mentioned them to him and they may have taken them down . <p> Ms Webster said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but emerged from a feeling of frustration and hopelessness after revelations during the Royal Commission . <p> " We need to stop and think about families and victims , the people that have taken their own lives , " Ms Webster said . <p> " We realise now it is rampant ... it 's a horrible , ugly , terrible thing to talk about . <p> " But too many children have suffered in silence for too long . " <p> She said she had been thanked via social media for her move , and she said if even one person felt they were listened to and believed , it was worthwhile . <p> Father Riad the ribbons had been strung up without his knowledge and although he was unaware of their meaning , he wanted to support victims . <p> " I was n't sure what it was about ... no one asked permission or approached me , " he said . <p> " But we 're happy to be in solidarity with the victims and do anything that would be helpful to them . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still hurting . " <p> He urged concerned community members to approach him and hoped he could work with them to honour victims of abuse at the hands of the clergy . <p> " We need to work together for healing and compassion , " he said . <p> The ribbons were an idea replicated from the original " Loud Fence " in Ballarat , which saw the front fence of the former St Alipius Boys ' School site covered in bright ribbons to remember victims of institutional abuse . <h> UK minister defends 
 to fix all black spots <p> WITHIN minutes of a story about the federal government calling for community input into mobile black spots appearing on **28;806;TOOLONG yesterday , it became clear there is much work to do . <p> In central Victoria alone , there are many locations where mobile phone coverage is inadequate and at times , dangerous . <p> You do n't have to travel far out of Bendigo to know your mobile phone is unreliable indeed , even within Bendigo and surrounding suburbs , phone coverage is patchy and unpredictable depending on your carrier . <p> It would come as no surprise to many central Victorians or those working in emergency services that the City of Greater Bendigo says poor mobile coverage has impacted responses in emergency situations and is holding some areas back . <p> The government is now calling for submissions as it aims to prioritise areas for improved phone coverage , in round two of the Mobile Black Spot Program . <p> The region from Elmore to Macedon received funding for just two of 499 upgrades announced in the first round of the program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas and where there is zero reception . Many could argue that in central Victoria , where we are experiencing extremely dry conditions and have little coverage outside major regional towns , we would qualify . <p> We have far too many people living in areas where they can not rely on mobile phone coverage to make contact with emergency services should the need arise . <p> The first round of funding saw million allocated to 499 upgrades , only eight per cent of those identified as needing improvement . <p> Funding for round one was supplemented by Telstra , Vodafone , five state governments : New South Wales , Victoria , Queensland , Western Australia and Tasmania , local governments , businesses and community organisations . <p> This round , million will be allocated . It will not go far . If central Victorians want their black spots on the radar , they need to register them on the national database . <p> We can only then hope we will see more than two of the many , many black spots in our region upgraded and further financial commitment

 workers are taking their toll in the Bendigo region , with a number of employees being forced to take time off after violent incidents . <p> At the same time , hospitals are introducing new response measures to assist staff deal with violence and aggression , while the state government is pledging money for security upgrades to some regional hospitals . <p> Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation industrial relations organiser for Bendigo Loretta Marchesi said incidents of patient violence towards healthcare workers was occurring across a range of sectors including aged-care , emergency and psychiatric services . <p> " There 's physical as well as psychological injuries from occupational violence and aggression , " she said . <p> In 2015 , Bendigo Health introduced a " code grey " response for its employees to use when confronted with violence , trained some staff members in self-defence and dealt with a high number of patients under the influence of alcohol and drugs . <p> Ambulance drivers , too , found things tough . About 100 incidents in which a paramedic was physically assaulted were recorded across Victoria . <h> Many subjected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in physical injuries , psychological scarring and time off work for employees . <p> In the past year , reports and some hospitals have highlighted the levels of occupational violence those in the health sector face . <p> Many incidents involve patients under the influence of drugs and alcohol , while others are going unreported . <p> As far as the ANMF was concerned , Mr Marchesi said , violence was unacceptable and tighter security was needed to protect nurses . <p> " There needs to be a lot more security . A lot of outlying facilities do n't have 24-hour on-call security services to respond ... so the only thing open to them is calling the police , " she said . <p> " Any worker should be able to have some kind of security response team . " <p> Preventing incidents from occurring in the first place was also essential , Ms Marchesi said . <p> " You have to have the preventative measures in place you need to be doing something active , " she said . <p> Good policies to prevent and respond to situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear understanding of the behaviour of their patients and clients . <p> " It 's making sure the nurses are not left in vulnerable areas on their own . " <p> A number of incidents had occurred in Bendigo where staff had been injured , sometimes as a result of a patient being drug affected . <p> The impact a violent incident had on a worker was often influenced by how adequately their employer dealt with their situation , she said . <p> ? " Each nurse has a passion for their area , many will still follow their area of interest ( but ) it may be more difficult at times to get casuals to certain areas where there are higher incidence of violence , " Ms Marchesi said . <p> A number of health services across the region had already implemented better polices and procedures to prevent violence , she added . <p> " We want to work with each of the health services to have the best safety possible for our nurses . " <h> Steps to improve hospital security <p> Violence against healthcare workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public throughout 2015 . <p> In May , a Victorian Auditor-General 's report shed light on the high levels of occupational violence and the " unnecessary and preventable risks " many healthcare workers face simply going about their job . <p> The extent of the problem is " unknown " because of significant under-reporting and insufficient data keeping that fails to provide a state-wide picture , the report added . <p> At the same time as the report was being compiled and released , the issue reared its head in local media . <p> In March , the Advertiser reported on a rising incidence of violent and aggressive behaviour towards health workers and security staff at psychiatric treatment facility the Alexander Bayne Centre . <p> Many patients were affected by alcohol and drugs such as ice , while physical injuries had resulted in nurses and security staff taking time off . <p> In May , it was reported that Bendigo Health had introduced a " code grey " response mechanism aimed at helping staff deal with aggressive behaviour .

To help counter that risk , some Bendigo Health staff were being given self-defence training . <p> In response to the problem , the state government this week announced the first round of a million health service violence prevention fund . <p> Rochester and Elmore District Health Service will receive funds for CCTV cameras , safety glass and an access control system for a nurses ' station . Castlemaine Health will be given funding for lockable doors between an urgent care area and an acute ward 's nurses ' station , additional CCTV cameras and more . <p> Twenty-six hospitals across the state , 18 in rural areas , will share the funding , allocated on a needs basis after submissions from hospitals and health centres . <p> Minister for Health Jill Hennessy said violence was unacceptable . <p> " Our highly skilled frontline health care workers deserve to feel safe at work so they can do their job treating patients and saving lives , " she said . <h> On the road , paramedics in firing line <p> Violence against healthcare workers also occurs on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walsh said 328 reports of assault and aggression towards paramedics had been recorded in 2014/15 . <p> About 100 involved paramedics being physically assaulted , 120 related to verbal abuse and threats and the rest related to " near misses " or instances where a weapon was produced . About 100 of all cases involved drugs or alcohol . <p> " Sadly , we believe these reports are just the tip of the iceberg , " Mr Walsh said . " No paramedic in the Bendigo area , or , in fact , anywhere in Victoria , comes to work expecting to be harmed . " <p> Ambulance Victoria has established an occupational violence working group that reviews the training paramedics receive . <p> " Paramedics use a range of methods to manage violent patients or deescalate confrontation , ranging from verbal skills to sedating patients to ensure the most appropriate treatment for these patients , " Mr Walsh said . <h> Hollywood today :

 Five places that made me <p> Sydney was magical , Paris enchanting , but nowhere beats New York for this singer and actor . <h> SYDNEY <p> My first trip away from my family aged 12 took me to Sydney with my very good school friend . We stayed with her grandparents in their most glamorous apartment in Kirribilli , with magnificent views overlooking the harbour . Luna Park was close by and would light up at night while the Opera House sparkled across the water . And sometimes , on warm still nights we could hear the faint strains of music floating across . For a little girl from suburban Melbourne , it was like escaping to fairyland . <h> NEW YORK <p> Landing in New York for the first time was the most exciting experience of travel I have ever had .

It was and will always be my favourite city . <h> PARIS <p> My first experience flying first class was on the way to Paris , where I was to perform in French and English on behalf of Qantas at the Australian Embassy when it was launching direct flights from Sydney to Paris . I do n't think I slept at all on the flight ; I was too excited and kept busy sampling everything on offer . It was n't my first time in Paris but it was still just as beautiful as I remembered . We stayed on the Boulevard Houseman in a grand hotel reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn 's apartment in Charade . <h> BERLIN <p> I was given the opportunity to perform in Berlin and spent the entire week walking all over that amazing city . It had such a buzz to it the richness of the overlapping cultures , the streets brimming with creativity , amazing shops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We visited the remnants of the Berlin Wall and Checkpoint Charlie among other memorable sites and saw the bronze memorial plaques to the many murdered Jewish families laid in the pavements out the front of their homes . The history is there in every building and every street . <h> BALI <p> The most relaxing holiday I 've ever been on was in Bali with my two daughters . Having visited in the past without the girls , I thought a more secluded place would be loveliest for our little family holiday . A friend had recommended a low-key resort called Alila Manggis , right on the ocean in Candidasa . It was a truly magical experience , one the girls and I have repeated since and will no doubt revisit in the future . <p> Bernadette Robinson 's one-woman show Songs for Nobodies , written by Joanna Murray Smith and directed by Simon Phillips , was a sellout .

 items left behind at Travelodge <p> A diamond tiara , a collection of lightsabers and a miniature Shetland pony called Pudding are among the items left behind by Travelodge guests last year . <p> To accompany the usual phone chargers , wallets and keys , the hotel chain has released its list of the most bizarre belongings to end up in the lost and found department , broken down by location . <p> For example , at its Aberdeen Airport branch , an oil big wig was probably left a little sweaty after staff found a stray business contract between two petroleum companies . <p> Meanwhile , in Ayr , on the west coast of Scotland , someone forgot their Shetland pony . <p> Staff at Oldham Chatterton were left to find the owner of " a mother-in-law called June " , while the lost and found department at one of the Sunderland branches was graced with " a collection of prosthetic legs with different shoes " . <p> London Travelodge 's have taken into their custody an array of unusual items , including a family 's secret pasta recipe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitcase of Disney princess outfits at King 's Cross . <p> At the Bank branch in the city , somebody misplaced a business contract written in Mandarin . <p> In a similar vein , someone left a " set of company accounts " at the Travelodge in Inverness , while a prenuptial agreement was clearly not given the attention it deserves in Cardiff . Rather more concerning was the " set of manuals on how to fly a plane " found at Crawley , a town about 15 minutes from Gatwick Airport . <p> And finally , a very distraught Star Wars fan must be out there somewhere , after staff at Birmingham Newhall Street Travelodge found a collection of lightsabers in different colours . <p> The most regularly left behind items makes for a less exciting read , with chargers , tablets , mobile phones , kindles , ties , teddy bears and sat navs all in the top 10 . <p> Shakila Ahmed , Travelodge spokesperson , said : " Our 2015 left behind register has revealed that we have become a nation obsessed with smart technology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tablets and smartphones left behind in our hotels during the last 12 months . <p> " What is becoming evident after speaking to our customers is that the pace of modern life is fast and furious .

Testing standards for these batteries need to be stringent to ensure their safety , but there are concerns that cheaper hoverboards , which start from just under , might be fitted with batteries that are not manufactured to a sufficiently high standard . In Melbourne in January a fire that destroyed a house was caused by a hoverboard in charge mode , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices . <p> Most of these conflagrations seem to occur while the hoverboard is charging , which raises suspicions that the charger itself might be part of the problem . <p> The issue shot to prominence just after Christmas when actor Russell Crowe was denied boarding on a Virgin Australia flight because his sons were travelling with their hoverboards .

 some <p> Tomorrow 's Australia Day celebrations will be somewhat bittersweet for some members of Bendigo 's indigenous community , conscious of the fact the occasion also marks the anniversary of the raising of the British flag on Aboriginal land in 1788 . <p> Bendigo and District Aboriginal Co-Operative chief executive officer Raylene Harradine said there were mixed views on the topic in the region , but some community members viewed January 26 as " Invasion Day " . <p> " However on the other hand , Australia Day is a day of everyone coming together to celebrate what it means for Australia as a whole community , " she said . <p> " Australia Day is a time to celebrate the diversity we have within our community as well .

 increased attention toward the occurrence of one punch attacks in Australia , followed by death or serious brain injuries . Australia is not alone in showing concern towards such trends , as similar attacks where people are seriously injured or die are reported in the UK , Canada and elsewhere . <p> Nevertheless the Australian figures are striking : 91 people have been assaulted and killed between 2000 and 2013 . King 's Cross and NSW in general has seen the greatest number of these incidents , followed by Queensland and Victoria . <p> ' Coward punches ' or ' one punch attacks ' have occurred more frequently in precincts like Kings Cross and Fortitude Valley , late at night and almost always as a result of alcohol fueled violence . The particularly violent and deadly assaults to Thomas Kelly , Daniel Christie and others have led most state governments to introduce harsher legislation towards perpetrators , lock-out laws restricting access to pubs and reducing the time a last drink can be purchased . <p> Brisbane has not been spared by these events ; the recent death of 18-year-old Cole Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor Government has announced anti-violence legislation in line and even stricter than those implemented in Sydney CBD and King 's Cross . The question is : do these measures work ? They do to a certain degree . Various reports suggest a 40 per cent decrease in violence in the Sydney areas where they are implemented . However other reports also suggest that suburbs where the new laws do n't apply have seen an increase in alcohol fueled assaults and violence . So do the new measures shift the problem from one area to the other ? It is too early to make an objective assessment , but many are calling for such measures to be implemented state-wide . <p> Another legal approach pursued by most jurisdictions has been the introduction of legislation that equates ' unlawful striking causing death ' - the ' one punch attack ' to murder . The Queensland Safe Night Out Legislation Amendment Bill 2014 has introduced ' unlawful striking causing death ' into the Queensland Criminal Code . The offence carries the penalty of life imprisonment , the harshest maximum penalty currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hierarchy of offences . <p> More broadly and in the longer term , the existence of entertainment precincts such as Fortitude Valley , with their high concentration of licenses , which are conducive to alcohol fueled violence , should be questioned and reviewed . <p> Again for the long term , the education of the younger generation will be paramount . It is refreshing to see implementation of school programs that aim to shape an Australian culture where alcohol and violence are no longer tolerated . Maybe in the long-term overall approaches that include legal interventions , renewed urban planning and improved educational programs will ensure one punch attacks will be a thing of the past . <p> Professor Rosa Alati is an NHMRC Research Fellow at the School of Public Health and Centre for Youth Substance Abuse Research . <h> Related <p> Lance

 same , concerned citizens returned with their pickets on Monday , this time under the banner of Rural Australians for Refugees . <p> The demonstrators , seething inside at their government 's treatment of displaced people , remained mild-mannered during both rallies . <p> They cheered when passing cars tooted in approval at signs reading ' let them stay ' . <p> They discussed offshore processing with religious leaders who came to lend their voice of dissent . <p> They even performed a rendition of John Lennon 's Imagine . Harmless stuff , but still powerful . <p> So when disgruntled readers took to the Bendigo Advertiser Facebook page this week to share examples of how they were inconvenienced the protests , it was difficult to grant the authors any sympathy . <p> One reader bemoaned how the crowd disturbed her evening walk while another claimed protesters endangered lives by encroaching on View Street traffic . <p> Other critics of this week 's demonstrations said attending a rally did nothing meaningful for persecuted people , and protesters should be prepared to open their homes or just keep quiet . <p> Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would go away or even worse adopt an apathetic attitude to the the problem being picketed . <p> But those same critics are probably the same people who champion the Eureka Rebellion as a formative event in our history . <p> Protest has the potential to enact change , and while the gatherings in Bendigo this week might have be small , their sentiments were echoed by the voices of distressed Australians nation-wide , including many of our political leaders . <p> While we should not feel obliged to share their grievances , we must not begrudge people the chance to have their voices heard . <h> The global market

 sausages <p> Testing worth of supermarket sausage 36 varieties from the four major outlets was always going to be a challenge for our testers ' stomachs . <p> So why do it in the first place ? <p> Ask people for their opinions about what makes a great sausage and they either pull a face ( Why would you want to taste test sausages ? What 's the point ? ) , or they 'll say : The best ones are outside Bunnings . <p> The best ones are not outside Bunnings . <p> On the whole , those are budget-level slurry tubes . Because they are served hot , charred , covered in sauce , mustard and onions , and we are hungry when we buy one , they 're fine . As long as we do n't think about it too much . <p> But in the supermarket you 'll find dozens of varieties , from those sausage sizzle bulk packs to such exotica as Jamie Oliver 's " Italian-style veal and pork sausages with fennel and red wine " ( ) . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with how it 's been made , but at least at the level of which will taste best . <p> The top 10 sausages were also cooked on a Weber barbecue .

Is it worth spending more on the " gourmet " varieties ? <p> We put those questions to the taste test , and the results were quite surprising . <p> Aldi was the winning supermarket with four of their five own-brand sausages making the top 10 . <p> Coles was next with three varieties in the top 10 , Woolworths scored one , with two IGA supermarkets ( All Natural Sausage Company and Outback Spirit ) podium winners in first and third place , and a Jamie Oliver sausage at number two . <p> For our experiment , we visited a typical suburban Coles supermarket , a Woolworths , an Aldi and two local IGAs .

We gathered together nine tasters , who were directed to try every sausage " blind " ( each sample was assigned a number and plated identically ) , without bread or condiments , and to score out of 10 for appearance , aroma , casing , texture , meat-fat balance and overall flavour . <p> 2 . For the elimination round , we cooked the sausages in the oven .

Surprises were Jamie 's Classic Cumberland Pork Sausages bombing out ( " smells like armpit " ) , even though its stablemate ended up in second spot . <p> Despite Heston 's promise that his pork and sage sausages were " sensational " , our tasters did n't agree .

Nobody picked up the cider in the blind tasting , but several noted it tasted fruity , or of cinnamon or red wine .

" Nice and bland , " gushed one taster . " I feel like this is the most refreshing sausage , " wrote another . The key to its success was probably the visible herbs , which livened up an otherwise " mushy " looking interior and added much-needed flavour .

It browned up well , looked tasty ... and yet the flavour was slightly disappointing , one taster summarising it as " bland , salty and not much else going on " . " Not bad , not great , " said another . <h> 10 . Brannan 's Butchery ( Aldi-owned brand ) <p> Juicy Pork Sausages ( 32.2 ) <p> Damned by faint praise : our testers declared it " very processed , in a good way " , as seen at " a thousand fundraisers " .

 bullying of society 's most vulnerable <p> Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull must make a stand against far-right colleagues . <p> LABOR leader Bill Shorten 's misfiring " zingers " have long been the cause of much mirth within the electorate . <p> But last week Mr Shorten achieved the seemingly impossible and simultaneously landed solid blows to the jaws of two key Coalition figures . <p> The off-the-cuff retort " At least I 'm not a homophobe " directed at hyper-conservative Liberal senator Cory Bernardi packed more punch than anything Mr Shorten had said in months . <p> Its delivery and subsequent widespread dissemination across traditional and social media was greeted with a combination of elation and disbelief . <p> Mr Shorten had said in a rare , unscripted moment what the vast majority of Australians , including more than a few Coalition MPs , had longed to say . <p> In doing so , he not only called out the senator but chastised Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull for failing to condemn prejudice masked as policy . <p> Few politicians in recent memory can claim to have done less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transgender and intersex people than Senator Bernardi . <p> The senator from South Australia will , of course , wear that mantle with pride , but history if it even bothers to record his dubious exploits will judge him harshly . <p> Senator Bernardi 's latest crusade is an attempt to scrap the Safe Schools Coalition initiative .

 against expanding Safe Schools program to all Victorian classrooms <p> State Liberal leader Matthew Guy has backed Malcolm Turnbull 's review of the Safe Schools program and has warned against making the curriculum mandatory in Victoria , saying a one-size-fits-all approach wo n't work . <p> But the Victorian Opposition Leader has provoked a furious response after condoning the comments of Liberal MP Bernie Finn , who described the program this week as " a full-frontal assault on the innocence of children and the role of families in society " . <p> Almost two weeks after the Turnbull government announced a rethink of the Safe Schools anti-bullying initiative , Mr Guy has endorsed Canberra 's decision while hitting out at Premier Daniel Andrews ' plan to expand the program to every Victorian public school by 2018 . <p> " A one-size-fits-all approach in education does n't work ; schools and parents need to have input into what their kids are learning , " said the father of three . <p> " All school curriculum is very important so a review into the effectiveness of any program to make sure it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has my support . " <p> Safe Schools was piloted in Victoria in 2010 in a bid to tackle homophobia , and continued to receive funding under the Baillieu/Napthine governments without any vocal concerns from Coalition MPs . <p> However , with a marriage equality plebiscite looming , the program has come under federal fire recently amid claims that it indoctrinates children and promotes " the gay agenda " . <p> This week , state Liberal MPs also weighed into the debate , with parliamentary secretary Bernie Finn writing on his Facebook page : " The Safe Schools program has nothing to do with highlighting bullying . It is , in fact , a full-frontal assault on the innocence of children and the role of families in society . It should be cut immediately from all Victorian schools . " <p> Asked if he condoned Mr Finn 's comments , Mr Guy said we live in a democracy , and pointed instead to the comments of Safe Schools co-founder Roz Ward , who according to a News Corp report this week , had suggested it was part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a democracy and Bernie is entitled to be concerned about the comments made by Roz Ward as well as wanting greater parental involvement in children 's education , " Mr Guy said .

 estates to be clear at outset <p> By Shane 6 , 2016 , 6 p.m . <p> Council has plans for contribution tax to cover works . <p> LAND buyers will know at the point of purchase what infrastructure will be built in new housing estates and when it will be delivered under a City of Greater Bendigo plan aimed at speeding up development . <p> By the council 's own admission , development has at times been delayed and confusion has reigned due to a process in which housing estates have been approved before infrastructure plans have been locked in . <p> Prue Mansfield , the council 's planning and development director , said that was set to change with the introduction of " development contribution plans " . <p> The new system , to be used in upcoming developments in Marong and elsewhere , would require all owners of land slated for residential development to contribute to the cost of infrastructure in their area , she said . <p> The contributions effectively taxes and the infrastructure itself would be determined at the outset and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would know when roads , footpaths , drainage and playgrounds would be built . <p> " It involves quite a lot of work upfront about actually identifying what it is people need , what 's proposed for an area , " Ms Mansfield said . <p> " And all of the developments in that area actually contribute to the cost of those works . " <p> The council , Ms Mansfield added , had learned from recent development in such areas as Maiden Gully and Huntly that an infrastructure plan needed to be completed at the same time as an estate 's initial structure plan to avoid delays and uncertainty . <p> At Maiden Gully , a question had lingered about the best way to provide drainage , years after the area 's structure plan had been approved , Ms Mansfield said . <p> In some cases , " stand-offs " over who would pay for a main road used by neighbouring estates being built by multiple developers had delayed construction , she added . <p> " We 've had instances where development has not happened because person A says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody . ' <p> " And person B says : ' I 'm going to sit and wait for them to move ' , " she said . <p> " And it becomes a Mexican stand-off . <p> " There 's no doubt that some of the development actually bringing land on the market has been slower than it otherwise could have been because of the uncertainty , " she said . <p> " The reason we will have developer contributions is so that when people move into a new area , the infrastructure that they need and want can happen within a reasonable time frame . " <p> Ms Mansfield defended the tax at the point of sale , saying that the value of property rezoned for residential development amounted to a windfall for land owners . <p> " People 's value of their land went up a lot when it was rezoned for residential purposes . Some of that gets returned through the DCP , " she said . <p> " Infrastructure has to be paid for somehow , be it through a DCP or rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that locking in a tax for landowners at the point of subdivision would disadvantage " mum-and-dad " landowners . <p> The council last week identified 600 hectares of land north-west of Maiden Gully as Bendigo 's next big growth area . <p> The council believes there is enough land supply within the city 's existing urban growth boundary to last 15 years . <p> Annual audits will be undertaken to determine whether more land is needed . <p> In 2020 , the council will begin focusing on its next big growth front in areas between Maiden Gully and Eaglehawk . <p> " The council does not want Bendigo to fall victim to the urban sprawl that is impacting on the lives of people living on the outskirts of Melbourne where there is very little infrastructure and unbearable travel times into the CBD , " Mayor Rod Fyffe said . <p> Coastal shipping volumes

" <p> Political sailors are adept at weathering events , but no event in living memory is likely to be as unforgiving as the voters ' declining trust in the crew and the ships themselves . <p> The general trend , no matter the strength of any one politician , is stark : we do n't trust political parties or their representatives . The various surveys about our trust in politicians reveal the same trend - the Gallup Poll in the US , Ipsos Mori in Britain and Roy Morgan in Australia . <p> Since the 1970s , the major political parties have seen their power slip as the ground moves from underneath them .

 focus of city 's development <p> TWO important development stories in Bendigo this week will have produced markedly different emotions in the City of Greater Bendigo 's Planning Services offices . <p> On the one hand , the council has had cause to celebrate . Central Bendigo , it says , can prepare for a " renaissance " following planning minister Richard Wynne ( pictured ) approving planning scheme amendments that will allow for significant development along High Street and around the hospital . <p> Apartment-style development on High Street alone , from Shamrock Street to Short Street , has the potential to " unlock many tens of millions of dollars of investment " , Mayor Rod Fyffe says . <p> Deflating the mood a little at 15 Hopetoun Street , no doubt , has been an independent government panel 's findings relating to the council 's efforts to build an industrial park in Marong .

But these two cases are timely reminders that the city 's development priorities need to fall somewhere between promises of architectural beauty and the ugliness of a family battling for years to remain on their land . <p> That middle ground is a place where people 's best interests are the priority . It 's a place where people 's need for and right to adequate housing , be it public or private , shapes policy more than the interests of a select few developers . <p> It 's a place where the " tens of millions of dollars of investment " translate into affordable living for people in need of apartments close to town . Increasingly , that will be older couples looking to downsize and stay close to the revamped hospital precinct .

 Barnaby Joyce chartered a helicopter to visit an area less than an hour and a half by road from his ministerial office in Armidale . <p> The flight to Copeton Dam places a question mark over a key plank of the National leader 's defence of his helicopter usage , supported on Friday by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull , that choppers were used as an alternative to unreasonably long drives . <p> The most controversial helicopter flight in Australian political history , Bronwyn Bishop 's hop from Melbourne to a Liberal Party fundraiser in Geelong , was just 40 kilometres shorter . <p> Fairfax Media revealed on Thursday that Mr Joyce had taken two helicopter flights to visit the small New England community of Drake , 44 kilometres away from his second ministerial office in Tenterfield but a four hour drive away from his Tamworth home . <p> He took a fourth helicopter trip from Armidale to Legume near the Queensland border in February last year , according to parliamentary records for travel . <p> That flight , to announce a road upgrade , cost the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joyce 's office on Friday to withdraw its statement to Fairfax Media on Thursday that the two flights to Drake were his only helicopter usage since becoming the MP for New England in 2013 . <p> " Our statement was incorrect and we are going to correct it online , " said a spokesman . <p> The flight to Copeton Dam , taken in February 2014 , was to show Paul Fletcher , the then parliamentary secretary to then communications minister Malcolm Turnbull , the " lack of mobile phone coverage in the area " , a spokesman for Mr Joyce said . <p> " Due to other commitments a helicopter was chartered to maximise Mr Fletcher 's time on the ground , " he said . <p> In fending off criticism on Thursday , Mr Joyce said it was unfair to put the Drake trips in context of his nearby electorate office in Tenterfield because " I do n't sleep in my second electorate office " . <p> Minister Barnaby Joyce with wife Natalie , Tenterfield mayor Peter Petty and Lismore MP Thomas George at his Tenterfield office Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs expended on the Tenterfield and Armidale offices . <p> " Armidale is a lot easier for rural people to get to see me and ministerial staff than an office in the middle of Sydney , " he told the Tenterfield Star . <p> If Mr Joyce had driven from his home in Tamworth to Copeton Dam , the journey would be 200 kilometres or a little over two hours . <p> Asked about Mr Joyce 's flights to Drake on Friday , Mr Turnbull said the " aerial option " avoided a " very , very long car drive " . <p> " His electorate is , I think , 66,000 square kilometres , about a quarter of the size of Victoria . The travel , if he had gone by road , would have been , I think , about four hours or a bit more each way , " he said . <p> NSW National Party senator John Williams attacked Fairfax Media for questioning Mr Joyce 's Drake flights . " He 's done absolutely nothing wrong . If you want to shackle us back to using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see us , " he said . <p> Labor MP Pat Conroy said it was " extraordinary " that Mr Joyce took another helicopter flight two days after the release of a recent review of entitlements warning against the use of choppers . <p> " Barnaby has clearly learned nothing from the Bishop choppergate affair , " he said . <p> The review called for clear guidelines so the " use of charter transport must constitute value for money , and in particular that , in the absence of compelling reasons , helicopters can not be chartered to cover short distances " . <h> Why did Barnaby Joyce charter a helicopter to take him to a town 44 kilometres from his Tenterfield electorate office ?

 to a more sustainable city <p> April 9 , 2016 , 6 a.m . <p> EDITORIAL : Informed discussion about the role bikes can play in a more sustainable society is timely . <p> as an offence has its origins in 1920s America . A burgeoning motor industry , the story goes , railed against calls to have speed limits reduced by launching a counter-offensive that impelled authorities to fine people for crossing roads " unlawfully " . <p> The car had asserted itself as king and it has retained that title for the 90 years since . It has -- if you 'll pardon the pun driven many a public planning agenda . <p> Suburban sprawl has entrenched itself as a staple of modern society . Public transport systems have often failed to adequately connect people with their inner-city jobs . In big cities , gridlocked traffic and early-morning resignation that a one-hour commute is unavoidable has , like the car itself , reigned supreme . <p> Most Bendigo residents can take comfort in the knowledge they can avoid such commuter pain . Walking to work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But cars still remain king in Bendigo . We 're acutely aware of climate change but are buying cars at an increasing rate . We 've convinced ourselves that it does n't seem odd to drive around a seven-seat SUV with no passengers in it . <p> The Big Bike Bendigo Weekend , which began last night , reminds us there 's another way . Informed , intelligent discussion about the benefits of riding and the role bikes can play in a more sustainable society is timely . <p> Those benefits are many . Bike riding is not just for fitness fanatics with a competitive streak . It can be a way to save money , achieve better health or explore hidden parts of the region . Buying bikes instead of cars also drastically cuts emissions and , due to the amount of rubber used in motor vehicles , reduces forest destruction . <p> Debate often surrounds cyclists ' place on the roads . At the heart of the issue is safety and rightly so . <p> But this should not deter efforts to increase bike use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that more bike traffic results in safer not more dangerous -- roads . <p> Bendigo is well positioned to capitalise on the fact so many of its people live close enough to work or school to embrace riding . Discussions that promote a strong , community-focused riding culture must continue and be complemented by a better network of tracks and bike-friendly spaces . <p> Such a culture will prove a noble thing for the city even if it is the car that remains king . -- Shane Worrell , reporter <h> Andrew 's 
 he would kill me and the kids ' : the cycle of family violence and homelessness <p> The trauma was so great her lips turned black . Pinned down on the bed , Vicky ? thought she would die . <p> With his hand over her mouth and nose , her partner screamed his intentions . <p> " He was close to my face , spitting and saying he was going to kill me .

' I 'd be driving in tears , praying that we would get accommodation . " <p> Like many women fleeing family violence , Vicky struggled to find secure housing . With a shortage of affordable accommodation in Melbourne , she found a temporary home in country Victoria . But it isolated her from family and social networks and soon she moved back to the city to live with her sister . <p> She contacted a major housing service and was told she would have to move out of her sister 's place and be homeless before they could find her a place to live . <p> It was one of many bureaucratic barriers she faced during the long battle to find a permanent home . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned 10 and they did not accept boys past that age . <p> Vicky moved to a motel . For months she and her children flitted from motel to refuge to motel . It was 2005 when she left her husband , but only in the last few years has she secured permanent housing . <p> " It 's very hard to break out of that cycle . You 're labelled , as a homeless person . It does n't matter what you have done in your past life that is all forgotten , nobody ever asks you if you have talents or skills . You lose confidence and self esteem . I had suicidal thoughts . I felt that maybe I should give my kids to someone else . " <p> She believes the properties acquired by the government for the defunct East-West Link would allow women fleeing family violence to escape from the cycle of homelessness . <p> " It would have made a difference to me and my boys . They 've felt that we 've been in poverty and that has a big effect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live comfortably and not had to worry about where we were sleeping at night .

 The most offensive travel invention ? <p> The birth of " smart " phones means that a lot of dumb people can take photos in crazy situations . <p> I realised recently that , despite all my travels , I had few photographs of myself in exotic locations . <p> Part of this is my aversion to taking what is now known as a " selfie " . I attempt the occasional one , but the selfie has had such a bad rap lately , I find it embarrassing to be caught in public pouting into my camera screen and turning my head to get the best angle . <p> I 'm pretty much alone in this , I think . In Tokyo recently , I could n't see the Meiji Shrine for hoards of young girls taking photos of themselves in their new spring finery . <p> I 've often wondered if future societies will look back at this time and wonder what on earth we were doing , just as that old TV show Talkin Bout My Generation pitted Gen Y against the Baby Boomers in trying to guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look particularly stupid .

" He just shrugged OK , so I stood by him and smiled for the camera while a stewardess did the snap . It has to be the best selfie ever . " <p> Actually , if the flight attendant took the photo ( and what 's the story with her ? ) it 's not technically a " selfie " . Even so , Innes ' breathtaking moxie in pulling off this stunt caused a lot of expected outrage throughout the world . <p> Security experts were horrified that Innes could put the other passengers in such danger , especially as his profession is noted as " health and safety auditor " .

 friends say Kelly Thompson , 43 , was always the first to dream up ideas , invite people along , share her life with those she loved . <p> But in her last days the Point Cook woman was also terrified , stalked by her obsessive , jealous ex-partner , Wayne Wood . <p> Such was her distress that on her last night alive Ms Thompson fell asleep with three kitchen knives on her bedside table , a talisman against fear . <p> Her body was found in her home in February 2014 , after Wood broke into her home , stabbed her to death and then took his own life . <p> In the Coroners Court on Thursday a white-framed photograph of Ms Thompson in a ruby-red shirt smiled down on the small group of family and friends who gathered to hear Judge Ian Gray deliver his findings on her murder . <p> " In terms of her interaction with the family violence system , Ms Thompson took all the right steps , " he said . <p> Yet time after time the system failed her . <p> Ms Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own intervention order , after Wood attempted to strangle her and chased her in his car . <p> Organised and whip-smart , she tried everything .

 Bendigo still teach Shakespeare 400 years after his death <p> MARK 22 , 2016 , 6 p.m . <p> That is the question . <p> " No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en . In brief , sir , study what you most affect , " wrote William Shakespeare in his comedy , The Taming of the Shrew . <p> In other words : do n't study anything you will not enjoy . <p> And yet , despite the groans of students throughout the English-speaking world , schools continue to place a high value on work by the Elizabethan bard . <p> Saturday marks 400 years since the death of Shakespeare , whose plays and poems are on the text list of all seven Bendigo secondary schools the Advertiser contacted . <p> Catholic College Bendigo students perform an excerpt of Romeo and Juliet <p> Bendigo South East College head of English Trish Di Donato has a mission for no student to leave her school without being exposed to Shakespeare 's work . <p> She said the bard was critical to understanding the human condition . <p> " For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can still relate to aspects of that today , " she said . <p> The same sentiment was shared by Catholic College Bendigo English head Kate Watts , whose school places such a high value on the bard 's body of work it awards an annual Shakespeare Shield to the student with the best essay about his plays . <p> " The themes that are in the plays , especially in Romeo and Juliet and Macbeth , they 're universal : love , fate , power , leadership , betrayal , " she said . <p> " Although he wrote in the 16th century , these things have n't changed . " <p> Unsurprisingly , the play taught most frequently in the city 's schools is Romeo and Juliet , a script Victory Christian College teacher Sally Spark calls " the stock standard year 10 introduction to Shakespeare " . <p> But while girls were won over by the play 's romance , she said teenage boys were harder to impress , so her classes focus on its elements of tragedy and comedy . <p> Splitting into two sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clans , even firing upon each other with nerf guns . <p> " If they 've got props and costumes , and if they 're having a giggle and a laugh , then they enjoy it , " she said . <p> Bell Shakespeare associate director James Evans , whose theatre company performs Elizabethan plays around Australia to students and adult audience , said the playwright 's language came alive on the stage . <p> He approved of Romeo and Juliet as an entryway into Shakespeare , but cautioned teachers to avoid making their classes read the play like it was a book . <p> " These are n't novels , they 're plays , " he said . <p> " They should be getting up and experiencing what its like . " <p> He said his company 's productions had not only broken down the barrier to understanding old-fashioned language , but even inspired some students to pursue a performing career . <p> " What we do is give the kids a visceral and an emotional experience of the play , not just the dry and academic versions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she relied on visual versions of Shakespeare , like Baz Luhrmann 's 1996 Romeo + Juliet , to win over her class . <p> But she said it was not just students struggling with Shakespeare , explaining some teachers were also daunted by the teaching his work . <p> " There is a genuine fear with teachers , " she said . <p> " They think its too difficult and they do n't feel they 're qualified . " <p> La Trobe University education department academic Dr Debra Edwards said teachers ' fear stemmed from their own negative experiences of studying the texts . <p> She said teacher training at the Bendigo campus ensured future educators were exposed to resources that broke down difficult texts like Shakespearean plays . <p> " Understanding how to introduce the text , how to orientate students to the text , is easier now there 's a vast range of resources out there , " she said , including contemporary interpretations like the film 10 Things I Hate About You , which is a modern retelling of The Taming of the Shrew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms Di Donato is right in her assumption that Shakespeare will always feature on English students ' book lists . <h> By Melissa Reddy

What took Mr Borella six weeks to complete , the 21st century travelling party did in just ten days . <p> He eventually spent two years on the Western Front , and was awarded his Victoria Cross medal after his platoon of about 30 men fended off 150 German foes at Villers-Bretonneux , today the site of an Australian war memorial . <p> " I 've been to where he was awarded his VC and I do n't know how he survived , " Mr Chalmers said . <p> " It must 've been hell on earth .

" <p> Mr said 60,000 Australians were killed during World War I , 150,000 were wounded and many more were left scarred mentally and emotionally . <p> " This morning our own reflection brings us to this moment at the Bendigo cenotaph to make sure we never forget , " he said . <p> Bendigo District RSL sub-branch president Cliff Richards said the dawn service commemorated a century of remembrance , making special reference to the Vietnam War , with this year marking the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan . <p> He said service men and women today continued to embrace and uphold the Anzac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The manner in which way wars are being fought has changed , but the freedoms we currently enjoy are no different to the freedoms our forefathers so gallantly fought for , " Mr Richards said . <p> He said Anzac Day was not about the glorification of war , but an opportunity to pause and reflect on the 102,000 Australian lives that had been lost in service of the country . <p> Mr Richards told the Bendigo Advertiser it was pleasing to see such a large turnout for the dawn service . <p> " It 's a nice feeling because it tells not only myself but all veterans on parade today that the memory of the Anzacs will continue for another century , " he said . <p> During the service poet Peter Worthington delivered a poem entitled ' The Anzacs Serving Side by Side ' , an ode to the service of men and women who have served in conflicts since the Gallipoli landing more than a century ago . <p> " Over the last 101 years , the Anzacs have served us with pride , " Mr Worthington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , <p> " The Aussies and the Kiwis , serving side by side . <p> " Lest we forget .

 the company which wants to restart gold mining in Bendigo says groundwater rising through the city 's network of abandoned and disused mines is the state government 's responsibility . <p> GBM Gold chief executive officer John Harrison said the city 's modern phase of mining had not contributed to the problem , which will lead to water laced with arsenic and rotten egg gas spilling into the city 's waterways if nothing is done . <p> GBM is seeking state government approval for its bid to acquire mining licences for Bendigo from Unity Mining . But Mr Harrison refuted claims by Unity Mining 's Environment Review Committee , councillor Peter Cox , that the company had an obligation to contribute to a solution for the issue of groundwater . <p> However members of the ERC argue that Unity although it did n't create the problem significantly contributed to it . <p> ERC community representative for Eaglehawk , Ian Magee , said last week that Unity 's new mines on higher ground than those which run through central Bendigo had contributed between 30 to 40 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ERC alone in being concerned about GBM 's ability to meet the costs of post-mining rehabilitation , should the transfer be approved . <p> The mayor of Bendigo has written to the mining minister asking her not to approve the transfer of a mining licence unless she is fully confident the company has a plan and can afford to finance a full rehabilitation of the sites . <p> Last month mayor Rod Fyffe wrote Minister Lily D'Ambrosio saying he " considered critical " that she ensured GBM had adequate resources in place to carry out " the long promised rehabilitation of the key sites of the Bendigo gold project " . <p> " Council notes that an applicant must satisfy the minister it has an appropriate program of work and ' is likely to be able to finance the proposed work and rehabilitation of the land ' and urges you to give this matter deep consideration in regard to the proposed transfer , " Cr Fyffe wrote . <p> " Further , council strongly recommends that the transfer not proceed unless you are fully satisfied that adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community standards . <p> " Council believes the most appropriate method for ensuring this is to exercise your powers under Section 33 ( 3 ) to require that the work plan include a detailed closure and rehabilitation plan for each site that is fully costed and that this figure is reflected in the rehabilitation bond . " <p> GBM chief executive officer John Harrison responded by saying GBM had always , and would continue to " do things by the book " . <p> " Unity already had a plan to rehabilitate the site and the million bond covers that , " Mr Harrison said . <p> " We 've done everything required of us , in a legal sense . <p> " The real question is , if GBM does n't take over what will be done there ? <p> " If we are out of picture , what 's to stop Unity selling to somebody else ?

 needs budgetary solutions <p> Jessica 1 , 2016 , 7 a.m . <p> Heard the one about how Australia is suddenly suffering a bout of deflation ? Well , it 's simply not true . Not yet . Not even close . <p> DECISION TIME : The Reserve Bank board may decide to lend some more marginal support to the economy by pulling the trigger at its monthly meeting tomorrow after keeping rates on ice at record lows for the past year . <p> Heard the one about how Australia is suddenly suffering a bout of deflation ? Well , it 's simply not true . Not yet . Not even close . <p> This latest economic bogyman reared its ugly head last Wednesday after the release of official prices data . <p> It is true that an index of most commonly purchased consumer items fell by 0.2 per cent in the first three months of the year . The prices of some things , like health and education , rose . But , on average , prices fell . <p> But one quarter does not deflation make . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our economy grew a solid three per cent last year , only a bit below average . <p> And our jobless rate is falling , albeit wages growth remains elusive . <p> Looked at over the year , prices are still rising , by 1.3 per cent . When you strip out more volatile items , key measures of core inflation rose by an average of 1.55 per cent . <p> What we are seeing is not deflation , but a slowing in the pace of prices growth . The technical term for that is " disinflation " . <p> Globally , interest rates policy has become a race to the bottom as economies have struggled in the post-GFC world . <p> A race to drop one 's pants is not one a respectable central bank would wish to win . <p> And so far , Australia 's central bank has remained as a beacon of modesty in a world of unconventional monetary policy . <p> For decades now , Australia has consistently sported interest rates higher than the rest of the world . <p> Why ? On a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earn a higher rate of return on money here . <p> We 're a developed nation , open to foreign investment ( for all the noise ) , with a stable democracy ( for all the noise ) and a wealthy and relatively well-educated population . <p> Our higher interest rates have , however , put us in an uncomfortable position of late . Investors looking to park their money have been buying up Australian assets , using Australian dollars , and this has pushed up our currency . <p> Some argue the Reserve Bank should cut interest rates in an attempt to reduce the value of the dollar and revive prospects for inbound tourism and education services . <p> But cutting our cash rate even by a full half percentage point , to 1.5 per cent , would still leave us sticking out like a sore thumb in a world of zero or sub-zero borrowing rates . <p> The Reserve Bank has so far held off joining this race to the bottom . To join it now , so late after the starting gun was fired , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lend some more marginal support to the economy by pulling the trigger at its monthly meeting tomorrow after keeping rates on ice at record lows for the past year . <p> Or it may decide to stick to its guns and the belief that high borrowing costs are not the thing holding the Australian economy back . <p> A lack of business confidence , the excessive returns to rent-seeking above other more productive investments , tax incentives which divert investment towards non-productive sectors , like property speculation , and under-investment in skills remain the real impediments to stronger growth in the Australian economy . <p> And those problems can only be solved in the budget lockup , not at the Reserve 's board meeting in Martin Place . <p> Indeed , if a rate cut fuelled a sense of uncertainty and fear over the economic outlook , dropping rates may do more harm than good . <p> Bouts of torrential

 place for family fun <p> A daughter rang me recently to ask : " Mum , in all seriousness how could you have allowed us all to play in the Spring Gully bush for hours during holidays ? What if there were paedophiles out there ? " <p> I replied : " How could I have stopped you ? That was your playground and we parents all knew you were safe . After all , you were the mighty Famous Five or the Secret Seven , depending on numbers on the day . " <p> What our children never realised was that occasionally a parent would stroll up to their bush huts at the end of the street to check on them . That was as much observing as they needed . <p> No paedophiles would ever choose to confront that formidable clan which included at least four families in the street . <p> The world is a different place today .

It was a beautiful day and Macedon was cloaked in the glorious colours of autumn . <p> My enjoyment came in watching our eight grandchildren climb to the summit . They did not draw breath . Every rock that could be scaled was scaled . <p> A delightful scene I will remember was of our youngest grandchild belting up the track as fast as her little legs could carry her , laughing gleefully while behind her relatively fit dad struggling manfully to keep up with her .... and failing dismally in the race . <p> Later the children fearlessly a tree that had fallen carelessly across a deep gully . <p> This was children at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proscribed , nothing artificial , with that magnificent rock standing sentinel , guarding its environment , as it had since time immemorial . <p> Despite the huge influx of tourists who were discovering the challenges of this very steep walk , testing their knees again on the trek down , there was a strange calmness , a hush over this beautiful scene . <p> There is a sense of sacredness , an aura that transcends the daily trippers who come to marvel at its wildness . <p> The rock is steeped in history echoing through thousands of years , and of aborigines who once inhabited this beautiful wild region . Before them , who knows what animals roamed these wild rocky outcrops . <p> I never fail to recall the film which I maintain is arguably the greatest film ever made in Australia , Picnic at Hanging Rock . <p> The evocativeness of the surroundings , the haunting music of the panpipes , the intrinsic fear we have of wild places , the mysterious disappearance of the schoolgirls all resonate with me whenever I return to Hanging Rock . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today believe it was based on a true story .

 evening in which councillors adopted a year-long plan and a million budget to fund it but , according to one councillor at least , the most difficult decision at tonight 's meeting related to an million loan . <p> City of Greater Bendigo councillors voted tonight to act as guarantor for Bendigo Stadium Limited as it seeks loans to fund the construction of a new three-court arena capable of seating 4,000 people . <p> Councillor Barry Lyons who is on the BSL board said council would only be at risk " if the sky falls in " but would save money for the BSL by reducing interest rates on their loans . <p> " It 's not risk free , but it 's so minimal that I support the guarantee , " Cr Lyons said . <p> But councillor Peter Cox argued the decision be deferred until more research was done on the potential savings if council acted as a guarantor . He cited a million blowout on the project as a reason to be concerned about " locking future councils " into the role as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks lower interest rates if council acts as guarantor , " Cr Cox said . <p> " But we have n't got a report in front of us detailing all that information , that 's what I 'm disappointed about . <p> " I personally think the process has broken down . <p> " We are committing future councils to an million loan but we do n't know what 's going to happen in the future .

 to be dependent on parents <p> The prime minister has a perfect suggestion : get mummy and daddy to stump up for your house . <p> POCKET MONEY : Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is spruiking parents buying houses for their children as a solution to the housing affordability issue . <p> Hey , Australia ! Feeling blue about the staggering price of property ? Are you looking at statistics revealing that Sydney home buyers are looking at spending 12.7 years of household income to pay for shelter or submit to a lifetime of asset-free rental uncertainty ? <p> Then stop whining about it , because the prime minister has a perfect suggestion : get mummy and daddy to stump up for your house ! Now , you might be thinking " hey , does n't the idea of demanding one 's parents buy one a house sound a wee bit at odds to that whole ' live within our means ' rhetoric , let alone all that ' the end of the age of entitlement ' stuff the Coalition has been going on about to justify cuts to services ever since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misunderstanding of what " entitlement " means , silly ! See , as we 've learned over the past two and a half years , " entitlement " is " expecting to get into higher education on merit " , or " having mental health services available in times of crisis " , or " being able to access legal advice " . <p> In fact , let 's take a multigenerational case study of just one absolutely typical Australian family : Bruce T. is a single father who dotes on his only child , Malcolm . Despite struggling with the living hell that is living in a series of rented beachfront properties for a few years , the real estate speculator manages to scrape together enough to send Malcolm to one of Sydney 's finest and most expensive schools , where the precocious tyke gets an excellent education and also makes valuable contacts that will serve him well through the rest of his life . <p> After years of free tertiary study at one of the world 's greatest universities thanks to the Whitlam government 's education reforms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get sweet business opportunities and while he struggles with the notoriously low salaries afforded journalists and lawyers , he still somehow manages to scrimp and save enough to buy his own property in cash , inherit an estimated million property portfolio from his late father Bruce in 1982 , and upgrade to a more fashionable mansion which was bought directly from a friendly media mogul . <p> And thus , using only his own two hands and the sweat of his brow , Malcolm somehow made something of himself , making the sort of investment decisions that are available to all Australians of every background , provided that they have millions of dollars and families with excellent political and business contacts befitting a man married to a wife whose father was a former federal Attorney-General . <p> So sure , unkind commentators might be looking at Turnbull 's comments and thinking they seem wildly out of touch with the experience of all but the most blinkered and privileged , not to mention politically tin-eared given the class war tenor of the recent budget , but that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prime minister demanded sympathy for his own " mortgage stress " in paying for his luxurious Sydney pad ?

" <p> Cr Ruffell said a push similar to the Believe in Bendigo campaign was needed to show community support for CBD traders besieged by badly behaved youth . <p> " Let people come out and say ' we believe in our shop owners in the CBD and the mall and let 's push the troublemakers out ' , " she said . <p> Cr Ruffell said her business , Ruffell Jewellers , had not been based in the mall for nearly three years , but the stories she heard from current traders were all too familiar . <p> " In the 26-and-a-half years that we were in the mall we saw three different generations , " she said . <p> " I 've been hearing the same story for nearly 30 years and all that 's happened is the generations have changed , but this generation 's just got a bit nastier I 'll say , and we do n't want the community to be afraid of them , I do n't want to be afraid of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the meeting and agreed the issue was nothing new , but encouraged discussion around the social factors that led to youth disengagement . <p> " It 's not an issue that 's going to be solved overnight , I think young people have been hanging around the street for ever and a day , " he said . <p> " I 'd be particularly interested to know , is this the time of year when young people have been perhaps at school for three or four months into the year and how they 're coping with that and whether attendances have dropped off . <p> " They 're the issues and the discussions we need to have . " <p> Cr Cox said tackling root causes was the most effective way to address youth issues . <p> " It 's not only council , but it 's all the different agencies and organisations , " he said . <p> " The most important thing is that council and those agencies engage young people in the sort of activities that they would like to undertake , so that 's providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <h> What are the

I just could n't bear it . " <p> Customer comments in the report include descriptions of " 100 degree hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chest and both arms " , a child who was burnt by hot sauce when a machine spilled open , and another customer who had minor facial , shoulder and chest scarring . <p> " Under ACCC 's mandatory reporting guidelines a supplier must provide written notice to the Commonwealth Minister for consumer affairs within two days of becoming aware that someone suffered a serious injury or illness that was caused ( or may have been caused ) by the use or foreseeable misuse of their product , " said CHOICE spokesman Tom Godfrey . <p> " Based on the incidents identified in our report , it appears Thermomix should have made at least two mandatory reports before October 2014 and another eight after that date . " <p> In its October 2014 voluntary recall announcement , Thermomix noted an issue with some TM31 machines , where hot liquid could splash out if food was pureeing at speeds of four or above when the ' lid open " function was activated . <p> As a result Vorwerk , the manufacturer of Thermomix , replaced the sealing ring of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be replaced every two years . <p> However , according to CHOICE , consumers using the replacement green sealing ring were still harmed . <p> " Four of the serious burns cases documented in the mass incident report were from people already using the green sealing ring .

" <p> A spokesperson for Thermomix said the " safety , wellbeing and support " of its 300,000 Australian customers " was and always will be " the highest priority . <p> " Vorwerk , the manufacturer , is in contact with the relevant authorities regarding these matters . It would not be appropriate to comment further at this time .

" <p> Since her accident , Mrs Kerry said her Thermomix " scares the life out of her , " but she still " loves it .

 ; forced to merge <p> NSW : Wollongong and Shellharbour councils will be forced to merge while Kiama and Shoalhaven will left to stand alone . <p> Wollongong and Shellharbour councils will be forced to merge while Kiama and Shoalhaven will left to stand alone , the NSW Government will announce on Thursday . <p> The decision , which comes after months of campaigning since merger proposals were revealed in December , will leave residents in different parts of the Illawarra with vastly disparate access to local representation . <p> Kiama , which the government 's proposal says has a population of 21,314 , would have one councillor per 2368 residents if the status quo of nine councillors remains . <p> In stark contrast , a merged council would have citizens , according to government figures . <p> With 13 councillors , that 's 21,197 residents ( almost the entire population of Kiama ) represented by each councillor . <p> Reacting to media reports on Wednesday night , an emotional and defiant Shellharbour mayor Marianne Saliba said " the fight is n't over " , as she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop the merger . <p> Lord Mayor Gordon Bradbery said he was not surprised the merger would go ahead as he believed Wollongong and Shellharbour had been " easy pickings because we 're a Labor dominated area " . <p> Kiama 's Brian Petschler said he had received no formal advice about the government 's decision , but said he would be " absolutely delighted " . He credited the community 's strong case and unwavering anti-merger campaign for the result . <p> Kiama MP Gareth Ward was unavailable for comment on Wednesday night . <p> Details of the merger plans , including decisions about administrators , timeframes and interim council structures will be revealed on Thursday . <h> WHAT THEY SAID <p> Lord Mayor Gordon Bradbery <p> Wollongong Lord Mayor Gordon Bradbery <p> " Even though I do n't think the numbers stack up , I think the government wanted to pick on councils in Labor dominated areas , so we were easy picking . <p> " Kiama must have put up a good case to argue for their exemption , but I think every government is political and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that did have something to do with it . " <p> " Unless the government is prepared to allow councillors in the merged council to be paid better because of the demands on their time and expectations of the workload will be so much larger , this will be a big ask and demand on those councillors . They need to spend the time the community expects on their various responsibilities which will be immense as the merger of policies and strategies of two councils goes ahead . " <p> Marianne Saliba . <p> Shellharbour mayor Marianne Saliba <p> " I 'm shocked , absolutely devastated it is totally unfair and undemocratic . It 's absolute rubbish for me to be finding out that Kiama , a municipality of 21,000 has been saved , while a city of 67,000 people is being merged . <p> " We have legal action pending and the state government do n't have the right to take this action . I think is a political decision . " <p> Brian <p> Kiama mayor Brian <p> " I have had no formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are I 'm absolutely delighted . <p> " I would think this proposal down here did not stack up , and our case made by the community here was so persuasive that it has had the effect that this should n't proceed .

 what matters to you ? <p> May 14 , 2016 , 2 a.m . <p> Small towns need strong representation , and someone in a position of power to not only listen , but care and take action . <p> The Parliament of Australia describes a backbench member as someone who is expected to be a spokesperson for local interests ; an ombudsman and facilitator who deals with concerns about government matters ; a law maker ; an examiner of the work of the government and how it spends the money it raises from taxation ; and a contributor to debates on national issues . <p> Those elected with support of a political party are also expected to participate in party activities . <p> The role of a backbencher is to support their constituents ' interests ; lobby on their behalf , make representations to ministers and champion causes and needs in their communities . <p> They are the voice for their regions . <p> Yet , often during election campaigns , hopeful candidates forget that role and forget to do the listening . <p> They get busy preaching party policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their voices be heard . <p> As the daily newspaper servicing central Victoria , we will be monitoring our coverage in the coming weeks to ensure we capture what people in our region want and expect from their representatives . <p> And we will give as many towns as possible the chance to have their say on what matters to them , and why . <p> Elected representatives provide a direct link between their communities and the parliament , and we want to ensure whomever represents central Victoria in the next parliament can give our the region the voice it deserves . <p> Towns such as Heathcote need strong representation , and someone in a position of power to not only listen , but care and take action . <p> Like many small towns , there are positives in Heathcote -- grass roots leadership is at its best in small communities where volunteers are the backbone . Often , too much is left to too few and the task becomes too big . <p> The reality for many small towns is that issues of unemployment , the rising cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are escalating and trapping people into generational poverty . <p> These towns and the people living in them , matter . <p> They deserve the same level of attention as those living in major regional centres . <h> Stephen Crafti <p>

Sharing the digs is Angus the kelpie . Out the back is the neighbourhood sheep . <p> They wo n't be the only family in Bendigo confused and angry over the rate rise . <p> This year the state government set its much vaunted rate cap at 2.5 per cent . However , it coincided with a property revaluation year , upon which councils calculate their rates . The result is that , while the City of Greater Bendigo as a whole will raise its rates by 2.5 per cent , some neighbourhoods will pay more than that , while others will pay less . <p> Speaking at the release of the city 's property valuations last month , city organisation support director Kerryn Ellis said she would be " very surprised " if people were n't confused when they received their rates . Councils across the state have blamed the state government for the state of affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When council released its draft 2016-17 Budget this month , the document revealed just how confused ratepayers of Bendigo should be . <p> The budget provides a breakdown of the valuation change for each suburb in Greater Bendigo , along with the corresponding rate change . <p> Twenty eight suburbs are set to see their rates decrease on last year . Jackass Flat ratepayers would see their rates dropped by 5.8 per cent , while in Myers Flat that decrease would be 5.5 per cent . For the 12 properties in Eaglehawk North , it would be 2.9 per cent . <p> Under the draft budget , more than 3000 properties in Bendigo would see a rate increase of 8.3 per cent , while 1109 properties in Quarry Hill and 104 properties in South would see an increase of more than 6 per cent . <h> By Ben Hayward 
 ponders where to now after hiding from North Bendigo <p> WHITE Hills ' dramatic decline in the Heathcote District Football League continued on Saturday when the Demons suffered their biggest loss for 21 years , leaving coach Carl Hardingham to ponder where to now ? <p> TEMPERS FLARE : There was no love lost between North Bendigo 's Sam Barnes ( No.11 ) and White Hills ' Jake Ward during this third quarter scuffle on Saturday . The Bulldogs thrashed the Demons by 183 points . Picture : LUKE WEST <p> The Demons were humiliated on their home ground by North Bendigo by 183 points as they kicked just one goal in a 28.24 ( 192 ) to 1.3 ( 9 ) hiding . <p> It was the biggest loss for the Demons since they were beaten by 224 points by Mount Pleasant in round 2 , 1995 . <p> Having made it to the second week of the finals last year , the Demons are now 1-5 , with their average losing margin 99 points . <p> " It was an atrocious performance by the boys today , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past couple of weeks we had started to play some competitive footy that still was n't consistent enough , but was at least competitive . <p> " But today from the start of the game we just got a footy lesson in contested ball and willingness to work as a team . <p> " It was very disappointing in the way we performed . There 's no excuses and it just comes down to lack of effort and probably only two or three who wanted to have a red-hot crack . <p> " Where to from here is the big question and something I need to reflect on over the next couple of days . <p> " I 'm definitely not giving up , but we need to get back to some hard work . <p> " We 've got a few guys who are just willing to turn up on a Saturday and not do the extra work required during the week , which we 've spoken about today .

Some of that is due to form , a lot of that is due to injury , but that does n't excuse a lack of effort , which is what we had today and ca n't stand for as a club . " <h> Six vehicles torched 
 multiple new players from around the world has dramatically changed Australia 's comparatively small media landscape which has traditionally been limited to a small number of dominant companies . <p> " I think that the best media companies are the ones that do think global , " Mr Miller told Fairfax Media . <p> " You look at websites in March that had an audience of a million or more , there were 25 of them , 14 of those were local , 11 of them were international . You 're talking about BuzzFeed , The Guardian , Daily Mail and a number of others who have a significant presence here . Those international players are now in our market and we need to be thinking as well that we need to be in global markets . " <p> Mr Miller said he believed all of NewsMediaWorks ' members , of which Mr Miller is chairman , Fairfax , News Corp , West Australian Newspapers ( WAN ) and APN News &amp; Media have the capabilities to expand overseas . <p> " My own company , News Corp , has clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borders . " <h> Local focus <p> But , while many international media companies have struggled to make a profit in the Australian market , Mr Miller said the key was focusing on local news . <p> " There 's a unique difference between those companies and what we do . When I say we , I 'm talking about News Corp , Fairfax , WAN and APN in this , that we are serving local communities , " Mr Miller said . <p> " What makes us unique is community-oriented journalism and a lot of those international players have global journalism but what people are really looking for is contextual information and news at a local level and that 's what we do so well . " <p> The comments came as the newly-branded industry body NewsMediaWorks said the newspaper businesses was massively undervalued , providing new figures , in collaboration with Standard Media Index , to show industry advertising revenue was at billion in 2015 , a year-on-year slide of 6.7 per cent . <p> All companies involved have agreed to disclose advertising revenue directly negotiated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookings . <p> Mr Miller said the News Media Index ( NMI ) would help the newspaper industry by providing " first of all , confidence " . <p> " Having an independently verified figure actually helps give confidence to advertisers in our medium and in our companies , " he said . <p> " I hope there 's a rebalance and a reconsideration . We 're fighting for our share of that total pie , and their share figures and these trend figures argue that we should be getting a bigger share of main media and also local media dollars .

 to be an exciting reality <p> Marita 16 , 2016 , 9:09 a.m . <p> When I first heard about the Victorian government 's plans for Tech Schools , I was an instant fan . The million initiative taps into my passion for engaging young people in STEM education and using technology to inspire learning . <p> PASSIONATE : Former Young Australian of the Year and robotics entrepreneur Marita Cheng said she was excited to see 10 Victorian Tech Schools come to life and youth further inspired by high tech , STEM ( science , technology , engineering , maths ) rich possibilities . <p> This Education Week we are celebrating technology , technology that changes lives . It 's certainly changed mine . As a teenager , my mother nagged me to do the household chores and I dreamt of having a robot to do it for me . Now - just over 10 years later -- I build robots and it 's a job I love . <p> Through my company , 2Mar Robotics , I build robots that help people in their everyday lives . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences ; I travel the world , while making a world of difference to people with disabilities who use our robots . <p> By studying STEM ( that 's science , technology , engineering and maths ) subjects at school , and then at university , I have the kinds of skills needed for a high tech job like this . <p> We all know the world is changing . All the research shows that STEM skills , knowledge and training are what young people are going to need in the globally competitive workplace of the future . International research indicates that three-quarters of the fastest growing jobs require STEM skills and knowledge . <p> That 's why I am such a fan of doing all we can to excite the next generation , today 's young people , about STEM - whether it 's through running an Education Week full of technology focused activities , setting up Robogals , an organisation I founded to teach young girls about robotics , or by establishing Tech Schools , ten cutting edge learning centres across Victoria which will offer high schools students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the future . <p> When I first heard about the Victorian government 's plans for Tech Schools , I was an instant fan . The million initiative taps into my passion for engaging young people in STEM education and using technology to inspire learning . <p> These Tech Schools , which will open in 2017 and 2018 , will be nothing like the Tech Schools of the past . Rather , they 'll be high tech , modern facilities hosted by TAFEs and universities , with input from local businesses and industry , where students from surrounding schools come to explore science and technology . Unlike the Tech Schools of the past , these new training opportunities will be offered alongside regular schooling , so students wo n't have to choose between the two . <p> Tech Schools will be locally focused and industry will be an integral partner . This will ensure education programs offered at Tech Schools are relevant to the skills that employers in the area need . I have chosen to become the Tech Schools Ambassador , to put my name to this initiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , passionately . <p> My mum had plans for me to be a doctor . But then , in my last year of high school , I went on a four day engineering camp . It blew my mind . Before the camp , I had never thought of studying engineering . But I was inspired and I began to think , " I can do that ! " <p> I know that exposing young people to hands-on practical learning in industries of the future works -- because it worked for me . I know that sparking a young person 's curiosity can transform their life because it transformed mine . I am excited for the future , to see these 10 Tech Schools come to life , to see the vision become a reality , and to see our young people further inspired by high tech , STEM rich possibilities . <h> - Marita is a former Young Australian on the Year who is a robotics entrepreneur and a proponent of teaching science and technology . @ <h> A First Draft

 against dairy giant Murray Goulburn <p> Australia 's biggest milk producer Murray Goulburn and its board is being sued by investors for allegedly misleading investors ahead of its float last year . <p> The class action was filed in the Supreme Court of Victoria just days after it emerged members of the board of the milk producer were allegedly aware it was not meeting its targets months before informing the market . <p> Investor advocate , Mark Elliott who recently won a class action on behalf of investors in Downer EDI lodged the claim on behalf of investor John Webster , who will act as " lead plaintiff " in the case on behalf of other investors who join the action . <p> The class action alleges the company and its directors including chairman Phil Tracy and former chief executive Gary Helou were aware it " did not have reasonable grounds for making the misleading PDS representations " at the time it embarked on its million pre float raising . <p> It is also alleged the company breached its continuous disclosure obligations by not telling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including as early as at its October annual general meeting . <p> A spokeswoman for Murray Goulburn said the company did not consider it had any issues with its continuous disclosure regime or the statements made in its product disclosure statements . <p> She added the company was limited in what it could say because it was yet to be served with the claim . <p> Murray Goulburn 's share price plummeted on April 27 after it slashed its profit forecasts in late April on the back of weakened demand for its milk powder products in China . <p> The fallout of Murray Goulburn 's profit downgrade was made worse for Australia 's dairy farmers who supply the company . <p> They were told the farm gate price of milk would be lowered from for every kilogram of milk solids to a kilogram after Murray Goulburn had overestimated the value of the milk . Adding to the pain was Murray Goulburn 's decision to backdate the lower milk price for the 2015/2016 and to warn farmers that milk prices would remain low for another three years to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Murray Goulburn floated a little less than a year ago on the promise that dismantling the farmers co-operative would produce better financial results for farmers including areturn to a milk price of a kilogram . <p> The revised forecasts of a profit of between and million were well below the profit forecast in the company 's product disclosure statement released ahead of its July 2015 float of over million . <p> It all started to come unstuck for Murray Goulburn a few months ago . In February , Murray Goulburn lowered its forecast profit to million on the back of weak dairy commodity prices . <p> Only weeks ahead of its swingeing late April downgrade , the company had soothed investors that changing regulations in China would not have a material impact on Murray Goulburn 's business . <p> Murray Goulburn 's shares dived from to , a drop of more than 40 per cent after announcing the downgrade . Its shares were languishing at after market close on Monday next to a float price of last May . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the May 2015 float of the dairy farmer co-operative are able to participate in the claim . Other investors who bought into the stock between July 2015 and February 29 , 2016 the day of Murray Goulburn 's first profit revision and still held those units at the start of trading on April 27 , can participate in the class action . <h> Energy Reporter <p> 
 from our policy makers <p> BRIDGING THE GAP : Academics at La Trobe University are working collaboratively on cancer statistics , regional cancer services and how best to measure health inequalities . <p> Recent reports indicate that economic inequality is rising in Bendigo . <p> People are concerned about worsening regional access to jobs and services and increasing income inequality , which is reported in Australia . These matters are obviously an area of concern for us . <p> Whether inequality is , as some believe , the price paid for a flexible economy , or whether it is inexcusable unfairness fraying the fabric of social capital , the contention needs to be investigated . <p> Such concerns also lead to asking , ' What should we expect both for , and from , our policy-makers ? ' For our policy-makers , we should expect that their processes are suitably informed . <p> Economic tools support policy discussion and bring policy issues into the dimension of reality . <p> Our policy-makers should expect to be provided with research findings that have incorporated economics . <p> It is concerning how often policy-makers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply unacceptable . <p> From our policy-makers , we can expect an awareness of cutting-edge research emphases . For instance , although debate about economic inequality is mostly framed around income inequality , economists say individual utility is mostly derived from consumption of goods and services , including leisure . <p> Therefore , widening our gaze to include both consumption inequality and inequality over leisure time is vital and often people in regional areas already mention the inequalities they face in accessing health and education services . <p> Regional people should require from our policy-makers improved approaches to measuring such consumption inequalities . <p> Measurement matters . For example , economists continue to emphasise the limitations of GDP as a measure of economic welfare . <p> GDP does not account for the value to prosperity of home duties such as child-care or unpaid-for work . An economic approach to incorporating length of life into GDP is warranted also . Research on such limitations should matter to our policy-makers . <p> Inequality measurement matters . Economists and mathematicians have worked on inequality measurement for over a century . <p> Measurement can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefiting from the epic advances to length of life we have seen emerge in medicine some die an early death . <p> Little is known about how to measure health inequalities appropriately . There is an age distribution around mortality , and a regional distribution . Mortality inequality warrants attention . <p> Locally , there are some academics at La Trobe University working collaboratively on cancer statistics , regional cancer services and how best to measure health inequalities . <p> We develop sound concepts and correct measurement . Our work contributes to ensuring government policies are made in the context of a careful consideration of the statistics and inequalities affecting society . <p> Note : It would seem very wise to spare a thought for the source of the wealth and health of nations . The Nobel prize-winning economist , Angus Deaton , has a recent book about an historic break-out from poverty . The Great Escape : Health , Wealth , and the Origins of Inequality also examines the prospects for those left behind . @ @ @ backlash pushes

 safety statistics <p> We 're embarking on the single most ambitious road safety strategy in Victoria 's history . It 's a billion plan that sets it sights firmly on one of the biggest killers in our state : country roads . <p> PROACTIVE : The state government is launching a billion campaign to address road safety issues , particularly on country roads . <p> From seatbelts to car safety to booze buses , Victoria has always led the world in road safety . But here 's the bad news : The incredible results we 've achieved over the last few decades have started to plateau . In fact , as it stands , we 're going backwards . <p> It pains me to say that 2015 was the second year in a row where road fatalities actually increased - 252 men , women and children were killed on Victorian roads that year . Another 5000 were injured . The financial cost was around billion . The personal cost we ca n't even begin to calculate . <p> Every two hours , someone is killed or hospitalised after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every two hours , somewhere in this state , there 's a ring of the phone or a knock at the door that bears the sort of news we all spend our lives dreading . Every two hours , someone 's life is changed . <p> This has got to stop . We need to start doing things differently . We need a far more aggressive approach to save Victorian lives . That 's why we 're embarking on the single most ambitious road safety strategy in Victoria 's history . It 's a billion plan that sets it sights firmly on one of the biggest killers in our state : country roads . <p> Half of all road deaths occur in regional Victoria . You are four times more likely to die on a road in the country than a road in Melbourne . If you think about it , it makes sense : higher than average speed limits leave no room for error , longer than average trips mean fatigue is always a factor , and poor lighting , marking and edging only add to the danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're investing million to upgrade 2500 kilometres of country roads installing state-of-the-art safety features like wire rope barriers , and ' rubber strips ' along the centre and the edges of the road . <p> No longer will our approach be limited to just fixing and marking the ' black spots ' the nightmare bends and intersections in the country where many crashes occur . Now , we 're focused on getting ahead of the crashes before they occur . <p> There is no road , no bend and no intersection that we will automatically consider ' safe ' . Everything is under the microscope . And it 's not just about the high-speed roads . Pedestrians make up a huge share of road fatalities . These tragedies are just as likely to happen down at the local shops as anywhere else . <p> As part of our landmark plan , we 'll build more roundabouts and make local paths and roads even safer for pedestrians and for cyclists , too . And we 'll crack down on the offenders who put as all at risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under our new plan , if you 're over the limit even once , even " just by a little bit " , you will get an alcohol interlock device fitted on your car because you put lives in danger . We 're providing 10 new booze buses and expanding roadside drug testing to 100,000 tests a year . And we 'll also trial a brilliant new idea : ' alco gates ' that wo n't let you out of the carpark of a licensed venue if you 're over the limit . <p> Our plan is also about developing new technology to make cars and driving safer , and helping more young people learn about the dangers of being a bloody idiot behind the wheel as it if was n't obvious enough already . <p> We have a goal , here . We want to reduce the road toll to under 200 by the year 2020 . And make no mistake : we 're going to be aggressive about it . We will do whatever it takes to save families the pain of losing someone they love @@@8886685 <h> Tough Task for 
 complete shambles ' <p> An Eaglehawk civil engineer has slammed the council 's oversight of road works in Sailors Gully Road as " not good enough " and a " shambles " , with action only being taken to address safety issues after he contacted WorkSafe . <p> Geordie Mckinlay has 20 years experience as an engineer and site manager and is a parent of a student at Eaglehawk North Primary School , which has been impacted by the works . <p> Mr Mckinlay said he wrote to the City of Greater Bendigo more than two weeks ago alerting them to safety issues , including children playing on heavy machinery , but received no response . <p> He said he then contacted WorkSafe , after which things improved , but the situation remained " a complete shambles " . <p> " I think when you 've got 300 children trying to get to school with probably a similar number of cars as that coming along , not only do you need to provide a safe workplace , but you need to give consideration to traffic and pedestrian flow , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling people to go somewhere else , it just does n't cut it . " <p> Mr Mckinlay said it was not good enough for the council to wait to be approached by the school or members of the public before taking action . <p> " You can not delegate your responsibility for safety to the public , it 's the council 's contractor , it 's the council 's duty of care , " he said . <p> " If the public has to say to the council ' there are safety problems ' , then the council 's not paying attention to how the contractor 's doing the work , or if they are paying attention they lack the experience to make the necessary judgements about what is safe and what is not . <p> " We always apply the Coroner 's Court test What would happen if a child died ? What happens if a child is sick and an ambulance ca n't get to the school ? <p> " There are plenty of things that can go wrong which the contractor should make allowances for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space manager Brett Martini confirmed the council had received Mr Mckinlay 's email and not responded , " but we did take on board his comments " . <p> " We do n't agree with many of the concerns that he 's raised and WorkSafe , following their site visit , have n't raised any further action required for either us or the contractor , " he said . <p> Mr Martini said a council project manager paid regular visits to the site and was also assisting with traffic management . <p> " The contractors have provided stop/go flag men , traffic controllers , to assist with the parents in the pick up and drop off , managing traffic around the school during those periods , " he said . <p> " Every school has challenges around pick up and drop off times and the works are exacerbating that a little but we believe there are measures in place to address that during the construction period .

 a huge impression on and off the court since arriving in Bendigo three months ago . <p> The shooting guard is one of the best imports in the SEABL and has already been chased heavily by NBL clubs . <p> However , if Kendle 's high school varsity coach had his way , the sweet shooting guard would have been lost to basketball . <p> " My sophomore year at high school I was probably five-foot seven inches tall and 140 pounds . I looked like a 12-year-old , ' ' Kendle said . <p> " There were probably kids in band and on the chess team that were better athletes than me . Physically , I was behind the other kids . <p> " The head coach on the senior varsity team wanted to cut me , but the junior varsity coach knew my Dad and they had a mutual respect . He kept me on the team and I rode the bench for the whole season . <p> " The next year I hit a six-inch growth spurt , I worked really hard physically and everything came together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd been told I 'd never play varsity basketball . " <p> Kendle 's high school career led to the opportunity to play at Olney Central Community College . <p> His basketball world came crashing down when he broke the navicular bone in his left foot . Multiple surgeries and complications saw him play just two games in three years at Olney Central . <p> " After my left foot healed I went back to junior college and the first day of practice I broke my right foot , ' ' Kendle said . <p> " After three months out I came back and I broke my right foot again in two different places . " <p> A less driven athlete would have pulled the pin on his basketball career . Kendle had other ideas . <p> " I completely changed my diet , went through a vigorous therapy program and worked really hard , ' ' he said . <p> " I came back again and that 's when I was given the chance to go try-out at Bellarmine University . I was meant to be a walk-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school of Bellarmine . <p> " I played well in the trial at Bellarmine and a few days later I was given a full scholarship . It 's crazy how things work out . " <p> Bellarmine was only a 20 minute drive from his family home which allowed him to spend time with his i 'll mother and gave his family the chance to watch him regularly . <p> Through all the ups and downs of his high school and college career , Kendle 's belief in himself never wavered and he found an outlet that he previously never imagined possible -- religion . <p> " I did n't grow up in church or with a religious background , ' ' Kendle said . <p> " My parents did n't say grace before meals . I love them to death , I could n't ask for better parents , but growing up I did n't have a relationship with God . <p> " The pain and suffering through my injuries led me to search for what was out there . <p> " I began to read the bible and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . <p> " Culmination of everything got me to the point where I am now . My faith is what sustains me . <p> " I 'm human and I make mistakes all the time , but I know that Jesus paid the ultimate price for my sins and mistakes . <p> " Ultimately , that 's where my identity is . People try to identify me as a basketballer , but basketball is not going to last forever . I 'd like to hope that through basketball I can share something that 's going to last forever . " <p> Kendle played three seasons at Bellarmine , became the only player in school history to be named an All-American at NCAA Division II level two years in a row and helped the Knights to win their first national championship . <p> He 's spent the past four years playing basketball professionally in Morocco , Switzerland and Australia . <p> While he still has dreams of playing in the NBA , Kendle wo n't judge his life on what he achieves on the court . <p> " People define @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you make or what car you drive or how popular you are , ' ' he said . <p> " I do n't define success that way . I look at success as what are you doing with the gifts and talents you 've been blessed with ? How hard are you working ? Ultimately , how much are you making the people around you better ? " <p> Right now , Kendle is making the Bendigo Braves better . <p> They 're on top of the SEABL east conference ladder with a 7-2 record . <p> This weekend the Braves play the Melbourne Tigers in Melbourne on Saturday night before facing the Dandenong Rangers on Sunday at Bendigo Stadium at 2pm. <h> Traces Of Ancient

 hearing a lot more about it 's one of the hot trends in holidaying right now . The thinking goes : why travel to the other side of the world , just to lie on a beach or get drunk in a bar ? Why not learn something , absorb the real city , get to know the design and the architecture and by association , the people and culture . <p> Many of us live in homes needing renovation or a complete transformation . And in a young multicultural country like Australia , you can approach your DIY design project free of past cultural convention . So we travel in search of design inspiration in countries that have been perfecting their craftsmanship for centuries . Along the way we soak up the music , food , the dance , the history and the entire flavour that goes with it ! <p> It 's how I holiday and it adds to the experience just so much . <p> The first thing I do when I hit a new city is explore the buildings ( yes , even before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rio went down . <p> Although I love to surf , like many others I have swapped my surfboard for a camera to search for a very different wave : design .

Many may ask : what can a famous beach city Like Rio de Janeiro offer in terms of design ?

The Pritzker Prizewinning architect left his colossal concrete works of architectural art all over the city 600 projects spanning 78 years -- and scratching the surface of it all is a joy . With so many works , a walking tour of his works is recommended . The most famous of all would be the Niteroi Contemporary Art Museum perched on the side of a cliff like a giant red and white spaceship . Niemeyer was a man with no fear of breaking convention as the nature of this proud work boldly shows . ( Bonus tip : a beautiful restaurant waits for you below . ) Also check out the Ministry of Education building he helped design as a young pup and the beautiful Oscar Niemeyer Popular Theatre . <p> The latest piece of architecture to hit Rio in time for the 2016 Olympics is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of my favorites : Spanish Architect Santiago Calatrava . Onlookers ca n't get enough of this brilliant white spine-clad , solar-powered piece of genius that looks like a giant tech cantilevered at least 400 meters over the forecourt of Rio 's downtown port area . Could this be Rio 's answer to the Sydney Opera House ? It only gets better inside , with a series of interactive installations that educate and inspire us all on the subject of our planet 's future . Kids love it : I befriended a group of local boys who 've been four times . This is what I call successful architecture for our new generation , with all the right messaging . <p> Then take a quick stop at the Museo De Arte Do Rio next door , for a bite of historic art , some sharp contemporary pieces and an excellent rooftop restaurant with a view . <p> For a more authentic dining experience , on a tip from the locals , I hit the " Bohemian beers " at the incredible three-level bar/restaurant Rio Scenarium , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined together , filled with more than 10 , 000 antiques , Brazilian gold , mind-blowing live local jazz and couples dancing their cheeks off in a restaurant that makes me feel like I 've been transported back in time . If you hit Rio you must do this place ( but book early on ) . I down a delicious cut steak with green rice and " batatas " and build up the courage to hit the floor with ladies old enough to be my mother . <p> Another great find is a Bossa Nova Bar in Ipanema called Vinicius Show Bar on Rua Vinicius de Moraes . <h> Design <p> I reckon that antiquing in the city you are visiting helps you discover its soul . The generations of the past that have made these decorative choices in their private homes can tell you so much about the people . It 's the pieces that are still here long after they are gone . <p> The Associa ? ? o Brasileira area in Copacabana is the place to go . It 's a little overpriced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives me a taste of the people in this colourful city . Such as the longtime local restoring a centuries-old shrine , who is kind enough to let me into his workshop to photograph his handiwork . <p> Brazilian furniture and design is huge right now so I 'm keen to explore the furniture and d ? cor hot spots around Iponema . I fall in love with Novo Ambiente , four levels of Brazilian gems in a very chic store . You can feel a deep connection to nature with these sophisticated furnishings : the way they embrace relaxation through the subtle reclines in the chairs is a Brazilian fingerprint . <p> There 's a troupe of young up-and-coming designers of today producing beautiful work : Bernardo Figueiredo was a name I kept seeing ; his pieces were a stunning combination of old and new . The " Poltrona Bag " by young Bruno was my standout furniture piece . Best of all , prices were reasonable ! <p> Iron ore has

 support package <p> Federal Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce has announced a package of support measures to support dairy farmers hit by late season price cuts . <p> Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce . <p> THE Coalition will seek to implement a transparent milk price index if re-elected , to avoid a repeat of the dairy industry viability crisis caused by late season retrospective price cuts from Murray Goulburn and Fonterra . <p> Federal Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce today announced million will be allocated to establish a commodity milk price index , in a package of support measures to support impacted dairy farmers . <p> Redirection of two Department of Human Services Mobile Service Centres to dairy regions <p> The assistance package was fine-tuned when Mr Joyce visited north-east Victoria last week and other regions holding meetings with dairy farmers and industry representatives to gauge their concerns . <p> Calls from Australian Dairy Farmers to adjust the eligibility criteria to access in cash grants - that are normally delivered for communities hit by natural disasters like floods and fires - was not successful . <p> Mr Joyce said a re-elected Coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodity milk price index , to help ensure the domestic dairy industry did not find itself in a tough situation again , where dairy processors unexpectedly reduced farm gate milk prices late in the season . <p> He said the pricing index would introduce greater transparency and market signals for domestic and global milk prices . <p> " The Coalition will consult with the industry on the design of the index that would provide dairy farmers with valuable information for use in supply negotiations with processors and to assist in following international price trends , " he said . <p> Mr Joyce said the Coalition was also making immediately available in Dairy Recovery Concessional Loans for Murray-Goulburn and Fonterra suppliers this year and access to in concessional loans over 2016-17 and 2017-18 . <p> He said the 10-year concessional loans would be funded by expanding the drought concessional loan scheme to include dairy-specific criteria . <p> Mr Joyce said the Coalition was allocating to the Rural Financial Counselling Services in dairy production areas to ensure farmers received the farm business financial advice needed . <p> He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out one-to-one business advisory support via the Tactics for Tight Times program . <p> Human Services Minister Alan Tudge said the Coalition was taking immediate action to ensure eligible dairy farmers had fast-tracked access to the support they needed to get through the tough times . <p> " We 've ramped up the number of staff processing Farm Household Allowance claims , " he said . <p> " An extra 18 people have been brought in to process claims and to work directly with farming families on their individual cases , with a special focus on people in financial hardship . <p> " Where a farmer is facing real hardship and we have received the full details , a decision can be made almost immediately . <p> " If there is any difficulty obtaining the information we need to assess a claim , Farm Household Case Officers can talk to the farmer 's accountant or financial adviser to help get the information needed . " <p> Mr Tudge said the Coalition would also appoint a dedicated Dairy Industry Liaison Officer to work on the ground with dairy farmers and local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage any farmer with questions to contact the Farmer Assistance Hotline on 132 316 , which is running on extended hours from 8am to 8pm each day , " Mr Tudge said . <p> Mr Joyce said the Coalition was delivering assistance measures now as an immediate response under the Caretaker Conventions and not waiting until after the July 2 election . <p> " In a sign of our strong confidence in the future of the Australian dairy industry , a re-elected Coalition Government will commit million to build the upgrade of the Macalister Irrigation System in Gippsland , " he said . <p> " The Macalister project will upgrade the 1920s and 1950s era area irrigation network delivering almost 10 gigalitres in water savings which can be put back into growing the region 's agricultural production . <p> " The Coalition values the contribution our dairy farmers make to their regional communities and the nation as a whole and we are proud to support them throughout good times and bad , " he said . <p> Mr Joyce said the concessional loans of or half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what dairy farmers had asked the government for and would help them get through the crisis that had hit the southern part of Australia . <p> He said to qualify for the concessional loans , the government would initially be looking at people who were dealing with Murray Goulburn and Fonterra because they 're at the " crisis centre " . <p> They will have to prove to the government that they 've been affected by the downturn in prices , he said . <p> " That wo n't be very hard because some people have gone from about 42 cents a litre for milk down to 14c and for me that 's a crisis , " he said . <p> Shadow Agriculture Minister Joel Fitzgibbon said he 'd assured Mr Joyce his party would " do nothing to delay any action from the government " but had little expectation on the outcome of the Coalition 's dairy support package . <p> " I 'm obviously still working on Labor 's own package - Bill Shorten and I will have some more to say about that over the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Framed as yet 
 who has had 18 complaints made against him puts him in the top one per cent of most complained about male officers in the Victoria Police force . <p> Complaints made against Sergeant Christopher Taylor have been revealed during an investigation into police misconduct to be more than five times the average of male Victorian police officers . <p> The allegations emerged during the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission examinations in Ballarat on Wednesday with CCTV footage showing the sergeant involved in a number of aggressive incidents with women . <p> After watching the footage played during the hearings he conceded it " did n't look good " . <p> The footage showed Sergeant Taylor putting two separate women , known as Persons C and D , in chokeholds on April 25 , 2009 . <p> " I know it does n't look good , but there is obviously more to it than I can remember , " he told the hearing . <p> Sergeant Taylor went on to tell the inquiry incidents could escalate quickly and get " out of control " . <p> VIEW THE CCTV FOOTAGE HERE <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inquire about her son who had been arrested , before forcibly being removed by the sergeant , who told the hearing she had become " aggressive and fired up " . <p> The same footage shows a second woman , Person D , being brought back into the station in a chokehold only seconds later . <p> The hearing heard another three complaints had been filed against Sergeant Taylor since 2010 , including an alleged assault on October 7 , 2011 , failure to take appropriate action on September 31 , 2013 and allegations of improper aggressive behaviour on October 4 , 2013 . <p> Complaints against Sergeant Taylor 5.28 times the average of a male police officer , placing him in top of male officers <p> Sergeant Taylor told the inquiry no charges had been laid against him , but he was made to complete a disciplinary course . <p> Earlier in the examinations on Wednesday , more video footage showed Sergeant Taylor and a constable pulling on the arms of , and carrying a woman , who had attended the Ballarat Police Station to complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A woman who 
 for assaults on partner <p> A MAN who assaulted his partner multiple times and threw hot coffee on his mother had his jail term reduced by three months on Wednesday . <p> The man in his 30s , who can not be named for legal reasons , appealed his eight-month prison sentence in the Bendigo County Court . <p> The man 's partner supported him in court , with defence counsel Julien Lowy saying the family had " fallen apart " financially since the man was taken into custody . <p> The man was guilty of assault by kicking , two counts of unlawful assault and persistent breaches of family violence intervention orders . <p> Crown prosecutor David Cordy said the first incident occurred in early December when the man kicked his partner while she put away groceries . <p> A family violence intervention order was taken out , but the man returned to the house three weeks later and was verbally abusive , hiding his partner 's phones so she could not call for help . <p> The court heard his partner suffered a stress related health issue that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of their children when police arrived . Another intervention order was taken out in January . <p> The family then went on a holiday together with the man 's mother . <p> He became verbally abusive again , and pushed his mother into a wall . He then kicked her in the stomach when she followed him out of the house . <p> The man grabbed a hot coffee and threw it on his mother , and violently threw his partner back into the house . <p> He was initially sentenced in the Bendigo Magistrates ' Court to eight months jail , to be followed by a 12-month community corrections order and 250 hours of community work . <p> Mr Lowy argued the jail term was counter-productive , and the man 's offending had occurred after he stopped taking his anti-depressant medication . <p> " The victim is in court supported him . She says he gets ' hotheaded when he 's coming off his anti-depressants ' , " he said . <p> " The longer he is in custody , the more difficult it becomes for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unacceptable . <p> " It 's a difficult situation when the victim refuses to make a statement in relation to both incidents , " he said . <p> " Not only do offenders need to understand that people can not behave in this way , so do those who suffer in their hands . " <p> Judge Paul Lacava said he understood the family was in a " perilous " financial situation , and it created a problem in sentencing . <p> " The consequence is regrettable , but it invites a paradox where the court is asked to release an offender to go back to live with the victim , " he said . <p> " When considering additions to a term of imprisonment to be served , a community corrections order can also provide an additional punitive component with a requirement to partake in community work for 250 hours . " <p> The man 's jail sentenced was reduced to five months . He will also complete the community corrections order and unpaid community work . @ @ End of the

 over five days in the Lamington National Park has sparked a police investigation after doubts have been raised over the missing man 's story . <p> 58-year-old Brian Saunders of Tanah Merah on Brisbane 's south told police he went into the park for a walk on Saturday morning carrying light clothing , three sandwiches , 1.8 litres of water and a packet of sultanas . <p> He phoned police at 7pm that night saying he had become lost . He was asked to remain where he was but when rescue crews arrived at the location he could n't be found . <p> On Thursday Mr Saunders emerged from the bush relatively unscathed despite his ordeal , claiming to have survived on a ration of eight sultanas a day since Sunday . <p> Mr Saunders was debriefed by police at the scene and later faced questioning by the Criminal Investigation Bureau at Logan Police Station . <p> Superintendent Ben of Logan Police said it was important for police to be clear about Mr Saunders ' version of events after significant resources were deployed to find him . <p> " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding Mr Saunders being lost in the bush , " he said . <p> " As you would appreciate , significant resources have gone into the search for Mr Saunders and we are really obliged to determine the veracity of the claims he has made .

It 's a unique situation to be in . They say that every boy dreams of kicking a goal after the siren , but when the situation arises I do n't know how many people really want that pressure on them , ' ' Kyneton coach Luke Beattie said . <p> " There was about 10 Sandhurst players on the mark and he had to kick from just inside 50 .

" <p> The scenes at the Kyneton Showgrounds after the final siren were reminiscent of the mid-1990s when the Tigers were a power of the BFNL . <p> Beattie said the Tigers need to compete with , and beat , the top teams regularly to build on the momentum the club has created . <p> " Since coming out of recess we 've been continuing to build the club and make it a place for all our community to feel proud about , ' ' Beattie said . <p> " ( Re-creating the club 's fortunes of the 1990s ) will be born out of not just one week , but multiple weeks of effort .

 claim the state government was deliberately misleading during its recent decision to approve the transfer of several mining licenses . <p> Woodvale Progress Association president Brendan Bartlett provided documents of approval to the Bendigo Advertiser which bear the signature of the then-minister for energy and resources , Lily D'Ambrosio , dated April 7 this year . <p> Two weeks later Mr Bartlett received an email from the Earth Resources regulatory compliance director which said that no decision had been made on the transfer of the licences from Unity Mining to GBM . <p> On April 26 , a spokesperson for the Minister D'Ambrosio repeated that statement to the Advertiser . <p> " The proposed transfer of the licence to GBM Gold is still being considered and no decision has been made as yet , " the spokesperson said . <p> Mr Bartlett said he believed the community was deliberately left in the dark while the transfer occurred " behind closed doors " . <p> " We 've been deceived , " he said .

" <p> As a condition of this month 's licence transfer , GBM was required to rehabilitate the two largest ponds at the Woodvale site within two years and can only send treated water to the site and for use in dust suppression . <p> But Mr Bartlett had been advocating for the Woodvale evaporation ponds to be " forcibly removed " from the rest of the mining transfer so that Unity retained the responsibility to rehabilitate the land . <p> He did so based on transcripts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief executive officer John Harrison is recorded as saying he had no interest in taking over the Woodvale site . <p> " So it was a real kick in the guts when this approval was announced ... and worse when we realised it had been approved all along , " he said .@@9097777 <h> JUST IN <h> 
 " suck it up " culture has created a widespread mental health crisis within the force , a damning report has found . <p> Hundreds of officers are on leave for psychological issues and three have died by suicide since October . <p> The report finds a macho culture inside the force is doing more mental health damage to some officers than the traumatic events they attend . <p> It was a constant theme from some of the 450 officers who participated in the review . <p> " Give me a dead body to look at over a poor manager to deal with anytime , " one leading senior constable wrote . <p> Another officer spoke about hearing two police talking to each other and providing informal support after the suicide of a colleague two days earlier . <p> " A sergeant walked by , paused and said to them , ' Do you want to be f---ing social workers or police officers ? ' " the officer wrote . <p> A sergeant told the review his first ever job concerned the death of a child . <p> " My sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that I needed to suck it up , " he said . <p> The Victoria Police Mental Health Review has made 39 recommendations , all of which Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton has promised to implement to tackle the crisis . <p> Former police officer Ron Fenton , who was shot in the head in 1984 , hopes the mental health review will improve officers ' prospects . Photo : Jason South <p> The recommendations include wide-ranging educational and resilience programs that start the day police join and the establishment of a Department of Veteran organisation for former police . <p> The review says an expanded psychology unit is urgently needed , as well as a dedicated psychology support unit for detectives investigating sexual offences against children . <p> Released on Tuesday , the review was commissioned by Mr Ashton last October following the suicide of a policewoman at her work in Seaford . <p> Since then , another two officers had taken their own lives . Since the year 2000 , 23 officers have done so . There are currently more than 200 police off work with mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many former officers are mentally unwell or have killed themselves . <p> The 90-page report , resulting from a review led by psychologist Dr Peter Cotton , is littered with harrowing remarks about the impact of policing on mental health . <p> Mr Ashton said it left no doubt there was work to do . <p> " As an organisation we must fundamentally change the way we view mental health , " he said . <p> " We need to build a culture that better understands mental health . A culture in which our employees feel safe to ask for help without fear of judgment or prejudice . " <p> It is the second call for a mammoth cultural shift in the force within six months . A Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commission report found last year that the force was riddled with unreported sexual discrimination and harassment . <p> Commander Shane Cole , the head of the force 's health and safety division , said Victoria Police had always been good at looking after people with physical injuries . <p> Since the year 2000 , 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ascui <p> " It 's the mental health that we 've really struggled with as an organisation , and the review certainly found that 's the case , " Mr Cole said . <p> " The surprise in this is why perhaps organisations like ours had n't got to this point earlier . " <p> Ron Fenton is a former police officer who was shot in the head in the Melbourne suburb of Beaumaris in 1984 . His police car was riddled with 27 bullets after intercepting a gunman who had murdered a security guard in Clayton . <p> He wound up with 37 bullet fragments lodged in his head , but the mental scars were worse . <p> " The only psych treatment I got in the police force was one or two sessions with the then police psychologist . That was their entire psychological treatment of me . That was it , " Mr Fenton said . <p> There were more scars to come . He remembers swimming through a child 's body during a search and rescue job . Because of the length of time the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mr Fenton pushed it to shore . <p> " The human psyche is not equipped or trained or built for what we see , " he said . <p> Illustration : Ron Tandberg <p> Mr Fenton welcomed the review and hoped it would lead to more change in the " old culture of take a dose of concrete and harden up " . <p> " I hate the concept of members ending up in the mess I am in and the mess that so many of my associates are ... When you 're devalued it creates more trauma than anything else , and you do get devalued when you get injured , " he said . <p> Dr Cotton said the key challenge for the force was getting officers to seek help early . <p> " What we found is people sit on their hands and do n't recognise the problem they may have is a genuine health condition that they can get help for , " he said . <p> " And when members do recognise they have a challenge , they are reluctant to report for fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's historically been the case . " <p> Other recommendations in the report include the introduction of a case manager for police officers who seek help and allowing former police to access the same services that serving members get . <p> The review has also suggested better records of former officers are kept and a study to gain accurate data on organisational mental health and suicide risk . <p> A new intranet system that family and partners can access has also been recommended , as well as introducing key performance indicators for middle managers to help them better identify and support officers . <p> Lifeline 131 114 <p> beyondblue 1300 224 636 <p> 1300 651 251 <p> Police officers - current and former - and their families can call Welfare Services confidentially on ( 03 ) 9247 3344. <h> RUSH HOUR : 
 1993 when St Kilda footballer Nicky Winmar stood before opposition fans , lifted his jumper , pointed to his skin and declared ' ' I 'm black - and I 'm proud to be black ! ' ' marked a seismic shift in race relations in Australia . <p> Preceding Winmar 's defiant stance not for the first time in his decorated career was a 120-minute barrage of vile and vicious racial abuse . <p> The mercurial midfielder had every right to walk off the field after his best-on-ground performance that day and never return to the game . Instead , his dignified protest became inextricably linked with the reconciliation movement that was to follow . <p> Academics in the 2015 paper " Aboriginal Rules : The Black History of Australian Football " , describe Winmar 's stance as " the Australian equivalent to the Tommie Smith/John Power moment " at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics . <p> Such was its impact , they say it " transcended the realm of sport and football . It was socially , culturally , and politically important as it tapped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and national identity that needed to be had " . <p> While Winmar 's brave act of defiance will forever be linked to reconciliation , Australian Rules Football has also played a leading role since that day . <p> For many Australians , the majority of their exposure to Indigenous culture comes from following the AFL . Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders make up about 3 per cent of Australia 's population , yet about 10 per cent of AFL-listed players are indigenous . <p> That level of representation is found in few other areas of Australian life . Not in federal parliament , not in business , not on our TV screens . <p> The benefits of seeing and hearing these players week in , week out on TV , radio and in newspapers can not be underestimated . <p> The AFL community is a broad church and , as we witnessed so regrettably last year through the booing of Adam Goodes , there are some in society yet to be , or who refuse to be , educated . <p> But that grossly unedifying chapter alone does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as a result more widely in society . <p> The reconciliation process is slow -- far too slow but our indigenous game has a vitally important part to play in improving our understanding of Indigenous culture . <h> Apple might finally 
 cap on live cattle exports have been louder than ever in 2016 against a backdrop of tight cattle supply fuelling cutbacks across Australia 's meat processing sector . <p> are marking the five-year anniversary of the monumental suspension of trade with Indonesia by claiming the trade jeopardises jobs in Australia . <p> They argue that as the national herd sits at its lowest point in 23 years , the volume of live exports steadily increases , putting pressure on the number of cattle available to the local processing sector . <p> " For every additional head of cattle loaded onto ships bound for foreign markets more local jobs are lost , " said Grant Courtney , Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union . <p> questioned whether the federal government had ' fallen to the narrow interests of an industry that contributes nothing to the broader community ' . <p> Whether driven by the desire to protect jobs on home ground or by animal welfare concerns , arguments have been continually made since 2011 for a ban or cap on live trade . <p> " Globally the trade in live animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations become specialised in livestock production systems and integrated into multinational supply chains , " he said . <p> " For Australia to abandon live exports would simply hand major markets over to competitors , none of which have anywhere near equivalent animal welfare standards or programs . " <p> In fact , that has already happened with Australia 's reduced sheep exports . It would happen very quickly for live cattle exports if Australia closed down , Mr Keogh believes . <p> He points out that live exports are a very useful ' market development ' tool that creates an entree to the processed meat market over time - witness the growth of Australian sheepmeat exports to the Middle East on the back of involvement in live sheep exports . In 2015 , the value of livestock exports was around billion . <p> He will be

 fight towards equality on our roads <p> THERE is a bitter war playing out every day on Bendigo 's roads , but it is far from a fair fight . <p> On one side are motorists , encased in protective metal shells weighing anywhere from to and capable of reaching legal speeds of up 110km/h . <p> The drivers of these vehicles not only have the advantage of size and speed , but an array of safety measures such as seat belts and airbags . <p> On the other side are cyclists .

Some might call that madness , others progress . <p> Yet it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between these road users . It is , in fact , the respective mentalities of members of the two groups that is the nucleus of this long-running conflict . <p> Many motorists consider cyclists merely slow-moving obstacles who put themselves in harm 's way by choosing to encroach on their domain . <p> Conversely , many cyclists view motorists as arrogant bullies who throw their weight around simply because they can . <p> These adversarial attitudes must be eradicated through a quantum shift in the attitudes of those who share the roads . It is a matter of life and death . <p> Last year 10 cyclists were killed and many more seriously injured on Victoria 's roads . All 10 were male , with an average age of 47 years . <p> Whether you drive a car or ride a bike , you are equally entitled to use our roads , provided you operate your chosen mode of transport within the law . <p> Like it or not , cyclists are only going to become more common on our roads . <p> Governments are investing heavily in bike lanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as reducing congestion and pollution , of people swapping four wheels for two . <p> It is up to all road users to use these facilities with common sense and courtesy . <h> Voters attack former 
 for Woods Bagot fit-out <p> Woods Bagot had been in its Southbank office for 10 years . While the view of the Yarra from the building 's domed ceiling was impressive , the office required updating . <p> " That office was set up in a fairly traditional way , with rows of workstations that were n't designed for an interactive studio environment , " says architect Bruno Mendes , Design Principal of Woods Bagot . " We were also keen to cross the river , back to the CBD , " he adds , recalling a previous location in architect Harry Seidler 's Shell building . <p> However , finding sufficient space for 170 staff on predominantly one level in a CBD location was always going to be challenging . " We were looking for over 2,000 square metres and on one level if possible , " says Mendes , who found an empty tenancy in the brutalist-style building on the corner William and Little Collins streets , originally designed by American architects SOM in the late 1960s . <p> While not the one level as preferred , Woods Bagot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Before preliminary designs were carried out for Woods Bagot 's new office fit-out , feedback from the various staff groups ( such as design and administration staff ) was welcomed . Feedback as to the failings of the previous office was also encouraged . Words generated from these meetings , both positive and negative , included intense , exciting and creative to non-collaborative spaces and insufficient communal areas . So the idea of ' gathering ' was formulated early in the design process , with images of the family meal taken from world-renowned chef 's book The Family Meal . This book shows chefs sitting around a long trestle-style timber table exchanging ideas . " We spend a considerable amount of time at work , so engaging with staff is paramount , " says Mendes . Also on Mendes ' mind was the Greek agora , a theatre-style seating arrangement that brings people together . <p> One of the first changes made to the two floor plates was removing part of the concrete ceiling and linking the two levels ( mezzanine and first floor ) with a timber and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with black steel , this informal seating , complete with staircase or oversized tiers , functions as a presentation area , a place to eat lunch or an informal meeting area . As pivotal in the design was the need to move people away from being fixated to one workstation . As well as a variety of work areas , including high benches dotted around the office , there are quiet pods located behind glass and steel doors . Staff can also move into one of the meeting areas on the mezzanine , beautifully framed by steel-mesh curtains . <p> The other important feature in the design is the four-metre-wide corridor on the first floor that meanders from one side of the floor plate to the other . Featuring benches and loose tables and chairs , this corridor ensures a greater degree of connectivity between staff . Large breakout areas from the corridor ensure this area is constantly activated . <p> Unlike many contemporary offices , where plans and models are fully concealed , the idea for this fit-out was to create a studio environment . As a consequence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's also a separate model-making room to eliminate any noise . " In our previous office , all our information was found only by switching on a computer . Here , it 's about seeing the various stages of each project , keeping them updated and tracking their progress , " says Mendes . <p> And while there 's a hive of activity on both floors , there 's a sense of tranquility and calm in the choice of materials used . Black steel and messmate , combined with concrete , create a perfect backdrop . As with the spaces that ' blur ' into each other , the black steel fuses with the timber in the most unexpected ways . The reception area design , for example , features steel that first appears within the concrete floor .@@9176348 <h> CBI nets 14 
 a walk on the wild side at your peril <p> Most people would never even contemplate deliberately breaking 99 per cent of the laws that are in place to govern our behaviour . <p> But there are some laws those we deem so frivolous as to be almost inconsequential that even the most stand-up citizen breaks on occasion . <p> This week Bendigo police conducted a blitz on a law we have surely all been guilty of flouting before -- jaywalking . <p> Of the 60 infringement notices handed out during a 48-hour period patrolling the Hargreaves Mall , a whopping 55 were for pedestrians failing to obey the traffic lights . <p> The backlash against the police on social media was as swift as it was predictable . <p> " What an absolute joke , " one Facebook user commented . " I 'm sure there were more worthy crimes that could have been prevented instead of just targeting such a non-issue . " <p> At face value , it is hard to argue with this sentiment , which this particular gentleman was certainly not alone in expressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes occurring every day in Bendigo -- thefts , assaults and numerous other offences that carry far heftier penalties . But does that mean the police should turn a blind eye ? <p> Furthermore , is failing to abide by the electronic red and green men that stand guard over our city 's intersection really a crime , or just one of the shortcuts we are all prone to taking in life from time to time ? <p> A valid question , certainly , but perhaps statistics from the Transport Accident Commission can help answer . <p> In 2014 a total of 44 pedestrians were killed on Victoria 's streets , followed by 33 in 2015 . That is 77 people whose lives were suddenly , tragically snuffed out as a result of coming off second best in a collision with a vehicle . <p> Regardless of who was at fault in those incidents , that is 77 people too many and highlights the dangers of being a pedestrian dangers that are undoubtedly magnified when the rules are not followed . <p> So while no one can argue crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else the police operation this week should give us all some food for thought . <p> Yes , is annoying to just miss a green light and have to wait for an " eternity " for the next one to come around , but is it really worth risking your life over ? <h> Global Bioactive Materials

 two top-three BFNL sides at Bendigo Mazda Oval was dominated by the backlines , with Storm co-coach Bryce Curnow and Roos ' key defender Hunter Lloyd outstanding . <p> Barely a kick separated the teams for three quarters before Strathfieldsaye broke the game open with four last-term majors . <p> Storm 's under-18 skipper Matthew Harvey slotted his second goal of the day to get the visitors started as they eventually surged home 8.7 ( 55 ) to Flat 's 5.9 ( 39 ) . <p> There were n't many first half highlights .

 illegally dumping waste <p> EPA fines Donald sewerage company for dumping 400 litres of septic waste on public land . <p> A DONALD company has been fined for illegally dumping 400 litres of septic waste on public land at Lake Wooroonook Reserve . <p> The Environment Protection Authority fined sewerage company Onleys Holdings Pty Ltd for abandoning waste at a site not licensed to receive it . <p> The waste was found to contain high amounts of e-coli , and was dumped on the land because it would not fit in the last load on the company 's truck . <p> A member of the public alerted the EPA to the illegal dumping .

 one mining company from scratch , which was sold five years ago to Rio for billion , personally pocketing more than million in the process . Now he wants to do it all over again . <p> The last time it was coal in Mozambique when Michael O'Keeffe , the former boss of Glencore Australia who cut his teeth working in Mt Isa , built Riversdale Mining from a micro cap into a billion purchase for Rio for at the peak of the coal market . <p> Now , he 's shifted commodities and continents , to iron ore in eastern Canada , where mines are closing amid a pervasive global glut . And along the way , the rusted-on Cowboys NRL supporter has warmed to the local ice hockey . <p> O'Keeffe was parachuted into Mamba Minerals in mid-2013 , a mining tiddler with its foot on some iron ore acreage in eastern Canada . By year 's end , it had merged with a Canadian outfit , Champion Mines , which had promising acreage in the same neighbourhood of northern Quebec and , more recently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he takes advantage of the iron ore downturn to snap up assets ar firesale prices . <p> Cliffs paid billion for Bloom Lake at around the same time as Rio paid top of the market prices for the Mozambique coal project from O'Keeffe 's Riversdale , going on to spend another million on upgrades before it collapsed . <p> In what could prove to be a deal of a lifetime , O'Keeffe paid just million for a project the previous owners had invested more than billion on . But now he faces the hurdle of halving production costs and getting it back up and running , with a target for first shipments by the end of 2017 , if the story is to have a happy ending . <p> " The hard yards is grabbing hold of the project , " O'Keeffe said . " It took two years of circling , trying to line up the opportunity . It was a long journey . " <p> When Cliffs bought Bloom Lake , the price of iron or , it needed a margin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowed to buy the project . <p> " It was never going to work with those sorts of numbers , " O'Keeffe said . <p> Without the heavy debt burden , this gives Champion , along with the Quebec government , which has also taken equity in the project , a leg up , but the hard work has only just begun . Access arrangements to the rail link to get the ore to the port the Gulf of St Lawrence and then loaded onto vessels are yet to be finalised , for example . The government has also bought port facilities there , which should also help with the export logistics . <p> Bloom Lake can never compete with Australia and Brazil , which export hundreds of millions of tonnes of iron ore annually . But its edge is a higher quality product 66 per cent iron compared with 62 per cent or less for Australian iron ore exports coupled with lower impurities such as alumina , which gives it entre to some countries in north Asia such as Japan , Taiwan and Korea , which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron ore . <p> Additionally , Cliffs was achieving recoveries of less than 70 per cent at the processing plant at the Bloom Lake works , rather than the 80 per cent or better sought by O'Keeffe . <p> Reducing mine production costs , much of which rests on lifting the operating rate on the processing plant coupled with changes to the mine plan are central to getting the mine back in operation at a rate where it could be profitable . Under O'Keeffe , Bloom Lake is looking at shipping around 7.5 million tonnes of ore annually . <p> Riversdale was a disastrous deal for Rio Tinto ; it paid billion in 2011 for assets it sold soon after for just million , having having misread the outlook for coking coal , the quality of the resource and the Mozambique government 's willingness to let Rio barge the output down the Zambezi river . <p> For his part , O'Keeffe has blamed Rio for its failure to win government support to barge coal from the mine , with the government there insisting the ore be railed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbour in Quebec . Rio is working in the same area , the Labrador Trough of northern Quebec through Iron Ore Co of Canada , an 18 million tonne a year operation it manages and has a controlling 58.87 per cent stake in . <p> For O'Keeffe , helping him along the way in his switch to iron ore in Canada has been the active involvement of the government . <p> " The catalyst was the government coming in , " O'Keeffe said , at a time when " everyone 's closed the books on iron ore " . <p> The government involvement also helped to encourage two private equity investors -- Wynnchurch and Resource Capital Funds to also commit funds to a recent million placement by Champion to part-fund the Bloom Lake purchase . <p> Cliffs Natural Resources unit Cliffs Quebec Iron Ore , which held Bloom Lake and associated assets , collapsed in mid-2015 due to the units chronic losses , opening the door for O'Keeffe to swoop .@@9319085 <h> Senior Writer <h>

 help solve inequality <p> Imagine if every weekend was a long weekend , and every week a four-day week . It could be the radical solution we need to shift stubborn workplace inequality . <p> It 's not just gender equality to play for . More leisure time can be devoted to volunteering , with associated benefits to self-esteem and wellbeing . <p> In Sweden , a 30-hour week has been shown to benefit satisfaction and health , and lead to a more equal share of housework and childcare between genders . Yet another Swedish experiment found that a decrease in work time by 1 per cent corresponds to an 0.8 per cent reduction in household greenhouse gas emissions . <p> Australian academics have recently called for our current 38-hour cap to be strengthened in order to improve gender equality . Perhaps we should go further : a four-day work week - for both men and women . <p> In her book The Wife Drought , Fairfax Media columnist Annabel Crabb suggested we 've been looking at workplace equality all wrong . It 's not just about getting women into work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's about getting men to go home . <p> Nearly three quarters of Australians aged 25 to 74 are in couple relationships . To understand the imbalance between the two sexes at work , we must look at how these teams of two balance things at home . <p> Of couples with children , the prevailing family structure is loosely traditional : a man working full-time with a partner either working part-time or not at all . About half of all nuclear families look like this . <p> Things look different for mothers working full-time : less than 15 per cent have partners who work part-time or not at all . This may explain some of the difficulty women have reaching the top in demanding professions . <p> Labor leader Bill Shorten was criticised for pointing out that " men in Australia rely on the women in Australia to do the childcare " . But it 's true : women do 64 per cent of the childcare in couple families . Factoring in single parent families , this would be higher . <p> It 's a similar story with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will clock up 42 hours if she is not employed , and 25 hours if she is employed full-time . For men , the figures are 20 and 16 hours respectively . <p> Crabb notes that despite women 's considerable shift into work , " the lack of a corresponding shift the other way by men means that combining work and family , for women , is harder than it should be " . <p> Men find it hard to step back from work , even if they want to : the Diversity Council observed in 2012 that 79 per cent of young fathers would like to try a compressed work week , but only a quarter did . It 's not just fathers . Last year the Australia Institute found that almost half of full-time workers feel overworked and want to work less . <p> Couples have a limited amount of time between them to earn , care , cook and clean .

" <p> Mr Phillips reiterated that there were some professions where women were lagging behind their male colleagues to a larger extent than in the public service . <p> " There are some occupations where men are less well paid than women , but by and large there is a fairly large pay gap of about 19 per cent once you account for hours , " he said . <p> " There are certain occupations where there are massive differences and that 's in finance areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly with medical specialists , that 's when the main pay gaps are .

 party of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art curators , collectors and philanthropists from around the world ( including Klaus Biesenbach from New York 's Museum of Modern Art and Judith Neilson from Sydney 's White Rabbit Gallery ) are gathered in the newly built main entrance hall . Some are making their way up the maple staircases to peruse seven floors of exhibitions . Others are getting a bird 's eye view of the Richard Serra sculpture , Sequence , a giant maze made of weatherproof steel visible from the street . It was considered so integral to SFMOMA that it was placed before the walls that surround it were built . <p> In an expansion that took three years making it the largest museum of modern art in the US the city of San Francisco around SoMa ( South of Market ) neighbourhood has changed with Silicon Valley moving in . Across the road is the new LinkedIn office tower and nearby is Twitter , Pinterest , Yelp and Airbnb . Taking advantage of a new tax break , there 's been a boom with highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively pricing others , including artists , out of the Bay Area . <p> Inside the museum are some of the greatest hits of modern art including a room of Andy Warhol 's ( his Triple Elvis features ) , some Cy Twomblys and Lichtensteins . There 's a room featuring Chuck Close 's large-scale pixelated works . One floor is dedicated to the New Pritzker Center for Photography , where 24 later-period photographs by Diane Arbus are housed as well as local Jim Goldberg 's Rich and Poor series , which looks at the social divide in 1970s and ' 80s America with portraits accompanied by handwritten texts from the subjects . The photographs displayed of the rich are separated from the poor by a hallway of maple . It 's a series that could be revisited today . A couple of streets away from SFMOMA is the Tenderloin district , where homeless survive blocks away from the construction cranes building new pads for the techies . <p> On the free-to-the-public second floor you can view a Matisse , a Klee , a Frida Kahlo and a readymade by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 years old . There are 19 special exhibitions in all , including a curated selection of 260 works from the Doris and Donald Fisher Collection . Founders of The Gap , the Fishers began collecting modern art for the clothing giant 's offices in the mid- ' 70s . <p> Speaking at the opening , son Bob Fisher recounted his parents ' dedication to the premise that " art spurs creativity " . So passionate were the Fishers that one painting they owned , Two Candles by Gerhard Richter , would be wrapped up in a blanket and shipped out of San Francisco in the back of their station wagon to hang in their summer place every year . The photo-realistic painting is on now display on the sixth floor of SFMOMA . <p> The Fishers signed a 100-year partnership with SFMOMA to showcase their collection , which includes not one but four large rooms of Ellsworth Kellys and seven abstract paintings by Agnes Martin housed in a dedicated octagonal chapel-like gallery . <p> Norwegian architecture firm Sn ? hetta which also designed the impressive Norwegian National Opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Hall at the University of South Australia was tasked with integrating the expansion with the original 1995 Mario Botta-designed building . Said to be inspired by the fog coming off San Francisco Bay , the rippled facade of the new building is made of fabricated fibreglass reinforced polymer panels . One critic likened it to a giant meringue . The building squeezes up against the St Regis on one side and is best viewed not from street level but from the sculpture garden , an outdoor restaurant area . <p> There are two restaurants and a cafe on site . The soon-to-open In Situ by Michelin three-starred chef Corey Lee promises to be like a museum of food featuring a changing menu of global dishes from recipes contributed by other Michelin starred chefs including Rene Redzepi and Heston Blumenthal . <p> On a tour of the museum with Craig Dykers , founding partner of Sn ? hetta and leader of the firm 's design team for SFMOMA , he explains the intentional " palette cleansing spaces " throughout the building . There 's a public terrace on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reinvigorated by fresh air , sunlight and vistas of the city between galleries , " he says . You can also sit in the maple-framed bay windows on the gallery landings and enjoy the view . Even the bathrooms provide selfie-worthy sensory relief of sorts , each level from floor to ceiling is painted in a different powerful monocolour . <p> Dykers urges us to eschew the lifts for the light-filled grand maple staircases running near the windows on the eastern side of the building . He leads us up to the top floor where the staircase becomes so narrow you must walk single file . It 's intentional . <p> " When you can rub shoulders with a stranger it makes for a different kind of experience , a civil moment , where you have to say ' after you ' , " says Dykers . <p> The marriage of art , landscape and architecture is most impressive in the Alexander Calder Motion Lab . Calder 's mobiles gently twirl whenever the doors are opened to the adjacent sculpture terrace . On the terrace , the backdrop to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featuring 19,442 plants , of which 40 per cent are native to California . <p> If the design of a museum has to reflect the interests of the people that inhabit the city then SFMOMA has gone out of its way to woo the techies . A common theme across the opening speeches was this is a museum for sharing , smartphone photos and social media sharing is encouraged . <p> Interactivity is paramount to the visiting experience with a new immersive app using indoor positioning technology ( via the museum 's Wi-Fi ) to deliver a variety of themed audio tours . No need to stop and start the app , it can pick up where you are standing and accordingly add commentary . For lighthearted art criticism , Martin Starr and Kumail Nanjiani from the Silicon Valley TV series debate artistic merits of various works in " This Is Not an Artwork Tour " . High-wire walker Philippe Petit and members of the San Francisco Giants also add their commentary to the artworks on display . The app effectively functions as a " fifth wall " for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design on the sixth floor called " Typeface to Interface " curated through posters , analog machines and signs from 1950 to now with Google Glass . Here there 's a drawing machine that chalks a new illustration on a giant blackboard every 30 minutes . <p> What is clear from both the app and a full day 's viewing the new SFMOMA , is that it demands repeat visits . Three days with " palette cleansing breaks " either within the nooks and crannies of the building or across the rest of San Francisco is the perfect amount of time to take in the enormous collection of works . With an hour to spare before the airport I did what SFMOMA hopes local techies may now do on their lunch break by plugging in my earphones , turning on the app and going for a free walk through Richard Serra 's Sequence maze to get lost in art for 20 minutes before stepping back onto the streets of San Francisco . <h> TRIP NOTES <h> MORE INFORMATION <h> GETTING THERE <p> Qantas fly directly to San Francisco from Sydney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> STAYING THERE <p> The InterContinental San Francisco is within 10 minutes walking distance to SFMOMA , as well as the downtown shopping hubs .

 paying tips on cruises <p> " Nickel and diming " is an American phrase that has become common currency and one that many cruisers use to describe ( disparagingly ) the practice of adding more and more extra charges to the basic cruise fare . <p> " We follow many of your tips when cruising . Here 's number 26 . Do n't pay the stateroom ' gratuities ' lumped onto your shipboard account .

 the heart of mental health <p> The question is , how best to set such services up to meet the ever-growing demand for their help . <p> We will be keenly tracking developments in this space throughout the three-year mental health services reform period , ending in 2019 . <p> The federal government has delegated many of the responsibilities to its 31 Primary Health Networks , which are only relatively new themselves . <p> The Murray Primary Health Network , which covers Bendigo , started on July 1 , 2015 . <p> It will assume responsibility for managing five headspace centres on July 1 this year . <p> As part of its role , Murray PHN will create a plan for integrated and accessible mental health services and suicide prevention programs , tailored especially to the region and community . <p> That will determine the future of our headspace centre , beyond the funding promised by the federal government for the next two years . Why ? <p> The National Mental Health Commission 's review of mental health programs and services , released in December 2014 , determined our approach was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned and badly integrated system is a massive drain on peoples ' wellbeing and participation in the community on jobs , on families , and on Australia 's productivity and economic growth , " the review read . <p> " Despite almost $10 billion in Commonwealth spending on mental health every year , there are no agreed or consistent national measures of whether this is leading to effective outcomes or whether people 's lives are being improved . " <p> Headspace in Bendigo has an average of 125 new referrals from people aged 12-25 each month . <p> That 's a significant number of young people accessing the free service . Especially considering recent research , in which headspace was involved , found many are n't seeking help for fear of the stigma attached . <p> Murray PHN chief executive Matt Jones has assured us the focus of long-term planning will be to build on the service . <p> We hope the reforms will further encourage people to seek help , and make it even easier to do so . <p> Headspace Bendigo program 
 manager Jenny Singe reassured young people services were operating as usual and would continue to do so , for at least the next two years . <p> She said there was some uncertainty about what would happen thereafter . <p> Primary Health Networks will assess mental health services in their regions , with the aim of making the system more integrated and accessible in their communities . <p> Murray PHN chief executive Matt Jones said there would be " no changes whatsoever " to headspace services for the next two years . <p> " So no immediate disruption , no short-term changes , " he said . <p> " There will be long-term planning about how to strengthen the service provision . " <p> About 125 new referrals are lodged with headspace Bendigo each month by people aged 12 -- 25 . <p> " They do n't need a referral or parental consent they can just come in and access the service , " Mrs Singe said . <p> " It 's all free , and if we are not the right service for them , we guide and support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have people come from all over the place as far as Echuca , Donald , Kyneton and Kyabram .

 optimism say experts at sheep industry conference <p> POSITIVE : chair Jason Trompf says there is good reason for the sheep industry to be optimistic . Pictures : NONI HYETT <p> There are plenty of reasons for optimism in the sheep meat and wool industries , presenters have said at a conference in Bendigo on Wednesday . <p> More than 300 people attended the conference to hear from 16 individuals and groups on issues affecting the industry and how they could make the most of their business . <p> chair Jason Trompf said there was " significant opportunity " in the sheep industry . <p> He said lamb and mutton prices were high , " in the top 10 per cent for prices historically " , and a lack of supply was also bolstering the wool market . <p> " How effectively and efficiently you capture that opportunity is what this conference is about , " Mr Trompf said . <p> One of the keynote speakers was Rabobank commodity analyst Georgia Twomey , who gave attendees an update on the current state of play , particularly in regards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ms Twomey said the outlook for the industry was " reasonable " , demand was holding up and the depreciation of the Australian dollar had kept local returns strong . <p> But both she and Mr Trompf said despite the positive state of the domestic industry , it was important producers did not rest on their laurels . <p> Ms Twomey said it was an opportune time for producers to think about the future of their business and what they could do to cushion themselves from market volatility . <p> Vicky Geddes , a meat and wool producer from Holbrook in southern New South Wales , also presented at the conference . <p> Mrs Geddes once had cattle and sheep , but with the 2006 drought , decided to replace the cattle with ewes . <p> As someone who had made significant changes to her business , she said she hoped to give others the confidence to make changes and evolve their business . <p> Lubeck producer Graeme Maher attended because as a farmer , he said , learning was critical to ensure he did not go backwards in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry , saying he would not have invested the significant amount of money to enter it several years ago if he did not see a strong future . <p> Mr Trompf said the conference provided not only strategic information but also applied information , which producers could take back and immediately implement in their business . <p> He said the conference differed from many others of its type because it was organised by the production network , which numbers about 3000 members and has 60 producer groups , each headed by a co-ordinator . <p> Mr Trompf said many of these co-ordinators attended the conference and took the information back to their groups , resulting in wider dissemination of the information . <p> The sheep meat and wool industry is Victoria 's third-largest agricultural industry by value . <p> Victoria is Australia 's largest lamb and mutton producing state and is also one of the world 's largest suppliers of sheep meat .@@9490578 <h> Wooden power pole 
 treasures found <p> Historical structures and several artefacts dating back to the gold rush , have been discovered in Long Gully . <p> Two historical structures and several artefacts dating back to the gold rush , have been discovered by contractors carrying out excavation works in Long Gully . <p> Heritage Victoria was called in to investigate when a red brick structure was discovered by Coliban Water contractors in April . <p> Further excavation was authorised , and resulted in the discovery of a timber-lined well , a red-brick cistern used for storing water and several artefact fragments . <p> DISCOVER : Several artefacts dating back to the gold rush were found in Long Gully . PICTURES : Supplied . <p> Coliban Water 's infrastructure delivery manager , Corey Bourne , said contractors were excavating the site near Creeth Street in April for the installation of underground tanks to prevent sewer spillages during heavy rainfall . <p> " As part of the planning process for all our projects we refer to local planning overlays , state and national heritage registers to ensure the preservation of culturally significant locations and artefacts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical importance had been recorded at this site but on the discovery of a red-brick structure , we ceased work and contacted Heritage Victoria to conduct an investigation . <p> " Heritage Victoria authorised further excavation and on completion a timber-lined well , a red-brick cistern used for storing water and several artefact fragments had been unearthed . <p> " It is estimated the well was constructed in the late 1850s , at the peak of the Bendigo Gold Rush , and fell out of use by 1890s . It is a relatively uncommon find , but the four-metre diameter cistern is considered more common . <p> SIGNIFICANT : Heritage Victoria was called in to investigate when a red brick structure was discovered by Coliban Water contractors in April . <p> " Once the site had been photographed and recorded , Heritage Victoria gave us permission to resume work on the project .

 netball team concept a winner <p> EDITORIAL : Netball Victoria 's new League Club Challenge concept shapes as a winner for local premier teams . <p> NETBALL Victoria 's new League Club Challenge an answer to soccer 's Champions League format announced this week shapes as a cracking competition . <p> With it comes the chance for one netball team to officially earn the title as the " best league club " in Victoria and who would n't want that bestowed upon them ? <p> The concept sounds simple enough , with the 42 A-grade netball premiers from across the state this season invited to the State Netball and Hockey Centre in Melbourne on the weekend of March 11-12 next year for a round robin tournament . <p> Locally , that will include the four premier teams from the AFL Central Victoria region the Bendigo , Heathcote District , Loddon Valley and North Central leagues . <p> The prize for winner is the chance to be officially recognised as the No.1 league club in the state and no doubt receive a massive boost to their profile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victoria , which has traditionally based such higher-level competition around leagues , associations and regions . <p> " It 's the first time Netball Victoria has created a competition for clubs to compete at this level , so we hope everyone gets behind it and makes it a great competition , " Netball Victoria said this week . <p> The timing of the new tournament is interesting given it will be played six months after the eligible clubs have won their A-grade netball premierships in September this year . <p> It 's unlikely to be the same premiership squads that take to the court for the Challenge tournament given the annual comings and goings of off-season player movement . <p> For example , take last year 's Loddon Valley A-grade premier Pyramid Hill , which started this season with just one player Gabby Kennedy from its 2015 team that defeated Calivil United in the grand final . <p> Perhaps holding the Challenge on the last weekend of October could have been more appropriate timing for a truer indication of the best of 2016 , with there a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intact and that the season wo n't be a distant memory like it is come March , 2017 . <p> Regardless of any queries over the timing , teams , particularly those currently at the pointy end of the ladder , now have that little bit of extra incentive when they take to the court knowing they not only have an A-grade flag to strive for this year , but there is also the carrot of potential state glory dangling , too .@@9499357 <h> Behind Y&amp;R NZ 
 to crush of everyday life <p> I have some real sympathy for those folk in Kangaroo Flat who do n't want to see a rare little shard of urban bush disappear to home development . <p> I have some real sympathy for those folk in Kangaroo Flat who do n't want to see a rare little shard of urban bush disappear to home development . <p> But I have to warn them that even if they ever get their tiny sliver of happiness declared a bush sanctuary , having it declared a reserve does n't mean it will be preserved . <p> Case in point : a couple of years ago Mrs Whacked and I and the whole weird " pack " of assorted animals moved out from our city centre home to a beaut place just a little further out . Not far and still within a few minutes of the city . <p> One of the influencing factors was that our new place was all-but surrounded by a bushland reserve . How good was that ? Just five minutes from the CBD and you 're almost in the bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that it 's on-going hard work to hang onto our pockets of bush even if they are officially declared free of any further development . <p> Neglect and disregard have nibbled away at it over the past two years . <p> First , there 's a fair few people who think it 's okay to ride their illegal , unmuffled mini-bikes down public roads to access the bush , where they rip , snort and tear around . My new neighbours get as frustrated as we do about that . Apart from the Sunday noise , apart from the public danger , apart from the fact I fear one of them is going to get killed when they spurt across public roads , the damage to the bush is clear . <p> There are now great clearings in the middle of the bush where they like to do circle work . <p> Then there 's the mud-pluggers who like to take their 4WD beasties into the bush immediately after rain .

Or , if they have to , can they please repair the damage ? <p> In one section , a big project nearby has seen dozens of semi-trailers , tankers , graders , trucks and utes parking further and further into the adjacent bush for many months . <p> Meanwhile , about 500 metres away , some other agency has started to excavate an intersection and dozens of huge concrete pipes have been stacked ... yep , at the fringe of the bush and massive diggers have been parked between the trees , surrounded by temporary security pens . <p> The bush had already been nibbled back on this corner by construction crews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sundry other important works . <p> Aerial shots on Google Earth indicate that in some places there are more tracks than trees .

" <p> You were quoted after last week 's 207-point loss to Golden Square the 29th defeat in a row that you believe the club is heading in the right direction . Can you elaborate ? <p> " Every decision we 've made has been for the betterment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid in a key position for too long because we do n't want it to take a toll on him or doubled him up every game of the year because we do n't want it to affect his welfare . <p> " We 're playing a ( Jac Matthews ) with a mature body who we know is going to struggle to win a tap-out for us , but we feel it 's the best thing for us long-term . <p> " Clearly there 's times where we do n't touch the ball out of the centre , but I 'm prepared to wear that and make the call to preserve our young kids . <p> " They are some of the things that people do n't see , and we 're not picking our best team on paper . <p> " We 've picked some players this year who are really struggling players , but they did all the work during the pre-season , so we 're going to pick them because we 've got to build our standards that way . " <p> How far do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As a club we 've really tried to take ownership and it could be a whole range of things . It could be a product of off-field , on-field , our junior structure over the years , but we 've got to wear that . <p> " From my point of view we get a chance to establish where we want to go and get some clear direction . <p> " But I 'm very respectful of the people who have been at the club before me and I do n't think anyone does n't try to do their best . " <p> What do you hope to get out of these next nine games to take into next year ? <p> " We are developing players through analysis , video footage , building their training standards and different aspects of their game . <p> " We are not going to get it all synchronised , because a few guys will have a good game , a few will have a bad game . <p> " But our boys have produced good passages of play . We were three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Saturday . <p> " So all the planning we did , the boys showed they can carry it out , we just ca n't sustain it . <p> " What happens is past demons of a run of 29 losses in a row I 'm sure come into the minds of players when a goal goes against them . <p> " Culturally , that 's one of our biggest challenges , but everything else in the background is moving along well . " <p> Do you have your players turning up on a Saturday believing they can win , or just hoping they wo n't be on the end of another belting ? <p> " We 've genuinely before every game had a belief that we can at least be extremely competitive or win the game . <p> " That 's a great testament to the boys and I do n't expect that to change .

As far as recruiting goes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back some of the many players who have left the club in recent years ? <p> " Absolutely , we really need to value our past junior players at the club because they provide the core and the history and the spiritual alignment . <p> " From a strategic point of view we did n't target anyone from Ballarat this year because there 's the travel component , but in years two and three we want to start to move into that area and have some sustainability . <p> " We do n't want players coming for a couple of years and then in years three and four having to regenerate a new set of players . " <p> There 's now a stigma attached to Maryborough given the club 's poor on-field performance . What impact do you feel that will have on recruiting going into next year ? <p> " To even get to the point where we picked up 20 players this year , it 's about being honest , up front and those guys believing in what we 're trying to do . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide the situation and it 's a credit to the guys who came on board given they were told exactly where it 's at . <p> " We 've got an extremely good group of young players who are well connected , great mates and have good futures at the footy club and that absolutely is a strength of ours going forward . " <p> There 's obviously a myriad of issues the club is battling at the moment , but what would you say is the No.1 hurdle holding Maryborough back ? <p> " There 's no doubt there has been perception and reputation issues around the club . <p> " Certainly our connection to the community and surrounding clubs needs to improve . <p> " I 'm very clear that we are not competing with our district clubs and it 's not us against them . <p> " The district clubs compete against themselves for positional place on the ladder , I believe we need to work with our surrounding district clubs . <p> " If that means we can provide additional resources to help their footy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being an important part of the area going forward is not the way we look at it . " <p> What 's the vision going forward that can see the club again become competitive in the Bendigo league and how long do you believe it will take to turn around ? <p> " I 'm committed for three to four years now , and every decision has been made around that . <p> " What we will be doing is starting the recruiting process , but what we need to do is if our environment is a place where people want to stay and also come to , that will ultimately be what keeps us going forward . <p> " At the moment players are enjoying their footy and developing , so we need to continue to build that , build our professionalism and I 'd suspect people will want to get on board . <p> " I 'm really confident about our future over the next couple of years and beyond . <p> " No-one is deviating off the course we have to take .

 the world ' highly exposed ' to shocks : BIS <p> Experimental stimulus measures such as money-printing and negative interest rates are creating new vulnerabilities in the financial system that urgently need to be curbed , the powerful Bank for International Settlements says . <p> Amid predictions central banks may respond to the shock Brexit vote by unleashing even looser credit conditions , the BIS annual report on Sunday argued there was an " urgent " need to tackle reliance on a " debt-fuelled growth model " around the world . <p> Known as the central banker 's bank , the Switzerland-based BIS argued central banks must take more account of the risks to financial stability from programs such as ultra-low interest rates , money printing , and negative interest rates . <p> In the past year , it said that around the world , the value of sovereign bonds trading at negative yields had surged from US$2 trillion to almost US$9 trillion , which was creating growing challenges for the banking system . <p> " The persistence of such exceptionally low rates has raised questions about their impact on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asset prices and the broader economy , " said report said , which was produced before Friday 's Brexit vote . <p> Australia 's banks are also feeling the squeeze from record low interest rates on their profit margins , though the report confirmed their place as among the most profitable lenders in the developed world . <p> It said the big four 's income as a percentage of total assets in 2015 , at 1.26 per cent , was second highest in the developed world , behind the United States ' banks ' returns of 1.35 per cent . Chinese banks had the highest returns globally of 1.5 per cent , as emerging market lenders tend to face stronger growth conditions .. <p> Despite gloom around the world economy , the report said global growth was not " anaemic " as often described , but close to its long-term average . <p> It was unrealistic to expect pre-crisis rates of growth , it said . It also warned that global financial stability risks were increasing because of record levels of debt , and that the world economy was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relying on interest rates or monetary policy as it is known the BIS says governments should look to boost investment through their budgets , and by trying to lift productivity . <p> The head of its monetary and economic department , Claudio Borio , said there was an " urgent need " for policy to " re-balance , " and not rely on monetary policy . <p> " We need to abandon the debt-fuelled growth model that has brought us to this predicament , " he said in a statement . " It is essential to relieve monetary policy , which has been overburdened for too long . " <p> The report reflects the view among central banks that there are limits to what cutting interest rates can achieve . <p> After the Brexit turmoil in financial markets late last week , futures markets are betting the Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens will cut official interest rates to a new record low of 1.5 per cent at its August meeting . <p> Mr Stevens said in an April speech the world was reaching the limits of what low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " surely diminishing returns are setting in " . <h> Never Reconsidered Playing

 the Bendigo Art Gallery , a striking addition to the current display is the gallery 's very latest acquisition , , a major work by Sally Gabori ( Mirdidingkingathi Juwarnda ) , one of the leading contemporary Australian artists of the last decade . <p> Purchased with funds donated to the gallery through the gift of Grace and Alec Craig , of Bendigo , this work is a significant addition to the permanent collection . <p> Born in Australia in 1924 , Gabori was a senior Kaiadilt woman artist from Bentinck Island in Queensland 's Gulf of Carpentaria . <p> 's artistic career only began in 2005 , and at this time she took the art world by storm . <p> While her works could be recognised as abstraction , the works actually depict land and seascapes . - Leanne Fitzgibbon <p> Her immediate love of paint and the full spectrum of colour triggered an outpouring of ideas , including depicting her country and her ancestral stories . <p> While her works could be recognised as abstraction , the works actually depict land and seascapes . <p> Executed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fascination with colour , which is as significant as the content itself . <p> Reflecting upon this work , the country , colour and mind 's eye combine to impart to the viewer a real and intimate sense of the artist and where she is from . <p> Most of Gabori 's works represent locations on Bentinck Island of personal significance to the artist : her husband 's place , Country , her father 's place , Thundi , her own country , , and the first outstation , . <p> While her work features in numerous important collections and major institutions within Australia , also made her mark internationally , with her works exhibited in New Zealand , the United Kingdom , USA , Korea , the Netherlands and Italy . <p> In 2013 , Gabori was invited to exhibit in Personal Structures as part of the 55th Venice Biennale . <p> Held at Palazzo Bembo , this exhibition was part of an international art project , and included artists Dale Frank , Sam Jinks , Yoko Ono , Per Hess , Ben Vautier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awarded a successful commission to be part of the new Brisbane International Airport terminal upgrade , a significant accolade and tribute for the artist and her Kaiadilt family .

 in decades <p> START : John Vanston on his Salisbury West property where he has experienced the best start to the season for decades . Picture : Justin McManus . <p> It 's an extreme green farm makeover that is striking in both its speed and outcome . <p> Woolly ewes and their lambs wander around the top paddock of John Vanston 's farm contentedly , chewing clover , rye grass and other fresh fodder as they please . <p> The sheep turn and move towards the ute as he drives through the gate , but they do n't chase him looking for feed anywhere near as fast or persistently as they did just a few short weeks ago . <p> They do n't need to . <p> The hill in the top paddock of the Vanston farm at Salisbury West , located about 45 kilometres north west of Bendigo , delivers an outstanding view of the paddock and neighbouring properties . <p> The entire farm is green , with grass sprouting and dams filling with water . The landscape beyond the boundary fence is also green , in all directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't expect it to happen so quickly ... it just gives you so much more confidence , " he says . <p> But back in the middle of April it was a vastly different story on this 365 hectare property and in the district . <p> The Vanston 's dams were bone dry , their paddocks brown and parched , and confidence across the district was down . <p> Before it started raining " I could n't run anything in here because it was just too dry . I had them ( the sheep ) in another paddock where I was hand feeding them , simply because of the water factor , I had no water up here , " he says . <p> " It 's basically changed in the last three weeks ... we 've got very good growth of all pastures , " he says , while pausing near a dam filling with water . <p> The dam had been dry for about two years . <p> " We 've had six to 6 ? inches ( of rain ) , 150-160 millimetres , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the start of the season , " he says . <p> " I do n't think we 've had this quantity of rain since the mid-70s , or early 70s , at this time of year . <p> " This segment of rain started about the last week in April and it basically has n't stopped . And the most important thing about it is we 're not only getting two and three millimetre rain events , we 're getting eight , 10 , 15 millimetres . <p> " Which means it 's lasting and it keeps the moisture in the ground . We 've got water running into the dams , " he says . <p> For Mr Vanston the regular rainfall is a hugely welcome change . <p> One year ago , he says , his top paddock was " virtually bare dirt .

 said his colleagues need to show respect to one another after one of the longest and most heated council meetings in years saw several instances in which councillors appeared to cause personal offence . <p> Councillor Rod Fyffe said Wednesday night 's City of Greater Bendigo meeting was one of the longest in his 31-year tenure in local government . <p> He said it was also one of the most important in the four-year term of the current council , that ends later this year , which he said led to some " impassioned debate " . <p> " There were a number of major items on the agenda the budget , council plan , organic waste tender , the Big Hill protection plan , the Marong Business Park and that meant people wanted to have their say and that 's terrific , we need a variety of views , " Cr Fyffe said . <p> " We need to be prepared to speak up and we need to listen to them and take that on board in the decisions we make ... and I think we did that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other councillors and take on board what they are saying , whether we 're passionate or not the reality is we have a duty to listen to other councillors and we do need to show respect and not let that passion go too far . " <p> One of the most obvious examples of personal offence and spats over protocol occurred when a number of councillors jostled to speak first on the divisive issue of the Marong Business Park . Councillor Rod Campbell who is wheelchair bound -- rebuked councillor Helen Leach 's persistent attempts to open the account based on the fact she was standing first <p> In closing his argument for the business park , councillor Peter Cox also drew interjections from both Cr Leach and councillor Lisa Ruffell after accusing them of " false information " and not understanding the issue , respectively . <p> " There has been no talk about council spending $1 million let alone $100 million and false information does n't go well when you 're trying to make a point , " Cr Cox said . <p> " And for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial areas for the next 30 years has n't obviously read the report .

 danger of losing two of its traditional strongholds in Bill Shorten 's home state , where the rise of the Greens and a bitter stoush over the CFA could help Malcolm Turnbull return to government in his own right . <p> By 9pm on Saturday , Labor had a swing of 3.12 per cent nationally , but in Victoria where Labor hardheads were hopeful of some gains the swing towards the party was only 1.8 per cent . <p> With 46 per cent of the vote counted , the ALP was at risk of losing the suburban seat of Chisholm vacated by former speaker Anna Burke , while in the inner city , embattled MP David Feeney was under threat from Greens candidate Alex Bhathal , with both sides declaring the contest too close to call . <p> Labor 's chances of winning back the marginal Coalition seat of Corangamite had also been dented early in the vote count with incumbent Sarah Henderson consolidating her position from the last federal poll - but the party had more luck in the regional seat of McEwen , where incumbent MP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The results suggest Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews ' handling of the CFA stoush had some impact throughout the state , but the damage was not as severe as initially feared . <p> Nonetheless , the Premier already faces retribution within federal Labor ranks , with some colleagues privately furious that the firefighters ' dispute proved to be such a distraction in Victoria , making it harder for Mr Shorten to campaign on his home turf and giving the Coalition ammunition to claim that Labor is beholden to the unions . <p> In other preliminary results on Saturday night : <p> Bendigo MP Lisa Chesters was on track to retain her seat with a swing towards Labor . <p> The Liberals appeared set to narrowly hold on in the marginal seats of Dunkley , Deakin and Latrobe . <p> Assistant Treasurer Kelly O'Dwyer looked likely to hold on in the seat of Higgins , despite a swing to the Greens . <p> Labor hardheads were sweating on the outcome of Melbourne Ports , where sitting MP Michael Danby had opted to preference the government ahead of the Greens . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was likely to fall to the Nationals , with former footballer Damian Drum holding 59 per cent of the two-party vote by 9pm . <p> After a marathon eight-week campaign , conventional wisdom suggests that tonight 's election would be won or lost in key battlegrounds across western Sydney and Queensland , with Victoria widely seen as fairly safe territory for Labor , which currently holds 19 out of 37 seats across the state . <p> However , any major losses for Mr Shorten are likely to spark widespread recriminations , with some MPs already turning on Mr Andrews for escalating the CFA dispute in the middle of the campaign . <p> CRONULLA have mounted

That bid followed a decision by InterOil to open its books to potential bidders for the company last year with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full merger at this time . <p> The Oil Search bid coupled with speculation on Friday of a higher offer emerging has resulted in InterOil shares surging 50 per cent this year , compared with a rise of just 2.3 per cent for Oil Search .

 man <p> A man has been ordered to pay cost and compensation of more than $7500 after the Echuca Magistrates Court found him guilty of spraying chemicals without a licence and causing significant damage . <p> The court heard that the man was spraying on behalf of a company , when spray drifted onto a neighbouring field crop , affecting about 90 per cent of the crop and resulting in an estimated $13,800 loss . <p> The man was convicted of five charges and is also on a good behaviour bond for two years . <p> Agriculture Victoria Chemical Standards Officers inspected , photographed and took samples of the affected crop at the time , with laboratory analysis confirming glyphosate residue . <p> Spray records made by the man were also missing key details , such as the full product trade name of the glyphosate product he had used . <p> Agriculture Victoria encourages anyone suspecting to have occurred , or suspecting that someone is not using chemicals lawfully , to contact the Customer Service Centre on 136 186 . <p> For more information on chemical regulation in Victoria @ @ @ @ @ @@@9701526 <p> The result of

 will have no impact locally <p> The resignation of several members of the board of youth mental health service headspace will have no impact locally , the head of the managing body says . <p> Headspace confirmed several board members , including the chairwoman Wendy McCarthy , had resigned . <p> The departures followed the earlier resignation of chief executive officer Chris Tanti . <p> In a statement , interim chairman Ian Marshman said the resignations came with the approval of a new constitution and governance framework for the organisation , which provided for a smaller board and a clarified relationship with the Commonwealth . <p> Matt Jones , chief executive officer of Murray Primary Health Network , which recently took on management of five headspace centres including Bendigo , said there would be no changes associated with the resignations of the board members . <p> " The funding will be at the same level , the services will be at the same level , " Mr Jones said . <p> The new constitution and governance framework have been approved following the introduction of a new funding agreement with the federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferred to primary health networks and other organisations on July 1 . <p> Mr Jones said he was " really pleased " with the transition of the local headspace service 's management to Murray PHN . <p> " It 's been a really positive and really constructive change to that new environment , " he said . <p> GSM , a

 crucial contest against Magpies <p> Kyneton coach says there 's no shying away from the importance of Saturday 's clash against Castlemaine . <p> KYNETON coach Luke Beattie says there 's no shying away from the importance of Saturday 's Bendigo Football-Netball League clash against country rivals Castlemaine at Camp Reserve . <p> KEY CLASH AWAITS : Kyneton coach Luke Beattie . The Tigers take on Castlemaine at Camp Reserve on Saturday in a match crucial to the BFNL finals aspirations of both sides , who each have 5-5 records . Picture : LUKE WEST <p> In arguably the biggest home and away game the two clubs have played against each other this millennium , it shapes as pivotal for the finals aspirations of both . <p> The Tigers and Castlemaine both have 5-5 records , with Kyneton holding onto fifth spot thanks to its superior percentage of 107.8 to the sixth-placed Magpies ' 81.7 . <p> " It 's certainly the most significant home and away game we 've had in recent times and the relevance of the game is not lost on us as a club , " Beattie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 and the winner takes an advantage in the second half of the season . <p> " Whoever loses is going to be chasing their tail a bit ... certainly , it 's not season over , but it 's going to be a significant challenge going forward for whoever does n't get the four points . " <p> With eight rounds left in the season , Beattie is conscious of the Tigers closing the gap between their best and worst and producing a more consistent effort over four quarters . <p> The Tigers have been good enough to inflict what has been one of only two losses Sandhurst has suffered so far in round six , but last round were also just the second team to be beaten by South Bendigo . <p> " We 're mindful of closing that gap , but probably more mindful of how do we achieve that outcome , " Beattie said . <p> " Our best has been fantastic and our worst is an area we 're trying to minimise . <p> " Each game this year , even the Sandhurst game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been able to maintain the mental stability we want . <p> " Apart from the Maryborough game ( round four ) , we 've allowed the opposition to get some ascendancy in each match . We need to put in place some strategies that allow the boys to mitigate those challenges and slow the game down until we can get back to playing our style . " <p> There was no better example of that than round three against Castlemaine when after leading by 30 points at half-time , the Tigers were outscored 48-10 in the third term and ultimately lost by seven points . <h> Central bank turns

 jury hears concerns about disadvantage <p> Leaders from Bendigo 's business , health and not-for-profit sectors have recommended a newly appointed citizens ' jury consider how council policy could address increasing levels of social disadvantage in the city . <p> Among those to speak at the first meeting of the jury on Saturday were the chief executive officers from Bendigo Business Council , Make a Change Australia and Heathcote Health , all of whom shared their shared their concerns about growing inequality throughout Bendigo . <p> Heathcote Health head Dan Douglass said it was important those with a voice speak out on behalf of marginalised communities , like those who lived in generational poverty . <p> " The most disadvantaged end up with the worst health conditions and it does n't seem fair they have so much stacked against them , " he said . <p> He also implored the jury to consider the experiences of people living in rural towns around Bendigo , saying those outside the city often had a tougher time finding work and transport options . <p> But Mr Douglass was complimentary in his assessment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his organisation . <p> The municipality was also regarded warmly in addresses from Bendigo Business Council 's Leah Sertori and social entrepreneur Karen Corr . <p> Both women used their speeches to the jury to advocate for environmental sustainability and renewable energy options . <p> Asked about the need for a citizens ' jury when council already consisted of elected representatives , newDemocracy program manager Georgina Inwood said the forum was an antidote to the public 's cynicism about the democratic process . <p> She said while people could already approach their council representative , the jury setting gave them the chance to collaborate with other members of the public about the direction of their local government . <p> " It 's about giving them time to deliberate , time to explore , " she said . <p> " This is the exact opposite to an opinion poll .

 is launching a new brand strategy after recognising consumer confidence has been down in the dumps for several years despite the low interest rate environment . <p> Using the new tagline More Than Money , NAB hopes to be seen as the bank to use for achieving life 's goals . <p> " More Give , Less Take was right for its time , particularly coming through the global financial crisis , " NAB 's chief marketing office Andrew Knott told BusinessDay , referring to the tagline that has been used since 2010 . That line referred to NAB 's willingness to lend money when the credit crunch made it difficult to get a loan . <p> The problem now is increasing house prices , multiple career changes in a rapidly evolving economy , and a general fear of the unknown . <p> " Consumer degrees of confidence is at an all-time low and has declined over the past three years . We saw that coming through loud and clear in the research , " Mr Knott said . <p> The campaign would show NAB recognises money as an enabler in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . NAB 's campaign uses images of personal goals that are expensive but have little or no financial benefit , such as having children , caring for pets , and growing vegetables . <p> While NAB could not do anything to " fundamentally shift the price of the housing market " , it could help young people buy a house through responsible lending , he added . <p> The campaign was done with Clemenger BBDO Melbourne and will be launched across television , print , out of home , digital and social . <p> Mr Knott 's previous job was with McDonald 's in Asia , overseeing media and digital strategy across the region . He said while hamburgers and home loans had very different levels of commitment from customers , there was common ground in " understanding what the customer needs and how you best meet that " . <p> NAB has focused on improving customer service under chief executive Andrew Thorburn , who in 2014 said customer satisfaction had to be deeply embedded not " a nice little tagline or some simple , superficial things " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tagline , Mr Knott said the brand update was " a reflection of what is occurring in the business " . <p> NAB uses the net promoter score NPS system of measuring customer loyalty . Since 2013 it has improved its score for debt-free customers from -12 to -4 , rising from third best among the big four banks to the best . And from having the worst NPS among small business customers in 2013 with a score of about -18 to the best with a score of -11 , according to a spokeswoman . <p> The bank has removed several " customer pain points " such as a six-week waiting period and hundreds of dollars in fees for customers switching to a fixed interest rate , requiring both joint account holders to be present when opening a new account , and setting up a 24-hour service centre for overseas customers . <h> Dallas police shootings

 big boon for Bendigo <p> ASSET : Shannon Crowe prepares fleece ahead of last year 's Australian Sheep and Wool Show , which represents a considerable economic benefit to the area . Picture : DARREN HOWE <p> BENDIGO can expect to enjoy a significant economic boost from this week 's Australian Sheep and Wool Show . <p> Australian Sheep Breeders ' Association president Malcolm Starritt said the show was shaping up to be the biggest in the event 's 139-year history , with more than 3000 sheep entered , 450 sites and 22 sub-events . <p> Mr Starritt placed the the economic value to the area at $12 million conservatively and said the association had funnelled at least $1 million of its own funds into the Prince of Wales Showgrounds ' infrastructure . <p> The show is expected to bring more than 30,000 people through the gates of the showgrounds over the three days starting Friday , July 15 , about 70 per cent of whom Mr Starritt estimates will come from outside the Bendigo area , some from as far afield as South America , South Africa and Italy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that with so many people expected to attend and the majority from outside the city , he did n't think " anyone would argue that the economic footprint is a good thing for the city " . <p> Mr said recently released figures from Tourism Research Australia suggested the average overnight visitor to the city would spend $220 a day and a day tripper would spend about $100 less . <p> He said the Easter Festival was the only event on Bendigo 's calendar that drew a bigger crowd and accommodation was keenly sought after . <p> The event hopefully put Bendigo on radar of attendees as a possible holiday destination , he said , and possibly also highlighted the city as a potential location for other large events . <p> But Mr said the benefits of such events extended beyond the economic impacts . <p> He said of equal , and perhaps even greater importance , were the social benefits , such as the volunteerism involved and giving people an event in which to be engaged . <p> " I think there 's something uplifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see arguably the best event in its sector , there 's something nice about the fact you can do that in your own home town , " Mr said . <p> The event moved to Bendigo from Melbourne in 1999 and has been held at the showgrounds since . <p> Mr Starritt said Bendigo was chosen as the new home for the event because it was central , was easy to access , and had " terrific opportunities " for a partnership with the Bendigo Agricultural Show Society . <p> It was this partnership , with assistance from the state government , that led to the construction of the Bendigo and Regional Exhibition Centres at the showgrounds , he said . <p> When Malcolm Turnbull 
 refused to allow a man accused of murdering three people in Wedderburn to change his guilty plea . <p> Ian Francis Jamieson , 65 , pleaded guilty to the murders of Greg Holmes , Peter Lockhart and Mary Lockhart , but has since attempted to change his plea to not guilty to one of the murders . <p> Justice Elizabeth Hollingworth refused his request however , and Jamieson will now be sentenced on Friday , July 22 to three counts of murder . <p> Jamieson 's defence team his third after sacking his first two legal teams had attempted to argue he was not of sound mind between April 1 and 5 , when he made the guilty pleas . <p> Jamieson maintains he acted in self defence to the murder of Greg Holmes , and claimed he was stabbed in the leg with a syringe during the struggle despite police finding no evidence . <p> On Monday , Justice Hollingworth had to consider whether a miscarriage of justice had occurred , which would allow for a change of plea . <p> She said there was not enough evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plea . <p> " The application to set aside the plea of guilty will be refused , " Justice Hollingworth said . <p> " I have had the opportunity both of the written submissions before the application was heard , affidavits , reports , transcripts , et cetera , so this is n't a decision made on the spot . <p> " But there 's nothing that ( defence counsel ) Mr Desmond has said either in his supplementary written submissions or orally today that would persuade me that there would be a miscarriage of justice in requiring the plea to stand . " <p> Mr Desmond had earlier attempted to argue that Jamieson 's guilty plea was not " a true admission of guilt " given a perceived " significant cognitive defect " . <p> He said the fact Jamieson always stated his innocence to the murder of Mr Holmes should allow him to change the plea . <p> " Despite having been inconsistent on the other two counts , he 'd always maintained he was acting in self defence and was going to plead not guilty on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the fact Jamieson had repeatedly stated his guilt to police in the aftermath of the murders showed he always believed he was guilty . <p> " He would n't have said what he said to the police in the context of what he knew he had done if he did n't think he was guilty , and he would not , with the legal advice that had been provided to him where the elements were clearly spelt out , he knew that self defence could be a defence to this crime , " he said . <p> " He would not have pleaded guilty to that crime if he did n't believe himself to be guilty .

 eating the right amounts of food is an important part of living healthily and losing excess weight , but portion control can be extra tricky when you 're out and about . <p> Alice Gibson , dietician and PhD candidate at the University of Sydney , says she 's found the answer - fingers . <p> In research published in the Journal of Nutritional Science on Tuesday , Ms Gibson says using finger width , combined with geometric formulas , can lead to " objective " and " acceptably accurate " estimates of the weight of food . <p> " You 're out for dinner and you 're presented with a bowl of food and there 's no really good way to estimate how much you 're eating unless you 're going to whip some scales out of your bag , " she said . <p> " We got people to measure the dimensions of the food using the width of their fingers , and remembering back to primary schools maths , you used the geometric volume formulas to estimate the weight of the food .

" <p> While more research is needed to fine-tune the finger width method , she says the next step is to develop a smartphone app so that calculations are automated and estimating food intake on-the-go is more accurate . <p> The app would involve the user punching in the width of their fingers , as well as their height and weight . <h> Oversupply , investor

 to police plan for zero alcohol in drivers under 26 <p> Melissa Jul 2016 , 10:50 a.m . <p> A push to extend the zero blood alcohol limit to all drivers under 26 has pitted the roads minister against Victoria 's most senior traffic police officer . <p> A suggestion by Victoria 's most senior traffic police officer that the zero blood alcohol limit should be extended to all drivers under 26 has not been backed by the roads minister . <p> The disagreement over the best ways to deal with road safety came as a stretch of road on one of Melbourne 's busiest freeways became the first in Australia to trial dynamic speed limits . <p> Assistant Commissioner Doug Fryer used the 40th anniversary of the introduction of random breath testing in the state to start a discussion widening the drinking ban . <p> " We know young drivers are at the highest risk on our roads and they are consistently over-represented in alcohol-related road trauma , " Mr Fryer said on Monday . <p> A mixture of inexperience and self-determined invincibility leaves them exposed and extremely vulnerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the 468 injured drink-drivers tested in hospital , 31 per cent were aged under 26 . <p> But the roads minister , Luke Donnellan , said expanding drink-driving laws was not being considered by the government . <p> " Victorians rightly find drink-driving abhorrent and that is why the Andrews Labor Government recently tightened laws to deter people from getting behind the wheel while over the limit , " Mr Donnellan said . <p> Any Victorian convicted of drink-driving is required to fit an interlock device and those caught with a blood alcohol content over 0.10 will also have their cars impounded on the spot . <p> In 2014 , of the 468 injured drink-drivers tested in hospital , 31 per cent were aged under 26 . Photo : Alex Ellinghausen <p> Speed limits on the Monash Freeway will move up and down based on live traffic conditions in what the Victorian government describes as an Australian-first technology trial . <p> Mr Donnellan said the trial would allow speed limits to change in response to road conditions , such as an increase or decrease in traffic volumes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-month trial will operate between High Street in Ashburton and Glenferrie Road in Toorak and will see speeds increase from 80km/h to 100km/h when conditions allow . <p> " We 're making the speed on the Monash reflective of the conditions meaning that when it is safe to do so , motorists will be able to travel at 100km/h , " Mr Donnellan said on Monday . <p> It will use existing technology including CCTV , road sensors and overhead electric signs to change the speed limit and if successful could be rolled out across other roadways across Melbourne . <p> The trial will run in three phases which will include changing speeds at night , overnight and off-peak periods and finally 24-hours a day . <p> A PILOT has 
 14 years old when he sat in the passenger seat of his mother 's car , parked near the goals of the Wycheproof oval , and made a startling admission : he did not want to play football anymore . <p> It was an announcement the teenager had dreaded delivering . <p> Not only were his brothers and father both proud Demons , the social life of his hometown centred upon the football club . <p> And as the tallest member of the family , there was an expectation Keane would become his generation 's ruckman . <p> " It 's like a religion and a church to a small town , " Keane said . <p> But for a young man coming to the realisation he was gay , Football Club was not a place he felt welcomed . <p> " I was uncomfortable in the change rooms and on the field in that very blokey , macho culture you often find in football clubs , " he said . <p> " I felt on the outer . " <p> Like many LGBTI people , Keane would carry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in early adulthood . <p> But an article about the An Equal Footing initiative in last Wednesday 's Bendigo Advertiser motivated club leaders to make amends for the culture that had once seen Keane excluded . <p> Coach Julian Bull and player Rory White pushed for An Equal Footing laces to be threaded through every pair of boots that ran out onto the park for the club 's top-of-the-table clash against Charlton on Saturday . <p> The netball and hockey teams also followed suit . <p> Bull said fitting out his squad in rainbow shoelaces was not only a way to embrace the Keane family , who had long served the club , but to amend the perception rural people were somehow less welcoming than their urban peers . <p> " Sometimes country communities can be seen as slightly behind the times , and it 's really good to show it definitely is n't that way , " he said . <p> Sometimes country communities can be seen as slightly behind the times , and it 's really good to show it definitely is n't that way . - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a really good sort of example to be setting to other country towns and leagues . " <p> The coach , who defected from Colbinabbin this year to take on the top job , also invited Keane to speak to his charges before the game . <p> It was an invitation Keane accepted , albeit with some trepidation . <p> " It was an interesting experience because my father , brother , two of my cousins and a lot of school friends were there , people who had contributed to some of the difficulties I 'd experienced as a gay child , " he said . <p> The speech , thanking the players of their support and pressing upon them the hardships faced by gay people in conservative environments , garnered a response very different to the one Keane might have expected ten years ago . <p> Like the wearing of shoelaces , those responses were simple , yet powerful , gestures : shaking hands , respectful nods and an invitation to share a beer at day 's end . <p> Keane 's 25-year-old brother , Tom , travels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was among those who lined up for Saturday 's match . <p> He said it had become easier for him to talk about Matt 's sexuality since he first found out six years ago . <p> " When I was growing up it was n't something that was readily discussed in the footy club or in the community , " he said . <p> " It was always a concern that once it got out you might be alienated from the town , and it was tough to figure out a way to get the word out to family and friends . " <p> Keane 's story is familiar to footballer-turned politician Jason Ball . <p> The Greens candidate for the inner Melbourne seat of Higgins at this year 's federal election became a household name when he publicly came out to , and took a stand against homophobia at , Yarra Glen Football Club . <p> Ball and his team have spearheaded the Pride Cup , an annual diversity-themed match and an event the AFL will echo next month when Sydney and St Kilda meet in the league 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like those taken by the Demons made sports clubs a more welcoming place for people of diverse sexualities and gender identities . <p> " For generations we 've had people who are gay playing sport and feeling like they do n't belong , " he said . <p> " We 've also had people not playing sport , or pulling out , because they do n't feel like that environment is accepting of who they are . " <p> Ball says the language used at football clubs was responsible for many people feeling unwelcome , and it did not have to be homophobic slurs which pushed them away . <p> Even an invitation to invite ' girlfriends ' to a function instead of ' partners ' could ostracise LGBTI players , he said . <p> Tom Keane said on-field talk had cleaned up in recent years , with pejorative terms like ' faggot ' no longer commonplace . However , names used to emasculate players , like ' fairy ' and ' princess ' , were still a problem . <p> " I do n't think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Matt Keane was worried Saturday 's initiative might be an unwelcome distraction for the Demons ahead of the top-two meet , but his home club ran out winners by 64 points . <p> Coverage of the match has meant Keane had to order more rainbow shoelaces . He has now posted about 200 pairs of the multi-coloured accoutrement , which can now be found on the feet of people in every state and territory of Australia . <p> He intends to donate funds from An Equal Footing to the Pinnacle Foundation , an organisation that funds the education of LGBTI youth whose sexuality has seen them face disadvantage . 
 Sheep and Wool Show the largest show of its kind in the world - would not be possible without the hard work of hundreds of volunteers , organisers say . <p> About 250 people donated their time and their elbow grease to the show on Tuesday , setting up the pens ahead of the anticipated arrival of the first sheep on Tuesday night . <p> Australian Sheep Breeders ' Association president Malcolm Starritt said penning day was an " institution " and a chance for some of the show 's attendees to catch up before it all kicked off on Friday morning . <p> He said the first of the volunteers started work about 7.30am beginning their day with a bit of a cooked breakfast and coffee and he expected they would be out by 5pm . <p> Setting up the pens was an enormous job , Mr Starritt said , because every sheep was an individual and had to be penned according to their breed , age , stud and health status . <p> " Everything 's got to be penned correctly for the sheep to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evans , a Dorper breeder from " the other side of Moama " in New South Wales , has been visiting the show for about eight years , and lending his time to help set it up for the past couple of years . <p> On Tuesday morning he was at the Prince of Wales Showgrounds in the building where the merinos will be held , helping cart some of the thousands of hay bales to the pens . <p> Mr Evans said the show always needed volunteers and he did n't mind helping out , adding that he could afford to take some time away from the farm when it was " so nice and green " . <p> But volunteers are involved in far more than setting up the pens . <p> Mr Starritt said the entire show required " an army of volunteers " , with hundreds more working across all aspects of the show , including administration . <p> " It 's extraordinary , " Mr Starritt said . <p> Most of the volunteers came from around Victoria , he said . <p> Site holders will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sheep are expected to arrive on Thursday . <p> This year 's show is expected to be the biggest in its 139 years of existence , with 3000 sheep , 450 sites , 22 sub-events and more than 30,000 people anticipated to attend . <p> The show includes competitions , woolcraft , fashion , food , education , yard dog trials , the state 's shearing championships , cooking and butchering demonstrations , retail , lunch and dinner events , an international conference , and for the first time , the showing of beef breeds . <h> Finalists announced for

 time of quiet contentment Young at Heart <p> I am a summer person . I love nothing more than waking in the morning to bright sunshine and the knowledge that I will be warm all day , in light easy-to-wear clothes and sandals . <p> And yet , and yet , there are some things I simply love about winter that make my heart skip a beat when I wake to hear rain on the roof and wander around my dripping garden . <p> I love the opportunity to do as little as possible . I do n't have to water the garden or feel obliged to go for a hearty walk , or put out the washing . <p> I can give myself leave to just sit and read , or have an afternoon nanny nap , or go to a film , or even bake a cake . Ah ! The freedom it gives me . <p> And then there are the clothes . While I enjoy the lightness and freedom that summer clothes offer me , it is the winter clothes that invite style and elegance , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink into the layered look and enjoy . They cover a multitude of sins ... or I like to pretend they do . <p> In my study I have a rack of all my winter scarves . Scarf drawers are a nightmare . I throw all my winter scarves over the clothes rack and I 'm able to grab one at a moment 's notice . Summer scarves are bundled away until winter has departed <p> I love scarves . Each one of them recalls a story of where I was , what I was doing when I purchased it , or who gave it to me as a present . <p> Whenever and wherever I travel I will buy a scarf to remind me of that particular time and place in my life . They 're much cheaper than shoes . <p> I glance over to that rack . <p> It has a decorative patterned scarf from Egypt which I visited three years ago . The Brotherhood was in power then , and Egyptians were fearful of their future . Today it is still a country struggling to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminds me of my brother 's 80th birthday .

We were snowed in ... quite exciting ! <p> I see a blue silk scarf bought at Apollo Bay on a long weekend in summer with old friends . <p> Next to it a beautiful warm hand-knitted brightly coloured scarf bought when I stayed with a close cousin in Flinders recently .

 win over Fremantle on Friday night did nothing to instil any great confidence in the Cats ' 2016 premiership credentials . <p> However , Patrick Dangerfield would not have lost any admirers as far as his favouritism for the Brownlow Medal is concerned . <p> The brilliant season of the Cats star recruit continued its tour of the country with a match-winning display at Domain Stadium in Perth . <p> He kept his struggling side in the contest in the first half , with three goals and 18 touches . He finished with 31 possessions and four of his side 's 11 goals . <p> As far as the final ladder is concerned , we continue to see just how close the fight for spots inside the top eight is . On Thursday night , the Sydney Swans were on top of the ladder with just over a minute to go in their contest against Hawthorn at the SCG . <p> But when the final siren sounded , the Hawks had moved to first place , with the Swans relegated to second . It 's possible that they could slip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round. ? <p> Conversely , Geelong trailed Fremantle by one point at half-time on Friday night and the live ladder had them in seventh spot . <p> If the Dockers had have continued their run ; if Michael Walters had have continued his dominance in attack ; if Lachie Neale had have continued to lead clearances ; if Stephen Hill had have continued to provide run out of the Dockers defence , Geelong could have been left in eighth spot by Sunday night . <p> Instead , the Cats found a way to claw out an ugly win and wake up on Saturday morning in fourth spot , just three per cent behind the Swans . If they 'd scored a few more goals , they would have only had the Hawks in front of them . <p> Can Geelong stay in the four ? That 's debatable . The next fortnight could determine the Cats ' fate , with games against Adelaide and the Western Bulldogs , both at Simonds Stadium . <p> Dangerfield was sore at half-time against the Dockers , having taken hits to a knee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the final term . <p> It 's unlikely that Dangerfield will be able to enjoy a rest in either of those games either . But if the Cats can win both of those , Chris Scott will surely look to rest his champion over the run home , with games all against sides outside of the eight -- Essendon , Richmond , Brisbane and Melbourne . <p> There is a lot for the Cats to work on , especially in attack , if they are going to finish in the top four . <p> Scott opted for the tall forward line of Tom Hawkins , Shane Kersten and Rhys Stanley against the Dockers . Mitch Clark was left out after a disappointing return to AFL level last weekend . <p> But at half-time against the Dockers , enjoying a 31-17 inside 50 advantage , Hawkins had touched the ball once and Kersten and Stanley just five times apiece . They had one mark inside their attacking 50m between them . <p> Dangerfield had two . <p> At quarter-time , the Dockers led by 16 points , having dominated clearances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> By half-time Dangerfield , Joel Selwood and Zac Smith had started to win the ball at stoppages . Stanley kicked the Cats ' first goal from a clearances eight minutes into the second term to take the margin back to four points and put Geelong back into the contest . <p> In the second half , the Cats gradually gained some momentum . <p> With 50 entries into attack , nine marks in the forward line was not enough . <p> But as has been the Dockers ' problem all season , Pavlich was n't able to inspire them all night ; Walters was n't able to do the miraculous all night and Neale and David Mundy could n't carry the midfield all night . <p> While Hill maintained his standards throughout with a career-high 37 possessions , it did n't help that Michael Barlow could n't play most of the second half because of a shoulder injury . <p> Barlow , who has re-found form in the past couple of months as a run-with midfielder , had last weekend 's loss to Melbourne with a broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ground , with 17 touches and a goal . <p> Just as concerning for the Cats , was the loss of Lachie Henderson , who copped a solid knock in a marking contest with Chris Mayne and he hit the ground hard -- and needed to be stretchered from the ground midway through the third term . He had been a solid defender for the Cats in the opening half . <p> Despite the loss of Henderson , the Dockers had their own issues in attack and were only able to score two goals after half-time from 23 entries into their forward line . <h> Stocks at

She has been axed as small business minister , with that portfolio now downgraded out of cabinet and handed to Nationals MP Michael McCormack . <p> Greg Hunt will move from the environment portfolio to take over Mr Pyne 's former role as industry , innovation and science minister . <p> Mr Turnbull praised Mr Hunt - who was understood to want to shift from the portfolio - as " an outstanding environment minister " . <p> Josh Frydenberg will take on an expanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will join cabinet as minister for resources and Northern Australia . <p> Paul Fletcher will become minister for urban infrastructure . <p> Rising conservative senator Zed Seselja will become assistant minister for social services and multicultural affairs . <p> Mr Turnbull told a press conference at Parliament House on Monday afternoon that his ministers had been chosen on merit . <p> " I am not going to put conservative or moderate or liberal tags on my colleagues , " he said . <p> He also said budget repair will be a " front of mind issue " for the Parliament . <p> Other additions to the assistant ministers ranks including Karen Andrews in vocational education , Alex Hawke in immigration , Keith Pitt in trade , investment and tourism , and Craig Laundy in industry . <p> The frontbench changes were required after two of Mr Turnbull 's assistant ministers lost their seats at the election .

 to turn waste to energy <p> BURNING ISSUE : Council will discuss a plan to secure a waste-to-energy incinerator in Greater Bendigo . <p> Council will discuss a plan to build central Victoria 's first waste-to-energy incinerator on Wednesday night . <p> At this week 's council meeting , a notice of motion will be tabled by councillor Helen Leach that the City of Greater Bendigo investigate the establishment of a regional high intensity incinerator facility to dispose of and process non-organic and non-recyclable household and commercial waste to produce energy . <p> Cr Leach said such a facility would make Bendigo a waste management hub for much of the state and address a number of pressing issues . <p> " I 'm excited about this idea because it would save us a lot of money in the future and inconvenience carting away waste and I know that council has said we do n't want to open any more landfill cells .

We now have a field of " big data analytics " . <p> However , history shows us that mathematical ideas are often developed without any thought of modern applications . Cartesian geometry is a case in point . Ren ? Descartes ( 1596-1650 ) was a French philosopher and mathematician who developed what we call Cartesian geometry . In Cartesian geometry , each point in space can be labelled by coordinates . Curves and surfaces are represented by equations . Descartes turned problems in geometry into problems in algebra . <p> Students who do not like algebra may not regard this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how we could make robots without Cartesian geometry . Somehow you have to instruct the robot to pick up an object in one place and put it down in another . A system of coordinates would seem to be essential for this task . And we can be sure that Descartes would not have been thinking about robots when he developed his ideas more than 300 years ago . The lesson is that , what appears to be useless knowledge today , may be essential for the future . <p> On the other hand , what is important today may be unimportant tomorrow ; the ability to use a slide rule is one example . <p> Advanced ideas in mathematics are built on the basics : arithmetic , algebra , and geometry . For Australia to make the best use of mathematics and its applications , we need teachers who are well trained in , and passionate about , mathematics . <p> The decision follows

 ongoing mystery of pi <p> Wayne Jul 2016 , 9 a.m . <p> WARNING : The following Bushwhacked column contains actual science , mid-level algebra and may contain traces of facts . <p> In secondary school I did a mixed blend of humanities and sciences because I had no idea whatsoever what I wanted to do in life . Still do n't . The humanities subjects seem to have lodged in the deep recesses of the brain while the sciences did n't make it to the end of year 12 . <p> Oh , in the stupid small hours of the morning I can occasionally recite , parrot-fashion , that squared , but the only time that came in handy was when I was dared to jump from a cliff into the sea , and by dropping a rock and timing its fall , I knew I was about 12 metres up . <p> The other thing which has stuck with me all these years is the fascination of pi ( note : not pie . That 's an entirely different , but genuine fascination . ) No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Pi is a truly weird phenomenon in the science world . At school , we learned it was 22 divided by seven . But over the years I 've learned that 's not quite right . It 's the magical number which can allow you to do all sorts of things , such as calculate the surface area of a footy oval , the amount of fencing you need around the oval . Important stuff like that . <p> It is the ratio of a circle 's circumference to its diameter . One other remarkable thing it can do is help you find out how much beer is in a can . <p> Today , ladies and gentlemen is World Pi Day . Yep , it 's July 22 . Clever , eh ? It used to be on March 14 because one simple calculation of its value is 3.14 . Not so clever . <p> In the US , this day is marked by pie eating and pie tossing . Which just goes to show that science geeks need to get out more . <p> Pi is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly puns on its name . You 've got to be careful about this because if you let geeks loose with this stuff , it can end in outbreaks of Morris-dancing . <p> We thought at school that we were oh so clever being able to quote equations which included p. 2pr . And p diameter . <p> Little did we know we were barely standing on the bottom rung of the scientific ladder . Indeed , those who had gone as much as two millennia before us were much smarter . <p> The mathematical constant p was known in at least Egypt and China before our year zero . It is thought to have been part of the process in calculating how to build the pyramids . In antiquity it 's known the Chinese calculated it to the seventh decimal point . The Indians calculated it to the fifth decimal . <p> The Babylonians first calculated it as 25 divided by eight . The Egyptians used 256 divided by 81 . We now reckon 22 divided by seven is close enough . <p> But the actual , final value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , it was calculated to the 11th decimal place both in England and India . <p> Last year , a computer took 23 days to calculate it to the two quadrillionth place . <p> That 's amazing . But it 's even more amazing that people in vastly different parts of the ancient world came up with the same value around the same time . <p> How did they arrive at this magical constant ? Who was the first person to wake up with pi on his mind ? <p> We think we 're so scientifically advanced in 2016 , but can you imagine the metal discipline it must have taken someone in India or Babylon more than 2000 years ago to even arrive at the mathematical concept of p ? Happy Pi Day , you saucy lot . <h> Kohli century puts

 against greyhound facility north of Bendigo <p> Loddon Shire Council will work with the operator of a Campbells Forest greyhound facility to bring it to the required standard after VCAT refused to issue a permit . All greyhounds will be removed in the meantime . <p> LODDON Shire Council will work with the operator of a greyhound breeding facility north of Bendigo to bring it to the required standard after the state 's planning tribunal refused to grant it a permit . <p> The facility at Campbells Forest , which houses about 30 greyhounds , had not met its requirements on two previous permits since 2006 before Loddon Shire voted to refuse a third permit in October . <p> The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal heard the matter earlier this month , and backed the council 's decision after finding the operator had not provided enough information about effluent disposal , acoustics and visual impact . <p> In the ruling , presiding VCAT member Geoffrey Code said there were too many " uncertainties " with the greyhound training facility . <p> " Insufficient evidence was led on these matters that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposal , " he said . <p> " In some proceedings , permit conditions can be imposed to address uncertainties with the proposals and their impacts . The extent of the uncertainties in this proposal mean this option is not open to us . <p> " No permit will be granted . " <p> The operator had applied to house up to 60 greyhounds at the site , which includes three kennel buildings and adjoining runs , no reticulated water or sewerage , and no fixed dwelling on the land . <p> In 2006 , the operator applied to breed and rear greyhounds . Seven years later , another application was made to Loddon Shire to keep greyhounds . Both applications expired due to a lack of information . <p> The operator applied for a third time in February 2014 , which was eventually refused . VCAT stated it was " regrettable " Loddon Shire had taken 21 months to consider the permit . Councillors voted against the permit despite officers recommending its approval . <p> VCAT also found it was unlikely there would be people at the property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan to double the number of greyhounds . <p> The permit received six objections , with concerns about noise , animal welfare issues and possible pollution of a nearby waterway . <p> At the facility , liquid waste from the greyhounds is " disposed of directly to the soil " as the kennels are not hard paved . <p> Loddon Shire chief executive officer Phil Pinyon said the council would work with the operator to help bring the facility to the required standard . <p> " At the present , we 're working with the operator so that he can comply with the directions , " he said . <p> " We are prepared to give him a bit of time , but not too much . <p> " In the meantime , he will cease use of the site .

 Grant has delivered an impassioned speech on Aboriginal rights and recognition following the mistreatment of Indigenous boys in detention in the Northern Territory . <p> Accepting an honorary doctorate of letters at the University of New South Wales on Friday night , Grant was due to present the Wallace Wurth Public Lecture . <p> He began by saying there was a speech he wanted to give -- one that appealed to the best of Australia , used carefully-chosen words , and sought to comfort , instead of inflame . <p> However , after vision emerged on ABC 's Four Corners program of young Indigenous boys in custody being tear gassed and strapped into chairs wearing hoods , he said his previous speech was " best saved for another day " , and he would instead speak from his heart . <p> " This week I have struggled to contain a pulsating rage , " Grant said . " I have moved from boiling anger to simmering resentment but the feeling has not passed nor do I wish it to . Even as I write , my words are powered by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clenched fist . <p> " This is an anger that comes from the certainty of being . This is an anger that speaks to my soul . This anger I know to be just . " <p> He invoked Abraham Lincoln 's second inaugural address , where he stood before a country " bloodied and worn " . <p> " How can I stand here and speak to the idea of our place in an indissoluble Commonwealth when this week my people have been reminded that our place is so often behind this nation 's bars , " Grant said , beginning to shake slightly , with moistened eyes . <p> " This week we know what Australia looks like . This week Australia is a boy in a hood in a cell . This week Australia is Aboriginal boys tear gassed , locked down and beaten . These are the images on our television screens . The boys who look like my boys . " <p> Grant said he watched his teenage son lose his place in the world as the scenes unfolded : " with each scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " For he has been raised not to believe in our worst , " Grant said . " He has been spared the fate of so many of his people . But on that night he wondered at the difference between himself and the boys on the screen . " <p> Grant said the images reminded him of his father , who was imprisoned , and his grandfather , who was dragged out of bed and tied to a tree " like a dog " in living memory . <p> He said some people would rather he did n't speak about such events : people who accused him of having " a nostalgia for injustice " . <p> " It is a charge brought by people comfortable in their own history while they tell us to forget ours -- to get over it , " Grant said . <p> " These people would tell those boys on our television screens this week the boys crying in agony that they live in an imagined world of pain . They would tell them that they are to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ten-year-old Indigenous girl who takes her own life that they live in an imagined world of sadness . <p> " They would tell our people in overcrowded housing in communities ravaged by violence and drug and alcohol abuse that they revelling in their misery . They tell me I have a nostalgia for injustice . No , we have no nostalgia for injustice , because we have not first had the chance to forget . " <p> Grant said that , like " the graveyard crosses of people gone too young " , the images of this week were seared into his mind 's eye " as sure the charred flesh and the stench of blood from a lifetime of reporting haunts my night 's sleep " . <p> " Australia was redeemed in part from complicity in this disgrace only by the national outrage , " Grant said . <p> " The prime minister responded by calling immediately for a Royal Commission . It may meet a minimum requirement for action but forgive us if we lack faith . " <p> Grant called instead for a truth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's past , that may set loose the chains of history that bind this country 's first and , today , most miserably impoverished people " . <p> " In my caution I have argued against such things fearing it would harden division , " Grant said . " Now I accept that we need this mirror into our soul . <p> " If we are to remember the fallen of Pozieres and Fromelles , then surely we can remember the fallen warriors who resisted the invasion of their lands on this soil two hundred plus years ago . " <p> Grant said he lives in the " enormous shadow " of people like Eddie Mabo and Charles Perkins , who fought for the rights of Indigenous people . <p> " I turn to the speech I had hoped to give . I recalled the words of Lincoln 's first inaugural , his appeal to his nation 's better angels . <p> " I return to the words of the weary Lincoln . The Lincoln at the start of his second term , a man whose death stalked him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in , to bind up the nation 's wounds ' . " <h> Debra Messing , 
 are no winners in school closure saga <p> EDITORIAL : It is tempting to find someone to blame when decisions have negative consequences . <p> The Yolngu people of East Arnhem Land have a word which translates as " look up to the future " . <p> When it came to naming a school aimed at preparing future generations of Yolngu for the challenges that lay ahead in 1972 , Gumatj clan elder Yunupingu chose " College " . <p> ESU year 10 student Riley Hunter worries about his future once the school closes . Picture : NONI HYETT <p> That school closed in 1981 , and the story behind its closure and the devastating impact it had on the local community , already contending with the unique challenges faced by Australia 's Indigenous population , is best left to others . <p> But parents of students at Anglicare Victoria 's Educational Services Unit who spoke to the Bendigo Advertiser following news of its slated closure this week , can no doubt relate to the despair the Yolngu people felt at the time . <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made which have far-reaching negative consequences for the lives of young people , the reality is -- unlike the situation in East Arnhem Land where the school closure was a decision of the Northern Territory government there are no bad guys here . <p> Anglicare is a not-for-profit organisation which provides much-needed services for disadvantaged people across the state . <p> It does not have unlimited resources and as such must at times make difficult decisions about where its current priorities lie , and there will always be winners and losers . <p> Nor is it obliged to keep the ESU open as it is a state government responsibility to ensure every Victorian student receives an appropriate education . <p> Though it appears the government is no more at fault , as it was not even aware of the decision to close the school until Thursday . <p> And there lies the real problem : communication . <p> Where Anglicare is at fault is in its handling of the decision to close the ESU . <p> By engaging more with parents in the lead-up to the decision and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much of the heartache could have been avoided . <p> Regardless , parents like Leanne Cullen are now left to worry about how her son , Riley Hunter , will " look up to the future " . <p> " They talk about kids needing education to get somewhere in life but if they take the education away that 's available for them , how do they get a chance at life ? " she asked . <p> With the start 
 and academic Waleed Aly has been accused of failing to stand up for artists or arts funding in a provocative essay attacking Australia Council . <p> In When the Goal Posts Move , academic and writer Ben Eltham says that Aly , a board member of Australia Council , has stayed silent on the dramatic budget cuts inflicted by the federal government on its arts funding agency . <p> Eltham argues in the essay published by Currency House that " Aly 's public record on Australia Council funding is plain enough : there is none " . <p> " The Gold Logie winner could have been the arts sector 's most eloquent spokesperson : after all , he has his own television show , " he says . " But at the time of writing , he had so far declined to publicly defend the agency . " <p> Aly is one of 12 board members of Australia Council , which Eltham says has failed to discharge its duties to promote freedom of expression and appreciation of the arts in the face of savage budget cuts . <p> He is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputy chairwoman of Australia Council , " whose statements about the funding cuts have been equivocal , to say the least " . <p> In response , Aly says it is not his job to publicly defend the agency . <p> " I 've not been given a public-facing role and it 's not for me to usurp the chairman or the CEO 's function just because I happen to work in the media , " he says . <p> Aly also says he is not free to comment on the federal government 's handling of the arts portfolio while he sits on the Australia Council board . <p> " We have an advisory role - and there has certainly been plenty of advice given , " he says . " We can also outline the impact policy will have on the Council - which , we do regularly , and which was evidenced in , for example , the collapse of six-year funding . Beyond that , we have to do the best we can with the resources we 're assigned . " <p> Eltham says the independence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A different membership might have acted differently in response to the unprecedented attack ; it 's difficult to imagine Donald Horne , when he was chair , staying silent if this had happened on his watch , " Eltham says . " But nothing has come to pass . In response to the wholesale assault on the organisation 's statutory independence , the Australia Council rolled over . " <p> Australia Council spokeswoman Kate Clark offered a lengthy defence of the agency : " As a Commonwealth agency we are required to work with the policy of the government . " <p> She said Australia Council had continued to advocate on behalf of the arts over the past 12 months : " That advocacy take many forms , particularly as a Commonwealth agency , and it is a one dimensional view that sees the media as the only avenue for that critical work , " she said . <p> Eltham 's essay traces the development of arts policy in Australia and what he calls the " excellence raid " in 2015 . <p> Former arts minister George Brandis ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget to a new fund , the National Program for Excellence in the Arts , administered by his office . <p> Eltham also takes aim at the board members of the 28 major performing arts institutions -- many Liberal Party donors such as the Sydney Theatre Company , Opera Australia and Australian Ballet . <p> " Given that they had been quarantined from the funding cuts , they arguably had nothing to lose , " he says . <p> Eltham says artistic leaders such as the Australian Chamber Orchestra 's director Richard Tognetti ? and Opera Australia 's Lyndon are public figures whose advocacy would attract attention . <p> " But in the climate of fear ( or was it indifference ? ) that Brandis ' funding raid induced , the major performing arts companies largely stayed silent , " he says . <p> New Sydney Festival director Wesley Enoch ? was among the few leaders who spoke out , Eltham says . " In contrast , Opera Australia callously welcomed the changes , and other artistic directors said nothing . " <p> Eltham says Australia Council 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 election , the Australia Council now finds itself in a dangerous place , " he says . " There is little love on the Coalition backbench for the organisation , and the election of a second-term Turnbull government could well signal the beginning of the end for the agency . " <p> A spokeswoman for Senator Fifield said : " The government is not proposing any changes to the Australia Council . " <p> Eltham likens the attacks on the Australia Council to what he labels as assaults on areas like climate science and the universities : " The target is those remnant sections of Australian society that still support or endorse non-market values . " <p> He says there is an increasingly inhospitable intellectual climate for the public support of culture . <p> Eltham also echoes earlier complaints about the increasing presence of businesspeople on arts boards at the expense of artists . <p> " For instance , no-one seems to think it a problem that the chairman of the Sydney Theatre Company is Ian Narev ? , the CEO of a major bank , " he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " In a neo-liberal world , business know-how is transferable to any cultural endeavour . But would an actor ever be appointed chair of the Commonwealth Bank ? " <p> He says it is improbable that an artist or festival director would be asked by government to lead an inquiry into the banking sector .@@13604536 <h> Ancelotti unhappy with

 Holmes and Erek Ladd <p> The meeting : Erek was holidaying in Bendigo from his home country of the United States . Whilst there to visit friends , whom were Amber 's family , the two were introduced with the sly intentions of playing Cupid . Our first meeting was a casual pizza party setting amongst friends . From there , Erek suggested Amber help him find his way around the foreign town , to which she gladly accepted . <p> The proposal : After 11 months of dating , Erek returned to the United States due to his visa expiring . Amber would stay in Bendigo to complete her university studies . While Erek had been working towards plans to return to Bendigo for Christmas , Amber surprised him by showing up on his doorstep in October . It was a beautiful reunion and come January 11 , Erek surprised her with a proposal in his hometown of Central Square , New York . They went down to the local park , Crossroads Park , where he had set up a camera as a distraction for some photography of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his knee and proposed . <p> The wedding day : They were married April 2 in the Ladd Family Barn in Central Square . The property and barn had been in the family since the early 1800s . The barn was decorated to reflect on the history of the location , but also to show the new life and marriage that was being created there . <p> The styling was chic , provincial and vintage , designed by Amber , a graphic designer with a love of all things antique and retro . The colour scheme could be described as whites , woods , and twine , with beautiful white roses adorning the location . It was a small occasion with only 30 of our closest friends and family in attendance , including Amber 's parents , siblings , and grandmother who made the 16,000 km journey to attend . The atmosphere was light , fun and happy , but also an amazing experience to witness the coming together of people from two opposite sides of the world . Following the ceremony , there was a lunchtime reception held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was remodelled and decorated to match the wedding theme . Due to the relaxed nature , as well as number of children in attendance , the decision was made to have a pizza wedding ! We had seen the idea on Pinterest , and styled correctly , it actually looked quite beautiful ! It was also a " throwback " to our original meeting . <p> The dress : The dress was a beautiful knee-length tea dress purchased by Amber 's mother , Belinda Holmes , from Bendigo Bridal Collections . It was everything she had envisioned with a gorgeous white lace overlay and long transparent sleeves with white trim to keep warm in the cooler month the wedding was to be set . She chose the dress via an online video chat - it was the last of that design left and in her size ! After several days of anxious anticipation , the dress arrived in the mail and even more beautiful in person . <h> Tickets for Show

 Beckett and Ben Dealy <p> The meeting : Our story began when we met as high school students eight years ago . There was an immediate physical attraction . Our first conversation was when Ben came over to have a chat when I was kicking the footy in the park . The fact that Ben was able to drive was also a drawcard in the early days ! ? <p> The proposal : I had been extremely busy with work and night school and was desperate for a day off work . I just wanted to stay home and relax however Ben pushed that we go on a day trip . Ben took me to Mt Buller and we spent the day in the snow . On the way back down the mountain we pulled over to look at a beautiful waterfall where the snow was melting and running from the mountain . I was standing on top of a picnic table when Ben said " I have a surprise for you " . As I turned around he was standing below me with a ring box . He then asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put that beautiful ring on my finger . Eventually after running through every emotion I said Yes ! <p> A stand out moment was when I called dad " Dad I can not stop smiling " his response " how do you think me and your mother feel , we have known for days ! " <p> Ben had completely surprised me with an amazing ring he had chosen himself and with an unexpected proposal . <p> The wedding day : The moment we walked into Moama on Murray resort we felt relaxed and peaceful . We chose the Riverside Function area as the river setting with the beautiful gumtrees is exactly what we both had visioned . <p> It set a very tranquil vibe . Another advantage was all accommodation was on site so it was convenient for our guests and made them feel like they have had a weekend away . <p> The Ivy Mill was responsible for our ceremony and reception styling which really completed an already stunning setting . <p> The dress : Dress was purchased from Raffaele Ciuca . As clich ? as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first dress I had tried on and I just immediately knew it was my dress . I could not wipe the smile off my face . For my mums benefit we went to lunch to have a think about the dress before purchasing it but I knew it was the dress for me .

The project aims to promote women 's participation and opportunities ; challenge violence supportive attitudes , gender stereotypes and roles ; and encourage critical thinking about structures that might reinforce inequality . <p> Sexual violence is an abuse of power which most often comes from rigid gender stereotypes . While sexual violence can happen to anyone , regardless of sex , sexuality and gender identity , women and children are statistically more likely to be victims and perpetrators are usually male . <p> La Trobe University Bendigo head of campus Robert Stephenson is correct in saying staff and students should be able to work and study in a safe environment . <p> Universities Australia 's intention is the data from the survey will serve as even stronger evidence for prevention strategies and education .

 the failed financial institution Banksia could expect a moderate windfall in the coming months as a $13.25 million Supreme Court settlement approaches approval . <p> The Supreme Court settlement against Bendigo-based accounting firm Richmond Sinnott and Delahunty , as well as Banksia directors and solicitors , would add another two cents in the dollar to investor returns . <p> The total returned would rise to 82 cents in the dollar . <p> On Thursday , Justice Ross Robson indicated he would support the settlement , but reserved his judgement for a later date . <p> The major part of the class action a claim for $133 million plus interest from the trustee is expected to go before the court in March 2017 , as liquidators complete the wind-up of Banksia . <p> Despite the likelihood of more money for investors , members of the group launching the class action were " extremely disappointed " with the $13.25 million figure . <p> In a statement , co-founders of the Kyabram Banksia Debenture Holders Actions Group , Doug Crow and Don McKenzie , said the amount was at least " reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Given that the trustee will also be taking action against these parties , it is felt that the settlement is probably as good a result as could be expected , " the statement read . <p> " ( We ) hold out hope that the action being taken against the most culpable party , in our opinion ( the trustee company ) ... will produce a substantial settlement when it goes to court in March 2017 .

 prevent us from digging deeper <p> THE tendency for humans to make snap judgements about others has been the subject of extensive psychological study . <p> Researchers have spent countless hours cataloguing the cues that lead us to draw conclusions based only on surface traits . <p> You can be certain , however , they have spent far , far longer investigating just how accurate these assessments actually are . <p> A walk through Bendigo 's Hargreaves Mall is the perfect playground for someone wishing to conduct such an experiment . <p> But , based on the experiences of Bendigo Police sergeant Matt Hunt and his colleagues , the results might surprise you . <p> If you see a youth in the mall during school hours , it is easy to assume they are wagging school and up to no good . <p> This hunch can then be either strengthened or weakened , depending on each individual 's own prejudices . <p> The length of that person 's hair , the clothes they are dressed in , the tone of their voice , the presence of tattoos or piercings even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin can influence our perceptions . <p> But what if we actually stopped to talk to that person to find out why they are in mall at that particular hour on that particular day ? <p> Would your snap judgement be changed if you learnt that person had a mental health issue , or was escaping a volatile home life , or was regularly bullied at school ? <p> Digging deeper into these people 's lives is precisely what Sergeant Hunt and his fellow officers have been doing over the past six weeks . <p> They have taken the time to engage with some of the youths who congregate in the mall to find out the circumstances that have led them there . This proactive policing program , which will be extended beyond the mall to other parts of Bendigo , has already reaped benefits . <p> One 18-year-old , who was a frequent and known troublemaker among shopkeepers , was referred to a mental health service for treatment .

 $2.5 billion through the pokers each year <p> NSW : Every week , the Illawarra feeds nearly $50 million through the pokies . <p> " Essentially many of the community services provided by clubs are helped being funded by the most marginalised and vulnerable people , who have an addiction , " UOW 's Dr Melanie Randle says . <p> Every week , the Illawarra feeds nearly $50 million through the pokies . <p> That 's a rate of $158 a week per resident and a yearly total of just under $2.5 billion . <p> A Mercury analysis of the latest Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority figures on poker machine turnover reveals the region pumped about $80 million more through gaming machines in 2014/15 than in the previous year . <p> And while the " turnover " figures refer to the total value of bets made on gaming machines including bets that are made using credits won during the course of play the losses are also staggering . <p> " The average return of all gaming machines over this period was about 90 per cent , " the spokesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single playing session varies - a player may win more than they put into a machine or they may lose more than 15% . " <p> Using these assumptions , the region lost a collective $250 million to the pokies in 2014/15 . <p> High stakes : Wollongong had 48 fewer gaming machines in 2014/15 than the previous year , but pumped $37 million more through the pokies . <p> Unsurprisingly , the Wollongong Local Government Area had the biggest poker machine turnover , with $1.85 billion pushed through more than 3000 gaming machines . <p> Averaged across the city 's 210,000 residents , that 's almost $8800 put through ( or $880 lost ) per resident . <p> In Shellharbour , $549 million was pushed through the city 's 868 gaming machines roughly per resident each year . <p> In Kiama where there are only 272 poker machines the yearly turnover was $82 million , or $381 lost per resident . <p> Of course , these figures use the entire region 's population and no doubt include many people who do n't gamble , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Melanie Gamble a marketing researcher at the University of Wollongong has been part of a team conducting research into gambling , and says average problem gamblers would be losing much more than the above figures . <p> " We know that pokies are more likely to be the gambling mechanism of choice for problem gamblers , and people who play the pokies are far more likely to become problem gamblers than those who engage in other forms of gambling , " Dr Randle said . <p> Indeed , national statistics show one in six people who play the pokies has a serious addiction , and three quarters of problem gamblers have problems with poker machines . <p> " Problem gamblers often come from groups within the community that are quite vulnerable - for instance they are more likely to be from backgrounds of disadvantage or lower socioeconomic status , " Dr Randle said . <p> Blowing up : While Kiama LGA had the lowest poker machine turnover in the Illawarra in 2014/15 , spending grew the fastest - jumping 9.4 per cent from 2013/14 <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerable groups , and while clubs say ' well , we redistribute the money to the community ' and that may be true , it is not necessarily going back to the people that lost it . " <p> " So essentially many of the community services provided by clubs are helped being funded by the most marginalised and vulnerable people , who have an addiction . " <p> The increase of $4.3 billion - or 6 per cent - was despite the number of gaming machines operating in NSW pubs and clubs falling by 244 to 93,364 in the same period . <p> Dr Randle said gambling was becoming " far more pervasive in our culture " , with increasingly sophisticated poker machines targeting specific people and becoming an accepted form of entertainment . <p> She also said young children were being exposed to poker machines because of their prevalence in family friendly clubs . <p> " In NSW most pokies are placed within clubs , and those clubs often include products that attract families and children , for example you can get cheap meals which suit families , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . <p> " In theory , the pokies are supposed to be out of sight within clubs , but in some of them you can see the poker machines from areas which do allow children . <p> " Some of the research we 've done recently has shown that young children do know that poker machines are there - they see the lights , they hear music - and they are essentially becoming normalised as part of the club 's environment .

" <p> Mr Ruff 's banking career actually started 18 months before he joined the SBS , when he worked across the road from the current Bendigo Bank headquarters in Bath Lane at the Commercial Bank of Australia . <p> And it was young love , which at the age of 19 led him to make the switch to the company now known as the Bendigo Bank . <p> " I 'd actually met a girl and I did n't want to leave Bendigo because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , " he says . <p> " I shifted up to the Sandhurst Building Society and that girl 's been my wife for the past 47 years , so I think it was a pretty good decision .

 Research can share light on history <p> With a proud history , Bendigo hospital has been a cornerstone of the community . However , historically , it has been an unusual institution . <p> As Bendigo prepares for the opening of its new hospital next year , it is timely to unravel its intriguing past . <p> With a proud , 160-year history , the hospital has been a cornerstone of the community . <p> However , historically , it has been an unusual institution . <p> An intriguing element of its story is a dramatic rise in the rate of surgical operations completed during the 1890s . <p> Performing fewer than 100 operations a year prior to 1893 , the hospital 's resident and honorary surgeons suddenly increased the rate to 224 operations a year in 1895 . <p> Many of the operations were amputations , hernia repairs , removals of hydatid cysts and tumour excisions . <p> Clearly the service was required . But why did the hospital suddenly increase its surgical intake in 1893 so dramatically ? <p> The increase likely relates to an abrupt change in medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bendigo 's hospital at odds with most major hospitals throughout Australia and Britain . <p> The norm was for large , charitable hospitals to allow their honorary doctors that is , qualified but unpaid doctors not on staff -- to control their medical facilities , including wards and operating rooms . <p> In contrast , for most of its life , Bendigo Hospital steadfastly refused to relinquish control to its honoraries . <p> For many years , the honoraries felt disrespected by the hospital 's policy . <p> An honorary position at a major hospital was a perk for medical practitioners it gave them prestige and access to a rich collection of interesting cases . <p> Typically , they were granted authority over the wards and patients in exchange for their services . <p> Not so at Bendigo , where the lay committee of management gave sole authority of their wards and patients to its salaried resident surgeons . <p> With Bendigo 's committee holding firm to its policy , it is possible the honorary doctors of the late 19th century retaliated by boycotting surgery at the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of surgery prior to 1893 . <p> In 1892 , under financial pressure , the hospital finally agreed to conduct an " honorary trial " which handed control to the unpaid honorary doctors . <p> After averaging just one operation for every 18 admissions from 1875-92 , the hospital suddenly experienced a surgical boom , performing up to one operation for every three admissions during the trial years . <p> After six years , the hospital abruptly stripped the honoraries of their authority and refused to allow them control again for another 30 years . <p> The problem , it was suggested at the time , was that the honoraries were performing too much surgery . <p> These events say something not only about the hospital 's management , but medical practice in regional centres such as Bendigo in the 19th century . <p> It is only through careful investigation , based on the historical records available today , that we can solve these mysteries and she 'd light on a proud institution so many of Bendigo 's locals love and respect . <p> If you can provide historical documents that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and correspondence from the private practices of Bendigo 's doctors during the 1890s please email **32;55;TOOLONG@@14100072 <h> Sydney Airport is 
 heralds twilight of easy European tax deals <p> The days when big multinational technology companies could easily slice tax bills in Europe are coming to an end . <p> For decades , businesses like Apple that generate significant revenue around the globe flocked to Ireland , the Netherlands and Luxembourg , where they counted on amenable fiscal regimes to reduce their tax , even if they had minimal operations on the ground . <p> " Every global company that is exposed to EU taxes in individual nations now has to look back and ask whether any of their agreements are subject to similar attacks , " said Thomas Cooke , a professor at Georgetown 's McDonough School of Business . " This is the first signal of a long play that 's going to take place over many , many months . " <p> Every time an iPhone or iPad is purchased in London , Paris or Milan , Apple books the profit at a subsidiary in the Irish city of Cork . The process is part of a decades-long arrangement with the Irish government that 's allowed the company to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission ruled that Ireland gave Apple illegally favourable tax treatment , letting it pay an effective tax rate on European profits of 1 per cent in 2003 and down to 0.005 per cent in 2014 . Apple and Ireland vowed to appeal . <p> Source : European Commission <p> Apple 's Irish tax arrangement was considered " the most brazen " among multinational techy companies , said Aisling Donohue , a partner at tax and business advisory firm in Ireland . While other companies should be concerned , they are n't likely to face as much scrutiny , she said . <h> Broader push <p> Still , Vestager 's move is part of a broader push to close loopholes that European regulators think give foreign companies an advantage . Google parent Alphabet has also been a beneficiary of Ireland 's tax regime , using the so-called " Double Irish " mechanism to save billions in tax on its international earnings . Ireland is phasing this out , although companies have until 2021 to adjust . <p> Amazon.com used a similar process to effectively send profit through Luxembourg . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property behind its web shopping platform was immensely valuable , justifying the billions in tax-free revenue it collected there since moving its technology assets to Luxembourg a decade ago . In the US it played down the value of those same assets to explain why it paid so little in taxes for licensing them . That prompted investigations on both sides of the Atlantic and Amazon changed its policy in 2015 , largely eliminating the practice . <p> " You ca n't bank on achieving the savings in post-tax profits that you might have once expected , " said Jolyon Maugham , a British trial lawyer specialising in tax cases at Devereux Chambers . " That makes the pursuit of such strategies rather more difficult to justify . " <h> Unsustainable <p> About six months ago , Netflix told an investor that the company will likely pay higher international tax rates than other large US technology companies currently pay . Netflix , which recently began expanding aggressively abroad , said it views other US tech companies ' international tax strategies as unsustainable , according to a person familiar with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recounting a private discussion . <p> " Multinationals with aggressive tax planning strategies can expect to pay more tax , " Sarah Jane Mahmud , a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst , wrote in a recent research note . " EU reforms will require income to be taxed where generated through , among other things , new restrictions on use of controlled foreign companies . " <h> ' Apple follows the law ' <p> Even if Apple has to pay billions and other tax strategies fizzle , Ireland 's 12.5 per cent corporate rate means it 's still likely to trump its homemarket US as a preferred corporate tax domicile . The iPhone maker has been there since opening a factory in Cork in 1980 . <p> " We received guidance from Irish tax authorities on how to comply correctly with Irish tax law - the same kind of guidance available to any company doing business there , " CEO Tim Cook said in a statement . " In Ireland and in every country where we operate , Apple follows the law and we pay all the taxes we owe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US presidential election , means tax reform may become a more prominent issue . Donald Trump proposed taxing companies ' accumulated offshore profit at 10 per cent , compared with the current top corporate rate of 35 per cent . The tax Apple pays abroad is deductible from the 35 per cent it must pay should it bring offshore profits home . <h> Implications for other multinationals <p> One major tech investor said low European taxes do n't help international investors because the resulting higher overseas profits are still out of reach for things like share buybacks , dividends and acquisitions of other global companies . If European tax rates rise , there would be more incentive to repatriate the money to the countries where revenues are generated , said the investor , who asked not to be named discussing internal strategy ideas . The Apple ruling adds more pressure on the US to overhaul its tax system . <p> And the US is not the only market where calls to end multinationals ' tax dodging will get new intensity : According to a report published by Oxfam in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion in annual revenue from big international companies operating here but using low-tax or no-tax nations to avoid paying tax locally . Apart from Ireland , the tax havens cited in the report included other European nations such as the Netherlands , Malta , Luxembourg , Belgium and Austria . <p> Meanwhile , for Apple and its rivals , there 's another sting in the spectacular Ireland ruling : The revelation that a regulator can impose higher tax bills retroactively - even though they were legal according to national laws - will top companies ' list of concerns , according to Adam Halpern , a tax lawyer at Fenwick &amp; West . <p> " You thought you understood what your risk profile was in terms of tax , and then a regional non-governmental agency comes in and tells you to pay more , " he said . <p> South Africa lost 
 : council <p> Bendigo councillors have backed a plea to save an Epsom Primary School building from demolition . <p> Aye : Mayor Rod Fyffe at Wednesday night 's meeting , during which councillors voted to protect a historic school building from demolition . <p> Bendigo councillors voted to endorse a request from the city for Planning Minister Richard Wynne to intervene to halt the demolition of part of Epsom Primary School at Wednesday night 's regular meeting . <p> Councillor Peter Cox spoke in favour of the motion , saying the city 's hand had been forced by the fact an application to demolish the school would be automatically allowed to proceed if Mr Wynne did not place an interim heritage protection order on the 1881 building . <p> " What this motion does is puts a process in place , we 're asking the minister to provide an interim heritage order so all the parties can come together and decide what 's best for the future , " Cr Cox said . <p> " It 's a relatively small building but it 's right on the boundary on Howard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heritage plays a big role in streetscapes , so with it being on the boundary and with Epsom losing many of its former heritage buildings , this is a particularly important site . " <p> Councillor Elise Chapman put the other side of the argument , reading from a letter from the Epsom Primary School Council , which outlined concerns the building would not fit in with the school 's planned $5.7 million redevelopment . <p> " It 's poorly positioned , out of place with the new school 's design and would be expensive for the school to maintain , " Cr Chapman read . <p> " Those comment are from the people who are actually living it , so I just could n't let it go without voicing their concerns , " she said . <p> The meeting was also the current council 's last opportunity to award contracts worth more than before entering caretaker mode , and a number of major projects got the go ahead , including the Bendigo Tennis Centre redevelopment and the White Hills Botanic Gardens Garden for the Future project . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awarding the tennis centre contract to Nicholson Construction . <p> " The tennis centre concept is very good , and I like tennis too , but I just do n't think we should be committing the next council to further borrowings or debt , " she said . <h> The accelerating erosion

 on US equities overnight was the energy sector , which lost 2% and pushed the S&amp;P 500 down 0.2% . Oil prices saw their biggest collapse in a month , after US EIA crude oil inventories surged above market expectations . WTI oil dropped 3.3% as oil imports surged to 8.9 million barrels per day . <p> The oil market is incredibly diversified , but major production regions around the world provide limited data on their production and inventories . Actually calculating global oil supply and demand balances requires a fair amount of educated guesswork . But the large presumed global oil inventories look to be starting to show up in the regular and high quality weekly US EIA data . Declining US shale production is more than being made up for by surging foreign imports . This is a necessary transition for the long term rebalancing of the global oil market , but it is unlikely to be met with relish by the oil spot price as the true extent of global inventories becomes clearer in the US EIA data . <p> After WTI oil 's big 3.3% drop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Greenback briefly rallies <p> The US dollar briefly rallied 0.2% overnight in the wake of the ADP employment numbers coming in slightly better than market expectations at 177,000 new jobs in August .

 ' from one-punch attack <p> VIC : Man jailed for six months after one-punch attack at a party caused serious head injuries . <p> File pic <p> A MAN will spend six months in jail for a one-punch attack at a Bendigo party that left the victim with a fractured skull and bleeding on the brain . <p> The victim spent several weeks in rehabilitation following what a judge described as a " strong punch that led to ongoing physical and psychological harm ' ' . <p> Karl Lecke , 33 , of Leopold , near Geelong , attempted to have the six-month sentenced overturned on appeal in the Bendigo County Court on Thursday , but a judge instead threatened to increase the jail time . <p> The appeal was then withdrawn , and Lecke who wept throughout the proceedings was taken into custody . <p> The court heard Lecke and the victim had attended a party in East Bendigo on October 10 with their partners . <p> They were drinking in a shed , when Lecke believed the victim had insulted his girlfriend . He pushed through people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . <p> suddenly punched the man to the side of the head , causing him to fall to the ground and hit his head on the asphalt . <p> The victim immediately lost consciousness and bled from the ear . He was taken to the Austin Hospital in Melbourne , then a further three days at Bendigo Hospital . The victim then spent two weeks in rehabilitation at the Anne Caudle Centre . <p> Defence counsel Anthony Isaacs said a jail term was excessive , as Lecke " had n't gone out randomly looking for violence " . " It was not random , gratuitous street violence , " he said . <p> But Judge Jane Patrick disagreed . <p> She said the courts have a responsibility to discourage violence . <p> " I do n't consider that he has fully accepted moral responsibility , " she said . <p> " He specifically went after the person who he thought had insulted his partner . <p> " It was a strong punch , that led to ongoing physical and psychological harm . <p> " One punch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the first police interview , Lecke said he " accidentally " knocked the man backwards expecting an attack , and then claimed the man had suffered an epileptic fit . <p> A victim impact statement from the victim and his wife was tendered to court , which outlined the ongoing physical and mental scars from the attack . <p> Mr Isaacs said community corrections orders could replace jail terms , and that jail " must be the last option " . <p> Judge Patrick said imprisonment was the only option , and the term would increase if the appeal continued . <p> was convicted and jailed for six months , to be followed by a 12-month community corrections order . <h> The decade-old desi

 Hawken expects the experience of 12 months ago to hold his side in good stead when the Bombers meet North Bendigo in Saturday 's Heathcote District Football-Netball League grand final . <p> It 's the second year in a row the Bombers and Bulldogs have met for the flag at Huntly 's Specialist Breeders Australia Oval . <p> Last year the Bulldogs won by 10 points in game where the Bombers were left to rue an inaccurate 1.7 in the final quarter as they were beaten 10.13 ( 73 ) to 8.15 ( 63 ) . <p> " I think especially for the younger players having last year behind them is going to be good for them in terms of the preparation and playing in front of the larger crowd , " Hawken said this week . <p> " We felt the game went to script pretty well last year , apart from poor kicking in the last quarter , but we feel this year we 're coming in with more depth and playing a really good brand of footy . " <p> It 's a brand of football that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average of 89 points . <p> " We feel like we 're in fairly good shape , " Hawken said . <p> " You 'd probably like a few closer games going into a finals series where you 've been challenged right to the end , but what has probably been a strength of ours has been our spread of goalkickers and the different players who can bob up and have an impact on the scoreboard . " <p> The Bombers who have a 15-2 record have averaged a spread of 9.1 goalkickers per game this season . <p> Matt Perri has bagged 77 , Ayden Walton ( 32 ) and Sam Kennedy ( 28 ) have also been key targets in attack for the Bombers , while star Tim Lincoln has kicked 33 off the wing . <p> The Bombers have also had Daniel Coates kick 35 goals , including eight in the final round against Elmore , but he has been ruled out with a hamstring injury suffered against Huntly in the second semi-final . <p> Down the other end the Bombers have conceded an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led by Kieran Treacy , Daniel , co-captain Hoby Bussey , assistant coach Ryan Prendergast and Steve Prettty . <p> " Our backline is very experienced and holds up really well under the heat of the battle , " Hawken said . <p> " Some of them like Treacy are a bit older , but they have held their speed well and are fairly uncompromising in that they do n't like getting a goal kicked on them . " <p> The Bombers who joined the from the Central Murray league in 2010 have steadily improved since they finished on the bottom of the ladder in 2012 with just one win . <p> Since their wooden-spoon season they have finished fifth , third and second , with an opportunity to go one better again on Saturday and win their first premiership since 1995 . <p> " It has been a good rise on the back of a really good group of juniors who have stayed with us , and the recruits we have added have been outstanding , " Hawken said . <p> The Bombers ' extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were part of last year 's losing grand final . <p> While the Bombers have proven themselves to be the side to beat on the back of their 15 wins in a row and top-of-the-ladder finish , the Bulldogs have done little wrong over the past two months . <p> The Bulldogs have won nine of their past 10 games , with the only blemish during that time a nine-point defeat to Huntly in the qualifying final . <p> North Bendigo 's impressive form followed a mid-season 47-point defeat to the Bombers that served as a timely wake-up call . <p> " We were pretty ordinary that day and as a group we spoke a lot about the areas that let us down and that gave us something to work on in the second half of the year , " North Bendigo coach Rob Bennett said . <p> " Probably the only time we 've let ourselves down since was in the first half of the qualifying final against Huntly . <p> CHEERING FROM THE SIDELINES : Hudson Alford will be cheering on his parents Ryan and Kristie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seniors and Kristie for the Bulldogs ' B grade netball team . Picture : DARREN HOWE <p> " The players know that if we 're not at 100 per cent on the weekend that your pants can be pulled down pretty quickly . " <p> The Bulldogs have won 16 of 19 games this season , with Bennett having the luxury of two of the star forwards of the competition at his disposal . <p> Sam Barnes ( 85 ) and Brady Herdman ( 79 ) have combined for 164 goals this year , with Barnes booting 10 in last week 's preliminary final win over Huntly . <p> " It 's not only their ability to hit the scoreboard , but it 's the work they do as well , " Bennett said . <p> " Brady said during the week it 's the best he has felt all year and is reaping the benefits of playing a finals series with no injuries after he had a broken thumb last year . They are both up and going .

We were tough and hard when we needed to be and I thought our first half in particular was outstanding kicking eight goals to three . " <p> Ruckman Lee Pollock ( two goals ) was named best for the Bombers for his standout game of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom German ( two goals ) and Adam Decicco also starred . <p> In defence the Bombers ' Dan held Sam Barnes goalless , and Ryan Prendergast kept Brady Herdman to one goal . <p> Matt Perri kicked four goals for the Bombers . <p> The Bulldogs ' score of 51 was their lowest since they were held to 4.7 ( 31 ) also against the Bombers in 2013 . <p> " We were beaten by a side that was willing to work harder than us ... they were well disciplined and well structured and worked for each other , " North Bendigo coach Rob Bennett said . <p> The Bulldogs ' best player was backman Alex Shipard . <p> " Our midfield did n't put any pressure on , so our backline was under siege a fair bit and Alex probably stopped another five or six goals getting kicked against us , " Bennett said . <p> Jarrod Findlay through the midfield and forward also worked hard for the Bulldogs , who had Sean Morris kick four of their seven goals . <h> Duchess of Cambridge 
 the Mildura woman who was promised funds was never revealed , but Mr Brennan said the funds would now go to Sunraysia Cancer Resources . <p> Colleagues and friends of the Bendigo woman told the Bendigo Advertiser they placed large sums of money in collection tins at their workplace , since collected by Mr Brennan , but none of those funds had made their way to her . <p> Businesses in Bendigo and Mildura are also owed thousands of dollars for their services in putting on two Night with the Stars fundraising events . <p> The Bendigo event was held at the Bridge Hotel , which is owed money by Mr Brennan . <p> The Mildura Football Netball Club , which operates the Mildura Function Centre , is still waiting on the payment of $4500 for the charity event that was held there almost six months ago .

West Australian gold has a particular look . You can pick it quite easily . <p> " It looked to me to be like a Victorian-type piece , and I can only say this from what I 've seen in pictures and on TV , but it looks like a piece from further west than the Tarnagulla region . <p> " I 've heard suppliers brag that since that story broke they 've sold every detector in their shop .

 environment - already beset by coral bleaching and kelp forest dieback - could face further pressures if the federal government acts on recommendations to wind back protection , green groups say . <p> The results of two lengthy panels set up by the Abbott government to review huge new marine reserves set up by then prime minister Julia Gillard in 2012 recommend changes to zoning use and boundaries for 26 of the 40 areas . <p> Michelle Grady , oceans director for the Pew environmental group in Australia , said the reports threaten to expose vulnerable areas to commercial fishing if the recommendations were accepted . <p> She urged the government to avoid winding back protection at a time of severe coral bleaching in much of the region 's coral reefs and widespread mangrove and kelp forest dieback in other marine areas . <p> Fiona Maxwell , a campaign manager for the Australian Marine Conservation Society , said the reports ignored the science and could trigger a devastating loss of threatened marine life . <p> " The Coral Sea is the cradle of the Great Barrier Reef , and one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giants like sharks , tuna and marlin remain , " Ms Maxwell said . <p> " It 's not only our unique marine life but our coastal communities , recreational fishers , and the valuable dive tourism sector who are the big losers in the Abbott Review report . " <p> Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said he had instructed the Director of National Parks to begin a consultation process to draw up new management plans for the reserves , to be finished by mid-2017 . <p> The federal government would consider extending protection to the Bremer Canyon off south-western WA as part of its response to the two studies . <p> Environmental groups have previously raised concerns the new management would permit greater access to fishing . The Abbott government in 2013 acted to eliminate exclusion zones in breeding areas and waters home to threatened species , which would have come into effect in July 2014 . <p> The marine parks reviews also come as the International Union for Conservation and Nature released a major study on ocean warming . <p> It noted oceans had taken up 93 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gases since the 1970s , creating " a cocktail of negative effects , which we are only just starting to understand " . The greatest ocean warming is happening in the southern hemisphere . <p> " Because of its size and distance from human habitation the ocean in the past has seemed like an almost limitless natural resource , including as a source of food , " the IUCN study said . " This is far from the truth as humanity has had a very major impact on all aspects of the ocean 's functional systems and the organisms living in it , from the smallest microbe to penguins and whales . " <h> Improving ' overall protection ' <p> The Australian reviews , though , said protection in the commonwealth reserves would be boosted by the suggested changes . <p> " As a package , the recommended changes will improve the representation and overall protection of conservation values , while providing access and continuity for a range of activities currently undertaken and proposed by commercial and recreational interests , " one of the two review reports said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all reefs to be zoned as sanctuary , marine national park or habitat protection , the total area recommended for protection as a marine national park is reduced . <p> Richard Kenchington , a professorial fellow at the Australian National Centre for Ocean Resources at the University of Wollongong , said the two reports appear to have " done a reasonable job " in balancing competing interests for the marine reserves . <p> The government should follow the authority 's lead and introduce five-year reviews of the outlook for each of the marine reserves , said Dr Kenchington , a former executive director of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority . <p> " This is the outlook of what will happen if we keep doing what we are doing , " he said . <p> Dr Kenchington also noted the report 's highlighting of the " infancy " of the state of knowledge , particularly for the efficacy of large pelagic reserves of greater than 100,000 square kilometres in size , as most of these large reserves had only recently been established . <p> Mr Frydenberg said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop management plans for the reserves . It will decide at a later date what industry assistance will be needed for fishing crews exiting the industry . <p> The Bremer Canyon would be considered for special protection , given its renowned large aggregations of marine life including , orcas , sperm whales , seals , sharks and giant squid , he said . <p> While protection of the canyon would be welcomed , the region between it and the coast is now subject to scallop dredging , a low-return , highly destructive practice that has no support from the local community , Ms Grady said .@@14213722 <h> OPINION : Can 
 do n't trump mother nature <p> Planned burns are largely ineffective in halting the spread of bushfires during the highest fire danger periods . <p> Newly released research has called into question the effectiveness of controlled burns in reducing the spread of fires which start during the highest fire danger periods . <p> The research paper , co-authored by the University of Melbourne 's Kevin Tolhurst AM and the Department of Environment , Land , Water and Planning 's Greg McCarthy AFSM , compared fire severity within a previously burnt area with that of an unburnt area nearby . <p> It found on severe , extreme or catastrophic ( code red ) fire danger days " even recent fuel reduction burns may not have much effect on reducing fire severity " . <p> " The most important finding was that the reduction in fire severity and suppression assistance effects of previous fuel-reduction burning started to decline substantially when the Forest Fire Danger Index exceeded 50 , " the paper reads . <p> " Above FFDI 50 , fires became ' ' and variations in fuel and topography became less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe fire danger days , the researchers found planned burns conducted within the preceding 10 years contributed a " significant proportion of the final fire boundary , confirming the importance of these areas to fire control " . <p> But Associate Professor Tolhurst said even on days when the FFDI exceeded 50 , planned burns would still aid firefighters during the cooler periods that followed . <p> " During the peak of the conditions the fuel reduction will have not much impact , whereas when conditions ease off , later in the evening or subsequent days , it 'll make a big difference to the ease of suppressing the fire as well as the extent of the fire , " he said . <p> And even when planned burns did not contribute to a reduction in the overall size of the fire , Associate Professor Tolhurst said they could have important environmental benefits . <p> " In 1985 at Maryborough , the box ironbark there which is not dissimilar to the Bendigo forest areas that had been fuel reduced along some of the major roads , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spread of the fire but it did provide important areas for animals to survive and find food after the fire because they were burnt less severely . <p> " They still had seeds and plants that could flower and provide food and some protection for birds and mammals and invertebrates in the area .

" <p> Despite 90 of the 97 submissions to the panel objecting to the proposal , Mr Cicero said it was " not a numbers game " , and the planning system was skewed in favour of objectors . <p> " How many people live in Maldon ? More than 97 . What about the thousands of people who did n't oppose this ? " he said . <p> " Unfortunately our planning system encourages people to object , when you get notice of an application for example , it says ' you may be affected by this proposal and you may want object ' , it does n't say ' there is a proposal that may be of interest to you , you may want to make some comments , whether for or against ' so of course you 're only going hear from the people who are opposed .

( And most are pre-occupied with bigger problems . ) <p> But for many , the show symbolises a bigger problem : modern TV drama is too dark . Too inky . Can someone please switch on a lamp ? <p> There is now a whole co-hort of under-lit American shows , as Kathryn VanArendonk writes in Vulture , including Mr Robot , a " murky " The Americans , and Halt and Catch Fire , set in " the darkest , gloomiest California imaginable " . <p> Here in sunny Australia , we 've followed suit . <p> High-brow thrillers such The Code on ABC opted for a grey , washed-out palette . But even our soapies have toned themselves down . <p> When Lynne McGranger blew into Summer Bay in 1993 , taking over the Home and Away role of Irene from Jacqui Phillips , she was a peroxide blonde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the diner Irene runs is lit with all the moodiness of a dive bar . <p> Over in Erinsborough , Neighbours producers have also ripped out the high-wattage bulbs . Even dramas such as House Husbands while not dark can seem muted at times . <p> All this is especially noticeable in contrast the reality genre , which prefers bright , bold colours . <p> Compared to more recent shows , The Sopranos might not strike you as dimly-lit . But , inspired by its success , others tried to replicate its look . " Dark " became synonymous with " quality " then everyone got carried away . Now , we need to close the curtains and squint when we watch Hannibal , True Detective or Marvel 's Daredevil . <p> In contrast , she says , the determination of Halt and Catch Fire producers to mute everything lends a " weirdly gloomy " feel to certain scenes , such as a family eating breakfast in what is meant to be a sunny breakfast nook . <p> Of course , dim lighting is n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as hand-held technology improved , film-makers went mad for the " " effect . Any script with a whiff of gritty realism had to look as though it was filmed in an earthquake . But for viewers , there 's a difference between " raw " camera work and needing motion sickness pills . <p> Technology has also been the biggest enabler of dark TV . <p> Indeed , the reason TV was so bright , for so many years , is because it needed to be . <p> Our old 20-inch cathode ray sets had a clarity intolerable to modern eyes . To make images seem sharper , producers filmed everything under bright lights . <p> It was safer that way , too . With digital cameras , a director can instantly review her work -- something that was impossible with film .

He hung overhead lights from catwalks , hiding the cables , and attached others to the cameras themselves . " The result was a show where everything was plainly illuminated , with very little shadow , and characters popped cleanly from the gray background thanks to backlighting , " Dessem explains . <p> Until the explosion in high-definition TVs a decade ago , there was little motivation to play with lighting : an under-lit scene would look invariably awful on analogue screens . <p> Of course , just because a scene appears dark , it does n't mean it was shot that way advances in post-production have also tinged our dramas . <p> Still , results vary . <p> Watching Game of Thrones on a 4K unit , in a darkened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on a plane , as your neighour 's reading light intrudes onto your screen .

 campaign begins on council mergers <p> It is no wonder worthy ideas to advance this state never come to fruition . <p> THE faint whiff of council amalgamations is back in the air over Victoria just weeks out from the local government elections . <p> Council mergers is one of those perennial issues , such as raising the GST , that is never far from the forefront of political discourse . <p> Why ? Well , there are two main reasons . <p> The first is that , in many instances , they make sense . There are a lot of budget-breaking inefficiencies , particularly among smaller councils , that can be solved -- or at least addressed through mergers . <p> Governments understand that , which is why they are reluctant to ever slam the door entirely on the notion . <p> However , it takes a particularly brave government with considerable political capital at its disposal to even contemplate adopting a policy . <p> Which brings us to the second reason why the issue of mergers is never far from the headlines : it makes for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the political spectrum they are positioned , love nothing more than stirring up fear over council amalgamations . <p> Earlier this week , the Minister for Local Government , Natalie Hutchins , gave the Coalition the opening it needed to seize on the issue . <p> When asked on radio she said the Andrews government would be " willing to talk down the track " about merging some councils . <p> She concluded her comments by saying " If there 's a big groundswell with people talking about this , happy to have the conversation " . <p> A reasonable interpretation of the minister 's comments would be that mergers are not a policy not even a priority but you never say never . <p> That 's not what the Coalition heard . <p> The opposition 's local government spokesman , David Davis , fired out a press release declaring , unequivocally , that the government was " embarking on a program to force local councils to amalgamate without community support " . <p> So , immediately the party that Jeff Kennett was at the helm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 78 -- later to become 79 had declared a new battleground . <p> Is it any wonder that so many worthy ideas to advance this state never come to fruition ?@@14280584 <h> Barcelona boss Luis

 tipped to snap back <p> The ASX is set to snap back from Monday 's sell-off after a much anticipated speech from a US Federal Reserve member helped calm fears of an imminent rate rise in the world 's most important economy and Wall Street rebounded from Friday 's rout . <p> Investors will also be focusing on a monthly dump of key Chinese economic data , although this is n't likely to rock sentiment too much , unless it is very weak .

The market is keen to see if the S&amp;P 500 can close Thursday 's gap .

Expect Asia to follow suit . <p> The trade of 2016 has been and remains doing the exact opposite of what feels right and this is what we will see today . <p> Moves lower in equity markets have been aggressive , but the internals on Monday ( I have looked at the percentage of companies above their 10- , 20- or 50-day moving averages ) were at levels where over the years this level of participation has marked key low points . <p> The question though is how traders act after the unwinding of the various markets and the pricing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen to ascertain whether traders use this strength to sell into , or whether we see a genuine belief that markets can push higher here .

Picture : NONI HYETT <p> Nick Stagg has three great passions in life family , friends and footy . <p> All three are indelibly linked with his beloved Sandhurst Football Netball Club . <p> You do n't have to watch Stagg play for long to know that he bleeds maroon and blue . <p> " During my childhood I was always around the club because my older brothers were playing with the Dragons , ' ' Stagg said . <p> " I 've had Sandhurst in my blood for my whole life . <p> " The friendship group is a big one for me . When I started playing under-18s I was playing with high school mates . Since I 've been playing seniors there 's been a core group of mates that just keep coming back to the club . <p> " I love every aspect of the club . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's the best place for me to play footy and I 'll be playing there for as long as I can . " <p> " I really want to win a flag for the cub .

" <p> Stagg gets a third opportunity to win a BFNL premiership when the Dragons tackle arch-rival Golden Square in the grand final at the Queen Elizabeth Oval on Saturday . <p> Unlike the previous two years , this time around the Dragons are warm favourites . <p> " The past two years we went about it the hard way and had to play in four finals , ' ' Stagg said . <p> " This year we had the luxury of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought it would be a bad thing for us to have a week off , but this year I realise just how much of an advantage it is . <p> " The body feels so much better and we have everyone fit and ready to go . <p> " Other years we had injuries and we did n't know if some players were going to play until the day of the game . <p> " We 're better off this year , but in saying that , hopefully , the result is different on Saturday . <p> " We have a massive task in front of us because we know we if we 're not on we could be in big strife .

I pride myself on the chase down tackles and the forward pressure . <p> " Being on the end of a couple of goals is always handy as well .

 dependency debate <p> What are the best ways to stop people becoming welfare dependent in Bendigo ? <p> ENSURING children have the best possible start to life is the most effective way to stop welfare dependency and inter-generational poverty later in life , Bendigo Community Health Services believes . <p> As the federal government sets its sights on welfare dependency with a $96 million package to come up with solutions , BCHS chief executive officer Kim Sykes said it was important not to place all welfare recipients in the same basket . <p> She said the Bendigo health services were already working to ensure the next generation did not grow up dependent on welfare . <p> " The reasons for needing to be on welfare - whether it is the disability support pension or Newstart - are very broad , and we should n't be quick to judge people , " Ms Sykes said . <p> " There is strong evidence to suggest people who are born into disadvantage will have much poorer outcomes for their lives . <p> " If you can intervene very early in someone 's life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce their risk of having poorer outcomes later on . " <p> A government-commissioned report identified parents under 18 , young carers and certain students as most at-risk from becoming dependent on government payments . <p> The report found young carers could go on to receive more than $500,000 in welfare throughout their lives . <p> The federal government will attempt to introduce a four-week wait for dole payments for " job ready " jobseekers , but it remains blocked by the parliament . <p> Ms Sykes said forcing people to go without welfare payments could be counter-productive . <p> " It creates a pretty unacceptable risk , " she said . <p> " We know there are many families who struggle week-to-week already , so if a person lost their job , I doubt they would have the resources to pay for four weeks . <p> " It would really have an effect on their dependents too .

It is currently $264 per week for single people with no children , and $286 for single parents . <p> Mr Porter said most people on welfare receive more than one type of payment , and most moved away from Newstart within six months . <p> " I would actually put to you that the fact that people who find it challenging to subsist off Newstart , do so for short periods of time , might actually speak to the fact that that 's one of the design points of the system that 's working OK because the encouragement is there to move off those payments quickly , " he said . <p> Member for Bendigo Lisa Chesters said people caught in the inter-generational unemployment trap was only a " small proportion " of those in Bendigo receiving Newstart or other welfare payments . <p> She said there needed to be jobs available for unemployed people in Bendigo , and reducing or stopping welfare was not the answer . <p> " There 's no use throwing money at not-for-profit groups to come up with their own solutions if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare , " she said . <p> " A high proportion of job seekers in Bendigo are over the age of 50 .

I do n't interpret that we 're favourites because when I walk out onto the ground on Saturday and look at the scoreboard , I see we 're zero zero each , " Primmer said . <p> " As far as I 'm concerned it 's an even game , and whichever side basically can play for the longer time of the four quarters will probably come out in front .

I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it delights me that so many people enjoy participating or simply watching a game . The flow-on effect of these activities benefits all our community . I do n't begrudge the next generation using these facilities , or the cost on the public purse . The costs associated with maintaining sporting facilities , for example , can not be funded by entrance fees alone , particularly with the number of sporting venues scattered around Bendigo , plus the about-to-be renovated tennis courts . <p> Do we close the library , Ulumbarra , the Capital Theatre and the Bendigo Art Gallery for good measure ? <p> I read letters from aspiring councillors who , if elected , appear hell-bent on arriving at council already mounted on their chariots , swords raised , enthusiastically promising to slash council extravagance on all manner of council funded activities . This is exactly where a measured , considered approach must be taken . <p> It is challenging for council with budget constraints to juggle the competing demands in a community . Councillors are always conscious of that concern , but the rewards must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported by council financially at least in part , and it proves to be a real plus for all Bendigonians . <p> So , please aspiring councillors , consider the ' bigger picture ' and how that impacts on the Bendigo community into the future .

I also hope that we , the Bendigo voters out there , listen very carefully to these aspiring councillors and think carefully whom we elect to office .@@14474476 <p> Rome 's new

" <p> The pacy Baird 's return has had a double benefit for the Bulldogs this year . <p> Not only has he returned to the club as a one-point player and been a driving force through the midfield , but he has also brought with him his Labrador premiership team-mate of last year , versatile key position player Chris Ryan , who was one of three Bulldogs to represent Victoria Country in July . <p> " It 's been great back at Golden Square this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Baird , who came equal fourth in the Michelsen Medal last Sunday night with 15 votes . <p> " I went up to the Gold Coast a couple of years ago as a wingman , but they threw me into the middle and I grew from there . <p> " I came back to Golden Square wanting to play more on-ball than out on the wing like I used to and I 've really enjoyed it . " <p> While there 's a fifth premiership medal beckoning for Baird who will play alongside his brother Travis he 's determined to ensure retiring superstar Simon Rosa gets a fitting send-off . <p> " He 's been a mentor to me and I 've always looked up to him , " Baird said . <p> " At three quarter-time last week ( when the Bulldogs trailed Eaglehawk by 16 points ) Jack ( Geary ) brought us in as a midfield group and said we do n't want this to be Rosa 's last game , and that definitely gave us a bit of an edge @ @ <h> Who 's who 
 priorities for Bendigo and surrounding towns ? <p> EDITORIAL : It 's important to have your say on the region 's priorities . <p> Change happens when people care . When communities mobilise to create a different way forward . <p> We know that in central Victoria some things do n't need to change . There are many reasons to love our little patch and that we live in a vibrant , regional city and surrounding towns surrounded by bushland with access to some great facilities and many opportunities is a privilege . <p> But we also know that across our region , there is a growing gap between those who can access those privileges , and those who can not . A regional partnership pulled together by the state government is asking the question : what are the priorities for our region ? <p> We know we need to find better ways to engage and work with young people . We need to give every child the best possible education , opportunity to find employment and chance to lead a healthy , independent rewarding life . <p> We know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes , businesses and schools is a priority . <p> In recent weeks , the Bendigo Advertiser has highlighted concerns by psychologists that they can not meet demand , nor can they attract practitioners to our city . How can we meet the needs of those living with poor mental health if we can not provide the appropriate support ? <p> But are these our greatest priorities ? That 's the question being asked of you . <p> As Loddon Campaspe Regional Partnership chair Nigel McGuckian says , we need to listen to the voices in our community and find common goals . <p> " For example , a council 's public space policy might only look at small parks and gardens in a town . But we should really be focusing on all of the public space , including forests , that might not be a part of a council strategy , " he says . <p> " We know we have serious areas of disadvantage compared to Melbourne , in terms of unemployment and health disadvantage . This is about finding new ways to address these problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's what the community wants us to turn into priorities . " <p> It 's easy to be cynical of what some could say is a government-driven talkfest . It 's also easy to sit back and do nothing . But if you do n't have your say , your voice will never be heard . It may well be the issue you identify is the one that changes our region 's future . Everything is on the table .@@14511467 <h> Benjamin Law <p>

 unprecedented assisted dying laws <p> Unprecedented dying with dignity laws could pass the Victorian Parliament with support growing across all sides of politics for assisted dying legislation . <p> Earlier this month Health Minister Jill Hennessy declared her support for some sort of assisted dying regime , prompting a cascade of ministers to also affirm their backing for the practice . <p> Ms Hennessy is leading the government 's response to a ground-breaking multi-party inquiry that recommended Victoria adopt assisted dying laws . <p> A Fairfax Media survey of MPs from all sides of politics has found there is likely to be enough support for assisted dying legislation , as long as the laws were robust and clearly defined with sufficient protection from abuse . <p> Earlier this month Premier Daniel Andrews , without throwing his full support behind voluntary euthanasia , declared that the state was failing dying Victorians . <p> " We are failing as a community , " he said .

 wish list is the easy part ... <p> You might think Infrastructure Victoria has done the heavy lifting , having delivered more than 1000 draft pages outlining a $100 billion plan ( of sorts ) to keep Victoria liveable for the next three decades . <p> It calls for new roads ( several of them ) , a network-wide road pricing regime , an airport rail link , greater investment in social and affordable housing , and urban infill making better use of existing infrastructure . Among other things . <p> As far as aspirational wish-lists go , this is a solid start . <p> But as is often the case with infrastructure , coming up with ideas about how to spend money is relatively simple . The diabolically difficult part will be managing the politics , including working out how to pay for it all . <p> Delivering a new system of road pricing is a case in point . For decades , boffins have been talking up the concept of variable transport charges that would fluctuate depending on things such as location , distance travelled , the time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckons the technology is probably now advanced enough to actually introduce an sophisticated pricing model where roads are just part of the " ecosystem " in a broader transport network . <p> It has even set up two " citizen 's juries " , both of which have concluded a comprehensive system of transport pricing should be introduced . <p> The theory may be sound , but ask most people in politics and they 'll likely tell you it would take a brave government indeed to ask motorists to pay to drive on roads that are currently free . The political challenge here is not insurmountable , but it would require a level of courage and artfulness that has been strikingly absent in recent years . <p> Working out how to pay for this will also be a challenge . <p> As it is , the Andrews Government has a crowded infrastructure agenda , including eliminating 50 level crossings , building the $10.9 billion Metro Rail Tunnel , building the $5.5 billion Western Distributor tollway and upgrading the Monash and Tullamarine Freeways . <p> The Government has some headroom here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Melbourne for a $9.7 billion . <p> The port windfall will initially be used to pay back the state 's net debt . But down the track , as the 2018 state election looms , this will in turn give the government more headway to borrow for future projects . <p> The politics of another big tollway could also be difficult to manage , particularly if it involves another windfall for a private operator , as the Western Distributor project does for Transurban . Already , Infrastructure Victoria 's agenda is heavy on road projects , including the North East Link and the a new outer metropolitan ring road . <p> The Andrews Government now has until the end of the year to respond to Infrastructure Victoria 's recommendations . <p> Chances are , the North East Link will be placed on the list as another road priority for Melbourne ahead of the next election . But how the Government goes with Infrastructure Victoria 's other 133 recommendations is anyone 's guess . @ @ @ @ @

I 've been the victim of very dry stage presentations and it is my feeling as an audience member that I start paying attention whenever a panel discussion or a gets off the subject . <p> " Then suddenly you go , oh , you feel like you 're in the moment , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So , I will try to do that in Sydney . " <p> The second element of Groening 's appearance will be shared with his friend cartoonist Lynda Barry , whom he met at college . A brief history : Groening heard about a girl who had written a letter to Catch 22 author Joseph Heller , writing " Ingrid Bergman " on the back of the envelope hoping to bolster her chances of a reply . <p> " Inside she wrote , I 'm not really Ingrid Bergman , I 'm Lynda Barry and I 'm a fan of yours , will you marry me ? " Groening reveals , chuckling . " And Joseph Heller wrote back , saying , it 's a very flattering offer but I do n't think there 's room enough for the both of us in your dorm room . It was really sweet . " <p> Groening and Barry became immediate friends and lived large on the campus of Evergreen State College in Olympia , Washington . " No grades , no required courses , " recalls Groening . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both hippies ourselves , but even back then people were easily offended . " <p> After college , Groening moved to Los Angeles hoping to become a writer , taking a job on The Los Angeles Reader , which later published his comic strip Life in Hell . In 1985 , he met producer Jim Brooks who , having seen Life in Hell , proposed Groening animate a series of shorts for The Tracey Ullman Show . <p> Inauspiciously perhaps , and with jagged lines and still uncertain voices , the Simpsons -- Homer , wife Marge and kids Bart , Lisa and Maggie were born . The names of Bart 's parents and sisters were , like much of The Simpsons , borrowed from Groening 's own life . <p> In 1989 , they migrated from shorts into their own half-hour series and a bona fide cultural phenomenon was born . <p> " At first it was just refreshing because it took a very conventional format of low budget television cartoons and it was a little smarter and a little quicker than usual , " Groening says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " great writers and great actors , great animators and great musicians " which elevated the show . <p> " We took the template of a family animated sitcom and we used it as a forum for all kinds of jokes , so there 's parodies and slap stick and sophisticated literary references and musical numbers and homages to other forms of animation and politics and religion and everything . " <p> Delving into the more complex aspects of the show 's humour , or its social commentary , is a risky proposition . As with most expressions of art , the more you unpick the knots , the greater the chance it will unravel before your eyes . <p> " Comedy is very hard to analyse without killing it , " Groening says . " That 's a big fear of a lot of people who work with humour , but I feel though , if you can analyse humour and comedy and jokes , you may destroy some of your unconscious anxieties that drive you to do certain kinds of jokes . " <p> For Groening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dirty Joke , written by Gershon Legman and published in 1968 . <p> " Basically the author says all humour is based on hostility , " Groening says . " It 's very Freudian . And then Legman admits , given he has spent his entire life collecting dirty jokes and that humour is all based on hostility , that yes , he 's a very angry guy . I thought that was great self-analysis . " <p> For the record , Groening does n't agree wholeheartedly . " I do n't think I believe that all humour is based on hostility , though a lot of it is , " he says . <p> In its infancy The Simpsons was seen as counter-cultural , even controversial . Here was this family whose father , Homer , was overweight and lazy , and whose son , Bart , was disrespectful , even uncouth , gasped the social commentariat . Never mind that the family solved problems co-operatively and that , without fail , they were in church together every Sunday . <p> In many respects the show 's counter-cultural sensibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was an exciting time to be in school because film , music , movies , there was just a revolution of styles and people were pushing stuff , pushing the extremes and reinventing themselves , " he says . <p> Inspired by the " great experiment " of the 1960s , he found himself frustrated by the blandness of American television . " I thought , if I had a show , I would have a kid who is really bad on the show , instead of what passed for bad , which I thought was very namby-pamby , " he says . <p> More than 25 years later -- with almost 600 episodes , one motion picture , 31 Emmy Awards , one Peabody Award and the word " D'oh ! " ( Homer 's " annoyed grunt " ) now officially in the dictionary the series has not just shaken off its counter-cultural roots , but it has clawed its way to the very heart of the mainstream . <p> Groening declares he is baffled by both how constricted television used to be , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's too much good stuff . When I was a kid there was hardly anything . " <p> In comparison , he observes , The Simpsons " is relatively conventional these days , compared with the explosion in cable television cartoons . " <p> Broadly , however , satire and parody are fighting a slow war of attrition with the increasing absurdity of the real world . Case in point : the US election , which has television satirists working overtime . <p> " The Simpsons is so much dealing with caricature and exaggeration ; it is very hard to exaggerate the caricature that is reality , " Groening says . " Specifically , this election . But we try . " <p> He is a fan of HBO 's John Oliver . " There are brilliant American social satires and political satires , " he says . " My guess is , what little I know about Australian politics , it seems like it 's just as crazy , it 's just as much polarisation . " <p> So , he has done some pre-departure research ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vs . Australia ? <p> " I decided I should become acquainted with some aspects of Australia that I do n't know , " he says , revealing an impressive shopping list of Australian literature : My Brilliant Career by Miles Franklin , The Fatal Shore by Robert Hughes and The Harp of the South by Ruth Park . <p> " Oh my gosh , it 's fantastic , " he says of the last of those , which he is presently part-way through . " I got the sequel Poor Man 's Orange too . I got this beat up , used copy of both books with somebody else 's name in them , but it 's so good . " <p> With no firm itinerary outside of his appearance at Graphic , Groening says he is simply looking forward to meeting the fans . The art of that interaction , he offers , lies in finding something unique to share with them . <p> And , he adds , never , ever correcting them on detail , even if they have spelled the name of a character incorrectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I ask him that ever happened ? <p> " One of the very first fans I met , had my Life in Hell rabbit on his arm and it said , Blinky , " Groening says . He pauses for effect . " His name is Binky . And I did n't say anything . " <p> In fact , Groening reveals , his fans have historically displayed a disturbing tendency towards indelible ink . " I once ran into a fan in Baltimore , at a museum , and he said , can you sign my arm ? And I did but I said , do n't get this made into a tattoo , " he recalls . <p> " And then he said he was going to do just that , so I said , you 've been drinking , I want you to sleep on it , just do n't do it tonight , " Groening adds . " And an hour later he came back , his arm bloody , and declared , I did it . " <p> Matt Groening 's solo talk for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November for is sold out .

 for glory as premiership droughts linger <p> A look at the region 's longest flag droughts in the wake of the Western Bulldogs triumph last weekend . <p> ASK any Western Bulldogs ' supporter and no doubt they 'll say the wait was worth it . <p> MEMORIES : John Gregory and Bill Moss were members of Pyramid Hill 's 1950 premiership team . The Bulldogs have n't won another flag since . <p> After 62 years without reaching the pinnacle of success , the Bulldogs last weekend ended what had been the most enduring VFL-AFL premiership drought when they beat Sydney to win their first flag since 1954 . <p> That now leaves Melbourne ( 1964 ) with what 's now the competition 's longest premiership drought . <p> While the Bulldogs are finally basking in premiership glory , there are plenty of clubs throughout this region who are enduring lengthy flag droughts . <p> Here 's a look at the longest current top grade flag droughts in the region that encompass the Bendigo , Heathcote District , Loddon Valley , North Central and District football leagues , Bendigo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years -- Huntly ( ) : a bit confusing this one given Huntly 's history in that it was formed as a stand-alone club in 1893 , has been in recess several times and in 1986 merged with Provincial , so should Provincial 's 1965 Golden City league flag be counted ? <p> But the last time a team known as Huntly won a senior premiership was 1940 in the Bendigo District Football Association when it beat Bridgewater by 35 points , 17.23 ( 125 ) to 13.12 ( 90 ) , in what was a competition that also included CYMS , Kamarooka , Kangaroo Flat , Kennington , Long Gully , Neilborough and that year . <p> 66 years -- Pyramid Hill ( LVFL ) : a much-publicised premiership drought that the Bulldogs just ca n't break , despite constantly getting themselves to the pointy end of the ladder in the LVFL . <p> The Bulldogs have n't missed a finals series since 2003 and through those past 13 seasons have made at least the preliminary final nine times and played off in three grand finals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win against Mitiamo by five points , coached by Harry Henderson , remains the last piece of senior Bulldogs ' senior silverware . <p> " The 1950 grand final will not pass to the archives for its high standard of play , but will long be remembered by present generation Pyramidians as the hardest-earned premiership within living memory , " was how the Pyramid Hill Advertiser described the 8.8 ( 56 ) to 7.9 ( 51 ) victory the last grand final win for what 's now more than 1000 games for the Bulldogs . <p> 63 years -- Campbells Creek ( ) : in 1953 Perc Perry coached the Magpies to the premiership with a 15-point win over Carisbrook . <p> Since then Carisbrook has gone on to win 11 more flags , while Perry remains the last coach of a winning Magpies ' grand final team . <p> The Magpies have had three other cracks at winning a flag since their 1953 triumph , but were beaten in 1958 , 1971 and 1972 . <p> 47 years -- Dunolly ( ) : between 1956 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning five flags . <p> After a five-year absence the Eagles returned to grand final day and beat Newstead by six points to capture the 1969 premiership . <p> However , since the glory years of the ' 50s and ' 60s the Eagles have been unable to add to their premiership tally after 1969 , with their drought now getting up towards half-a-century . <p> They had their most recent premiership chance in 2009 when they succumbed to the team they beat in 1969 -- Newstead by nine points . <p> 37 years -- Sandhurst ( BDCA ) : the Dragons are the owners of what 's the BDCA 's longest current premiership drought . <p> In 1979 the Dragons captured the second of back-to-back flags with a 147 run win over Eaglehawk , in which Barry Ayres who passed away earlier this year made 76 , while Robert Court combined 61 with the bat and 4-41 with the ball . <p> Sandhurst has n't made a grand final since . In fact , the Dragons have only played finals in five of the ensuing 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bushy 's sixth flag since 1972 , but also the last time the club has stepped onto the premiership dais . <p> Royal Park has lost four grand finals since , with its last appearance on the big stage a debacle in 1993 when destroyed by Newstead by 88 points . <p> 30 years -- Inglewood ( LVFL ) : unlike the on-field struggles the Blues have endured for the past decade , there was a time back in the ' 80s when they were a force . <p> Between 1984 and 1987 the Blues played in four-straight LVFL grand finals and won 55 of 76 games . <p> Of those four grand finals , the Blues saluted in just one the 1986 decider against Bridgewater by 25 points . <p> Daryl Canty coached that flag . Thirty years and 501 games on Canty still carries the mantle as Inglewood 's last premiership coach . <p> 28 years -- White Hills ( ) : the Demons ' sole flag since they joined the in 1984 came in their fifth season when they were the 1988 premiers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three flags in a row , by 22 points . They have since played 462 games and only got back to grand final day in 2004 and 2005 for a pair of losses . <p> 27 years -- Marong ( LVFL ) : there 's just one LVFL premiership cup in the Panthers ' trophy cabinet , won in 1989 when Ian Hando coached the club to an 80-point grand final thrashing of . <p> The only time in the 466 games since that glorious day in ' 89 that the Panthers have played off for the flag was the 2004 grand final loss to Calivil United . <p> 25 years -- North Bendigo , now Epsom ( BDCA ) : the name North Bendigo no longer features in the BDCA , but the history of the club is tied to Huntly as it 's now known . <p> The Power was formed in 2001-02 out of a merger between the North Bendigo senior and Huntly junior cricket clubs . <p> Before the merger North Bendigo won its last flag in 1991 which was celebrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied Eaglehawk a sixth-straight premiership with a 24-run win . <p> Captained by Kieran Byrne , 1991 was also a drought-breaker for the Bulldogs , with it their first flag since 1973 . <p> 25 years -- Rovers ( ) : Maryborough derbies do n't come any bigger than the 1991 grand final when Rovers took on cross-town rivals Royal Park . <p> In a low-scoring game in which just 13 goals were kicked Rovers prevailed by 30 points . <p> Another 435 games have passed for Rovers without another flag to add to 1991 . <p> 24 years -- Lexton ( ) : won its last premiership in 1992 when competing in the former Lexton Football League . <p> 23 years -- White Hills ( BDCA ) : captained by Max Taylor , the Demons defeated Golden Square by six wickets , spearheaded by a bag of 7-52 from Steve Rixon to capture the 1993 BDCA premiership in what was the second of two in a row . The Demons have n't made a grand final since . <p> 22 years -- South Bendigo ( BBD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BDCA ) and Trentham ( ) all claimed premierships in 1994 and have n't won since . <p> Complete premiership lists for the Emu Valley Cricket Association , plus netball competitions unable to be sourced .

 The one trait needed to become a Victoria 's Secret model <p> The most important trait needed to model in the annual Victoria 's Secret fashion show is ... personality . <p> So says the new face of Seafolly , Bridget Malcolm , 24 , from Perth , who made her debut for the lingerie brand on the world-famous runway last year . <p> Possibly not the first attribute that would spring to mind for many of the estimated 10 million audience who tuned in last year from across the globe to watch the much-hyped catwalk show , but the South Fremantle native insisted when speaking to Fairfax Media this week at Bondi Icebergs : " It 's about personality as much as it is body . <p> " Obviously all of the girls look amazing , but it 's not about just rocking up and being in shape . You have to really be a girl who can be on camera and really represent the brand and have a great time . <p> " They need to know that you are going to be able to perform because you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lights and cameras and you have to be able to get up there and do a good job . " <p> She laughed as she acknowledged that the notion sounded a little left field : " It 's something you would n't think about . " <p> Victoria 's Secret is a career goal for many , and can catapult a model from oblivion to instant notoriety by putting them front and centre of a whole new audience and , most importantly , new modelling contract opportunities . <p> But despite starring last year alongside the likes of Melbourne 's Shanina Shaik , Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid , a spot in the final line-up is never guaranteed , and Malcolm is getting herself ready to go through the lengthy audition process at the end of October ahead of the November show . <p> " There is no way of knowing . I am on-hold for it ... Fingers crossed . It would be such an honour to walk for them again . But even just to do it once was great , " she said . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know . I want to say ' yes ' . " <p> She was left disappointed in 2014 when she did n't get a call back : " There was a year I thought I got it and I had n't . I was in shape , but they are after personality , " she explained . " I do n't want to get too attached to it , it 's easier with this job not to get too attached . " <p> She auditioned again in 2015 with an altered mindset : " I said to myself , ' I am going to go in and I am going to make them laugh . I am going to have fun and I am going to try and enjoy it . I 've known all of the judges for years . I have worked with them . It is not scary . ' I kept telling myself that anyway . I was petrified , but it worked because I was able to relax and talk to them like people . " <p> Malcolm cocked her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of her material for this year 's casting call . She could n't because she needs to keep it for the casting directors , so instead parted with her mental preparation . <p> " I picture myself in that room a lot and I picture myself walking up to them , " she said . " I picture myself looking at them in the eye and just talking to them and being happy . <p> " When the time comes I have already been there and I have already lived it and it 's less daunting . " <p> Despite the intrigue surrounding Victoria 's Secret , Malcolm says she has ticked off her biggest career achievement of 2016 becoming the face of Australian swimwear brand , Seafolly . <p> " I have been eying Seafolly for years . I remember seeing Miranda Kerr and Jess Hart and all of these amazing models on their covers , so when they asked my agency if I was free , I said ' yes , yes ' , " Malcolm said . <p> But would landing the coveted Victoria 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seafolly off the top spot of her accomplishments ? <p> " No , " she laughed . " Victoria 's Secret was my goal for last year . Being Australian I grew up wanting Seafolly . <p> " Victoria 's Secret was n't on my radar until I moved to New York and I realised what a big deal it was and then it was . But Seafolly will always be really close to my heart because it is a part of my identity . <p> " It 's like Australia 's version of Victoria 's Secret , " she said . <p> Despite stripping back to her smalls for both campaigns , Malcolm said there is different preparation involved for both . <p> " The Seafolly girl is athletic , she 's sexy , she 's a massive beach babe . I eat really clean and work out hard all year around , so my body , I hope , is reflective of that , " she said . <p> Leading up to the shoot earlier this year in WA 's Broome , that she described as having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she kept a close eye on her intake : " I just made sure I drank lots of water and did n't have too many sweets or salts and got lots of sleep . " <p> However , the Victoria 's Secret fashion show is a totally different ballgame , where models need to look look more toned and svelte for walking shots on television : " They are after a different type of aesthetic , so that 's a lot more working out . More muscles , and a cleaner diet . But it 's a short period of time and it 's sacrifice I am willing to make . " <p> Another highlight this year for Malcolm was marrying her partner of two years , Walking Shapes musician , Nathaniel Hoho , in a low-key ceremony at his home in Pennsylvania in July . <p> Wearing a custom Australian designed , she described it as one of the best days of her life , and is even considering doing it all over again at Christmas when her in-laws head Down Under for a trip to Rottnest Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are having a party . I do n't want another big , big wedding , " she said , explaining that she might have her brother " ordained " after he did such a successful job of emceeing her wedding . <p> " Being married is the best feeling . It is really lovely . I feel like everything is settled . I feel very calm and very safe . I found my soulmate . I am the happiest person in the world , " she said . <p> The Hohos ( she has taken his name , but not professionally ) live together New York , but as the old adage goes , you can take the girl out of Perth but you can never take the Perth out of the girl . <p> " Sometimes I feel a bit like a caged animal . After a more than a couple of weeks there I am starting to go a bit crazy and I try figure out a away to get out . That is why I will jump on any job in Australia , " she laughed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room and Malcolm is beside herself with excitment , but despite the broodiness swears babies are off the cards for at least five years . <p> " My agent in New York was like : ' promise me five years at least ? ' I am 24 , I am young I will give her that , " she said . <p> But getting married at a relatively young age never really crossed her mind . <p> " Since I met Nathaniel and started dating him , it is hard to describe , it was just a wave of warmth . Life with him is just right and it was the biggest feeling of done deal - this is it . Since we got married that feeling has only intensified , " she said . <p> Next stop for Malcolm is Peru , after that she plans to focus on writing more , and learning how to say " no " .@@14748473 <h> A NSW dispensary 
 Spirit in season-opener against Adelaide Lightning <p> It took overtime for the Bendigo Spirit to defeat the Adelaide Lightning in their WNBL season-opener . <p> Heather Oliver starred for the Bendigo Spirit on Saturday night . <p> AT first glance a 14-point victory for the Bendigo Bank Spirit over the Adelaide Lightning may appear a comfortable WNBL season-opening result . <p> But it was anything but for the Spirit at the Bendigo Stadium on Saturday night . <p> While the Spirit won 77-63 , they were forced into overtime by the Lightning , who had led the match earlier by as many as 14 points . <p> However , after a scrappy performance for much of the night typical of a round one game , it seemed the Spirit needed the scare of overtime to jolt into action against a team tipped to be one of this season 's battlers . <p> The Spirit destroyed the Lightning in overtime , outscoring Adelaide 16-2 , with Bendigo 's Kerryn Harrington the player who took hold of the game by the scruff of the neck in the extra five minutes . <p> Harrington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play of the final quarter after Adelaide 's Colleen Planeta had hit a two-point jump shot to tie the scores at 61 with 8.2 seconds left . <p> Harrington transitioned the ball from the back court and drove to the basket , but her lay-up under pressure did n't score , sending the game into overtime . <p> Harrington then wasted little time in putting the Spirit on the path to victory , scoring the opening six points of overtime inside the first 32 seconds . <p> First she nailed a three-pointer , then she scored a two off a steal and was fouled , adding another point and from there , the Spirit never looked back as they won their opening game of the season for the first time since 2012-13 . <p> After scoring just three points in 26 minutes throughout the first four quarters , Harrington added eight in overtime . <p> The only points the Spirit allowed the Lightning in overtime were two free throws to captain Lauren Hodges . <p> The Spirit shot an ordinary 9-of-17 from the free-throw line at one stage they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> Inside the last 21 seconds with Bendigo ahead by one point , Kelsey Griffin missed two free throws and Nayo Raincock-Ekunwe went 1-of-2 , with those three missed opportunities costing the Spirit the chance for some late breathing space . <p> Earlier , the Spirit trailed in the first quarter by 14 points after the Lightning unleashed a 14-0 run after scores had been level at 7-all . <p> By half-time the Spirit had pegged their deficit back to one point , and at three quarter-time led by three , before a game which had to that stage been petering along sprung to life in the final term . <p> The Lightning scored the first eight points of the final quarter to lead by five , the Spirit hit back with a 9-2 run to lead by two , before the two sides traded baskets over the last four minutes in what was a gripping finish . <p> Heather Oliver was superb off the bench to be the Spirit 's best player . <p> The tenacious Oliver combined 15 points with four rebounds , two assists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered a double-double on debut with 16 points including the Spirit 's first seven of the match and 11 rebounds . <p> Superstar Griffin had a quiet night offensively with just 10 points the first not coming until halfway through the second quarter but she did haul down nine rebounds and dish out a game-high five assists . <h> SUBSCRIBE FREE TO

Picture : NONI HYETT <p> Is it an essential part of Eaglehawk 's heritage which must be preserved or an eyesore which has fallen beyond repair ? <p> That is the question Bendigo councillors will be asked to decide tomorrow night and at stake is both the future of a run-down , 140-year-old miner 's cottage and that of its pensioner owner . <p> City of Greater Bendigo heritage officers have advised councillors to reject the application to demolish the Hall Street property . <p> City statutory planner Lachlan Forsyth 's report to councillors argues demolition of the original weatherboard cottage would be " unacceptable " under council 's heritage policies . <p> The report cites historic records which indicate the cottage was constructed circa 1876/77 making it the oldest building in the street . <p> Real estate agent Craig Tweed says the property will sell for up to $30,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house which stands next to the Railway Station Hotel forms a " critical " part of a heritage precinct . <p> " The house is highly visible from the Eaglehawk Railway Precinct and , together with the three houses from similar date on the opposite side of the hotel , is important in helping to establish the historic character of the Peg Leg and Railway precincts , " the report reads . <p> Despite the heritage report , Craig Tweed the real estate agent representing the applicant said common sense dictated the house should go . <p> " I love old buildings , that 's what Bendigo is built on , " Mr Tweed said . <p> " And I respect and appreciate the fact that there has got to be reports done and every attempt made at keeping old buildings ... to a certain extent . <p> " But there has got to be common sense prevail about the condition of a building when it comes to a decision about whether it can be removed or not . <p> " With this building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't be kept . " <p> The real estate agent said the property had been on the market since February , with the asking price set at between $135,000 and $145,000 . <p> He said his client , who is in aged care , stood to lose up to $30,000 if the permit was not approved . <p> " Even seasoned renovators have looked at this place and said they wo n't touch it , " Mr Tweed said . <p> " We 're dealing with a pensioner 's livelihood here , and I 've had to advice him that if this application is knocked back , he 's going to have to knock the price down by $20,000 to $30,000 . <p> " So sure we 've got to preserve the heritage of the city , but we 've also got to look to the future , to look at the positives of what could be done if it was a vacant block and a nice home was built .

 that no one ever comes up with an absolute finding on what happened to Harold Holt Bushwhacked <p> Wayne Oct 2016 , 9 a.m . <p> Next year will be the 50th anniversary of Harold Holt 's mysterious disappearance . The mystery has brought so much to the Australian language . <p> I really hope that no one ever comes up with an absolute finding on what happened to Harold Holt . <p> The Australian language and sense of humour would be poorer for it . <p> For those who came in late , Harold Holt spent 32 years in the Australian Parliament and was the Australian Prime Minister when he disappeared while swimming at Cheviot Beach , near Portsea , on December 17 , 1967 . <p> No trace of him was ever found . Next year will be the 50th anniversary of his mysterious disappearance . The Holt mystery has brought so much to the Australian language . <p> I thought I 'd heard it all until this past week or so . <p> It started the other weekend when the Cronulla Sharks won the rugby league grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winning stage , one of the Sharks ' executives announced it was time to " turn the porch lights off . " <p> Huh ? What porch lights ? Why had they been on ? <p> The explanation was n't given for days until one news presenter referenced the line and then explained it came from a pithy saying about the Sharks ' hopes of ever winning a final . <p> It was said that hoping for a Sharks ' grand final was like leaving the porch light on for Harold Holt . It was never going to happen . <p> This was almost as amusing as naming the Glen Iris swimming pool the Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Centre . <p> But there 's even more to the way Harold Holt contributes to Australian happiness . <p> I was talking about the " porch lights " comment to an old journo at a community newspapers conference in Bendigo last week and he passed on a story I 'd not heard . <p> He said that as light failed on Cheviot Beach on that fateful December night , ABC radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He was asked if the search would continue through the night and he replied , no , it would n't because of poor conditions , and that , in fact , it had " come to a dead halt . " <p> Pause for stunned OMG moment . <p> Even now , you 'll often come across comic references to Chinese submarines , an allusion to the oddball conspiracy theory that he 'd been picked up at sea by the Chinese . No one ever seems to quite explain why . <p> There 's also a conspiracy that the Americans did him in because there was a concern he was about to back away from Australia 's commitment to the war in Vietnam . There 's even a weird webpage in Australia by an alleged former Navy clearance diver who said he 'd carted poor Harold 's lifeless body to a waiting fishing vessel . <p> Although , it must be noted the same bloke claims someone has implanted an odd electronic device in his throat to apparently prevent him from spilling the beans . Which begs the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the phrase " doing a Harold " , rhyming slang for " doing a bolt " , for example , fleeing a restaurant without paying the bill . <p> Beyond the Aussie irreverent humour , he 's well-honoured . There is a Canberra suburb named after him . There 's the Harold E. Holt naval communication station . The division of Holt in federal politics bears his name . As does a sundial in Fitzroy , a boarders ' wing at Wesley College , and an American Navy warship the first US ship to be named after a foreign leader . <p> And in the circumstances , we can not imagine how this one had gone unremarked before : he is remembered in a large area at the south of Port Phillip Bay the Harold Holt Fisheries Reserve . <h> BYO liquor ban

 emotional plea for better understanding and acceptance of people with autism during a public hearing in Bendigo on Monday . <p> The hearing was one of several being held across the state by the state parliament 's family and development committee as part of its inquiry into services for people with autism spectrum disorder . <p> Susanna and Martin Flanagan told the committee , chaired by Bendigo West MP Maree Edwards , of the financial , emotional and mental costs a lack of proper support and understanding had had on them and their three children , the whole family having been diagnosed with autism . <p> They said when their middle child began school they struggled with a lack of support and an unwillingness to make adjustments to cater to their child 's needs , which had such a detrimental impact on the wellbeing of that child they decided to have their children educated at home . <p> The need for better training for teachers was one of the major issues raised by Murray Dawson-Smith , chief executive officer of disability service provider Distinctive Options . <p> Mr Dawson-Smith called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with children with autism as part of their education , as well as school principals to be formally assessed on their inclusiveness of students with autism . <p> He said education was an area in which the state government , as an employer of teachers , had an opportunity to add value to the National Disability Insurance Scheme . <p> The capacity of the NDIS to meet the needs of people with autism was another concern raised by Mr Dawson-Smith . <p> He said the number of people with autism who would seek support from the NDIS had been " grossly underestimated " when it was launched . <p> Several other speakers also attended the hearing , including representatives from Bendigo Autistic Advocacy and Support Service and the Macedon Ranges Autism Network . <p> During the inquiry , the parliamentary committee will consider the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder in Victoria , the availability and adequacy of services provided by all levels of government , the adequacy of services to be provided under the NDIS , and the projected demand for services . <h> Sydney : Family

Bouris recently told CBD 's sister paper , The Australian Financial Review , that he will fire himself this financial year if the company he founded , Yellow Brick Road , does not make a profit . <p> And while TZ also does not make a profit , Bouris pointed to its strong revenue growth as a sign that things are heading in the right direction . <p> In the letter to shareholders that accompanied TZ 's annual report , Bouris argued TZ 's " tough upbringing ... will keep it in good stead in the future " . CBD is unclear whether that was a reference to the group 's $186 million in accumulated losses . <p> " We are in far better shape than the market gives us credit for and I continue to be optimistic about our future , " Bouris said . <h> Bad dreams <p> " There 's an old saying that the market is always right , " says former fund manager Ross , who reckons he 's going to prove this old saying wrong one more time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgiven for wondering if -- or when the bad dream will end . <p> First there was the $100 million bid for Andean Resources , the owner of a promising gold prospect in Latin America , which was finally bought for more than $3.6 billion .

 2016 will forever be remembered as a dark day for Bendigo and the people both old and young with disabilities living within its boundaries . <p> For more than six decades Radius has kept some of this community 's most vulnerable residents out of institutions by providing them with love , care and opportunity . <p> As a result of this service and the dedication of its employees , countless people have been able to live independent and fulfilling lives , free to realise their full potential . <p> The shocking announcement by the board yesterday afternoon that Radius is no longer financially viable is the most bitter of blows to Bendigo . <p> A society is judged on how it treats its most vulnerable citizens and for a long time Radius Disability Services has been a shining example to us all . <p> Largely reliant on government money , the organisation invested heavily in social enterprises -- most notably its flagship Morley 's Emporium to supplement this funding . <p> But despite the tireless efforts of so many people , it was not enough and in the board 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Radius chairman Russell Robertson said yesterday the decision was made after " new information " came to light amid an investigation conducted by new CEO Alyson Miller . <p> No further details have yet been forthcoming , but it is an ominous statement that needs to be elaborated on . <p> The decision plunges the futures of its 133 supported employees , 102 day service clients and 78 general employees into doubt . <p> While administrators have pledged there will be no changes to care arrangements in the " immediate term " , meeting the particular needs of its clients must be paramount . <p> As the vicious , unprovoked assault on the School student yesterday so sadly and starkly demonstrates , even in a community as traditionally caring as Bendigo it is not an easy life for people with disabilities . <p> Now , more than ever before , it is incumbent upon us all to assist these vulnerable people through a difficult transition . <h> Venezuela probes reports

 noted one or two kids at school who dropped their Gs and lobbed in a passing K by way of compensation . <p> To tell the truth , I used to think ( with a K ) that they were people who would have trouble looking at a Disney comic without chaffing their lips . <p> I always used to tell my kids to be careful when they opened their mouths , as they were revealing more than just a couple of thousand dollars in dental work . When we speak , we pass on so much more than just words . <p> We inform people where we come from , our ease with the English language , our levels of education ( to a degree ... excuse the pun ) and our ability to understand spelling , to use correct pronunciation and acceptable sentence construction . We can also demonstrate our sense of humour , an ability to muck about with words creatively and whether we are interesting people or quite boring . <p> I used to tell them that it 'd be much more difficult , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : gowan ? Watcher lookin for ? Like . Dude . <p> A waiter who answered a query about the best plate of the day with : " Du n no . good " would certainly get a tip get another job and quickly . <p> So it used to be with the word-ending K. Surely a marker of someone who just was n't paying attention in year seven English . Akin to those who dropped their Gs entirely and were doin nothin about anythin at all . <p> But not now , dear reader . I have to inform you that hardly a day goes past without noting this phenomenon in all walks of life . You see quite smart and presentable people being interviewed on TV yabbering on about anythink at all , or nothink at all , and not being remotely embarrassed about it . <p> For reasons I can not now remember , I like watching Parliamentary Question Time on the ABC and this past week I heard one of our elected MPs not even slightly a silly person waxing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To me it was like a shotgun blast at 10 centimetres . To the MP , it was quite normal . <p> An ABC news presenter used it this week . Where did this come from and why is it spreading into usually more erudite parts of our community ? <p> It seems the replacement of a silent G with a spoken K is -- at this stage more strongly noted in Australia , New Zealand and some south-eastern parts of the UK . But I can not find many suggested reasons . <p> One language website thought it might be that some people do pronounce the G , so that " nothing " becomes " nothinG " . It has appeared also in some eastern US regions where they would pronounce Long Island as " Lawn Guyland " , and " singer " would rhyme with " finger " . The way we form this hard G is very close to the way we form the K sound , and it is thought that some of those using the stray K do n't even hear it . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always shifting , and it 's likely that plonking a K on the end of an -- ing word will one day be so common it will be acceptable . But I 'll be in my grave by then .

 the season to explore Spring Gully DOMAIN <p> 22 Oct 2016 , 9 a.m . <p> Domain : Sue Opie from Luke Goggin Real Estate guides you through her new neighbourhood . <p> While Bendigo 's streetscapes have all developed over time , those in Spring Gully have seen significant changes , from an outer district that supported gold mining activities with its population of 342 ( according to 1911 Census figures ) , to a vibrant neighbourhood of close to 3000 people . <p> One of those is Luke Goggin Real Estate 's property sales consultant Sue Opie , who recently made the move to the Bendigo suburb . <p> SPRING GULLY STYLE : Architecture in the Bendigo suburb spans designs from the past 50 years , with the majority of gardens landscaped to blend in with the natural bush environment . <p> " I moved to Spring Gully from an inner city dwelling and was worried how I would adapt , " she says . " But the highlight of living in Spring Gully is that five minutes from the CBD I can drive home and find kangaroos in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Park and Spring Gully Reservoir , Spring Gully has a well respected primary school and preschool , excellent sporting facilities and walking tracks . <p> A short drive from the Strath Village Shopping Centre , which includes Woolworths and Aldi , it also has excellent dining and entertainment options such as the Spring Gully General Store and recently renovated One Tree Hill Hotel . <p> Sue notes that the demographic of people currently living in Spring Gully is split right down the middle . " Fifty per cent are families and 50 per cent are single , with the average age being between 40 and 59 , " she says . <p> " Because of its close proximity to La Trobe University , it does attract a lot of students , but it also presents a great lifestyle option for families , singles and retirees alike . " <p> Last century Spring Gully was a tiny town with a hall , store , hotel and primary school ( which opened in 1906 ) , and the postcode remained a small centre until development began in the early 1970s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains Sue . " There is not one style , but rather a representation of all types of homes within the past 50 years . The majority of homes in Spring Gully have been landscaped to blend in with the natural bush environment as much as possible . " <p> According to Sue , Spring Gully has properties available at all entry points in the market , from units and townhouses , to family homes and million dollar properties . Currently , 74 per cent of these are either owned or mortgaged . <p> " The median price of a three bedroom home in Spring Gully is currently $336,000 , in comparison to Golden Square , which is $295,000 , " she says . " In comparison to five years ago , the median sales price for a three bedroom house has increased 14 per cent , which gives it an annual growth rate of 2.7 per cent . <p> " A comparable suburb would be Golden Square which has seen an annual growth rate of 2.1 per cent .

 jail for man who bashed , chased council inspectors over shed dispute <p> Adam Cooper24 Oct 2016 , 5:29 p.m . <p> Running for their lives through dense bush , nursing head injuries and pursued by an attacker they believed was armed was not what a pair of council inspectors had been expecting when they 'd turned up at a rural property to look at some sheds . <h> 11 ? years jail for man who bashed , chased council inspectors over shed dispute <p> Running for their lives through dense bush , nursing head injuries and pursued by an attacker they believed was armed was not what a pair of council inspectors had been expecting when they 'd turned up at a rural property to look at some sheds . <p> When the men 's assailant , Jonas Black , eventually came across one of the South Gippsland Shire inspectors , Justin Eades , he told him : " You know I was going to kill you back there . " <p> And the grave , Black 's trial was told , had already been dug . <p> On Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , to serve at least 7 ? , after a Supreme Court jury in June found him guilty of two counts of attempted murder and one of attempting to pervert the course of justice . <p> In May last year , Black invited council inspector Matthew Patterson to visit his rural property in Turtons Creek , north of Foster , to check sheds which , he had been told , breached planning permit laws . <p> But after a dispute almost two years long , Mr Patterson felt uneasy following the phone call and asked Mr Eades to accompany him to the property its owner had dubbed " " . <p> Unbeknown to the officers , Black had developed a brooding hostility towards Mr Patterson , felt he was being unfairly targeted and wanted retribution . <p> Fuelled by insomnia and days of alcohol abuse , he effected a plan to murder the inspector , including buying lime and digging a grave in nearby bushland . <p> That Monday morning , while the two inspectors checked inside one of the sheds , Black took a piece of scaffolding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Eades to the head , and Mr Patterson to the head and ribs . He then told them the only way they would escape was by killing him . <p> Mr Patterson took a nearby shovel and hit Black , and the resultant struggle allowed Mr Eades to escape , despite nursing a fractured skull . <p> Mr Patterson whose injuries were less serious than his colleague 's fled through blackberries to raise the alarm , and Black got in his car to search for the pair . <p> He found Mr Eades , but at least assisted the injured man and gave him water . <p> As he awaited the police to arrive , the court heard , Black rang his fiancee and mother to admit to a " foolish thing " . Then he drank some wine . <p> Supreme Court Justice Jane Dixon said she was satisfied Black had planned to attack Mr Patterson , and that his intention was to kill . <p> She could not be satisfied he harboured the same view towards Mr Eades , as he had never met him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were simply doing their job in a cowardly manner . <p> She said the prosecution 's description of Black 's plan as an " absolutely crazy and irrational scheme " was apt . <p> Mr Eades ' injuries were so severe he lost his sense of taste and smell , experiences ongoing fatigue and anger , is in constant pain and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression . <p> He is unlikely to work in his role again . <p> Mr Patterson is back at work and welcomed the sentence , but admitted the ordeal had been on his mind during other property inspections . <p> In his 20 years as a council inspector and building surveyor , he had in recent years noticed an increase in hostility towards his role . <p> " I think there 's more risks , definitely , " he said . <p> " I 'm not too sure what it is , but there 's no doubt that people have a sense of entitlement whereas previously , in our role , people might have had a bit more respect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the street and they get a ticket , you can call them every name under the sun and that 's considered normal . It is changing , unfortunately . " <p> Municipal Association of Victoria chief executive Rob Spence agreed council workers were now more likely to be abused and attacked , a societal shift he attributed to reduced respect towards authorities . <p> Mr Spence said councils had changed policies to ensure frontline staff were safe in combative environments , which meant parking officers and building inspectors were deployed in pairs , while police regularly accompanied council officers who visited homes to remove restricted dogs . <p> Councils had also better trained their staff to deal with different cultural and poorer communities . <p> " It was diabolical , " Mr Spence said of the Gippsland attack . <p> " Just to treat anyone like that is bad enough , but especially for those people who were merely doing their job . People really get very worked up about some issues . " <p> Black has never apologised to his victims and maintained he never dug the grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called his girlfriend and urged her to destroy a pair of his boots , which had soil on them that matched the grave site . <p> Before his sentence , he told Justice Dixon he doubted whether prison was conducive to his rehabilitation given the " proximity of violent inmates and sexual predators " . <p> Justice Dixon said it was clear prison had been confronting for Black , but she had to denounce his crimes of the strongest of terms . <h> INDUSTRY OPINION : 
 ' significant bushfire season ' <p> Central Victoria has been identified as an area at particular risk from bushfires this summer . <p> Ross Upfield douses flames near his friend 's house with water near Three Chain Road in Lancefield in October last year . Picture : JUSTIN McMANUS <p> Victorians have been warned to expect a " significant bushfire season " , fuelled by substantial growth in grass and other vegetation after recent heavy rains . <p> The fire risk is expected to be highest in January and February after fuel dries off and temperatures rise , and emergency authorities have urged Victorians to be ready for the fires that will inevitably occur . <p> Central and western Victoria , including well-populated areas , have been identified as areas at particular risk this summer . <p> " The key issue for Victoria is central and western Victoria , where the grasslands meet the bush and where the grasslands meet communities , " Emergency Management Commissioner Craig Lapsley said on Monday , at the launch of Fire Action Week . <p> " One of the key things this year is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prepared to do it again , because the regrowth could be significant . So , do the work in late October/early November , but be prepared to revisit it to make sure you are ready for our summer , " he said . <p> Mr Lapsley said the aircraft fleet of 48 was " very practical , very responsive , but one of the best fleets that we 'll see across the world . " <p> Deputy Premier and Emergency Services Minister James Merlino said the state could expect " an above average fire season " despite the recent floods and drenching rains . <p> " I know it 's been raining , I know it 's wet , but that means growth . And growth means fire danger - so we need to start thinking about the upcoming fire season right now , " he said . <p> He urged people to take " practical steps " around their homes and communities now , well before the fire season and its hot , windy weather arrived . <p> " Get rid of the dry grass , get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around your home , clean your gutters , cut down those overhanging branches . Do those practical things around your home that will make a difference , if there is a fire in your community , " he said . <p> Mr Merlino said he visited the Cobram area over the weekend to inspect flood damage , where he was told by the local CFA they were ready for a significant bushfire season . <p> " A lot of water means that with a few weeks of dryness and heat , there will be extraordinary growth and the high risk of particularly grass fires in the summer season ahead , " Mr Merlino said . <p> Environment Minister Lily D'Ambrosio reminded people living on the rural/urban fringe to be ready for the fire season . <p> " With the wet weather we will see growth of grass . And we know that with fire that is started in grasses , that it moves actually very rapidly and very quickly . And in particular for the urban interface areas , it is particularly important to be vigilant this coming summer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're heading into an above-average fire risk season , " she said . <p> By this time last year , fire had already devastated small communities near Lancefield , destroying four homes . <p> Finance Minister Bill 
 gun control laws must never be eroded <p> Australia 's strict gun control laws need to be closely guarded from vested interests . <p> Senator Bridget McKenzie <p> THE decision by then prime minister John Howard to tighten gun laws in the aftermath of the Port Arthur massacre in 1996 ranks among the best and boldest in Australian political history . <p> From the moment news of the mass shooting started filtering through to a shocked nation on that fateful Sunday afternoon , Mr Howard was turning his thoughts to toughening firearm laws . <p> Flushed with political capital after a landslide election victory that delivered a 45-seat majority just weeks earlier , Mr Howard stood firm despite opposition from some key Nationals colleagues . <p> The outrage from recreational shooters and some farmers was even more vociferous and after receiving death threats , he famously donned a bullet-proof vest at a rally in Sale . It was a choice that Mr Howard would later regret , but it is instructive as to the level of hostility towards gun control that existed at the time even in the wake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Firearms Agreement , which included a gun buy-back scheme that saw one million guns purchased and destroyed , is that for 20 years Australia 's gun laws have been the envy of the world . <p> As body after body drops in the United States , pro-gun control politicians , academics and commentators frequently point to Australia as a example to which to aspire . <p> Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics analysed by international news agency Reuters indicate this country is a substantially safer place following the the gun reforms . <p> Reuters found the chances of being murdered by a gun in Australia declined 72 per cent from 0.54 per 100,000 people in 1996 to 0.15 per 100,000 people in 2014 . <p> If that evidence is not compelling enough , in 1996 there were 311 murders in Australia of which 98 were with guns . <p> Despite a considerably larger population by 2014 , the number of murders fell to 238 , with just 35 committed with firearms . <p> Any attempt to erode this country 's gun laws , as we have witnessed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no compelling reason why a weapon such as the lever-action Adler A110 shotgun , which is capable of firing up to eight rounds in eight seconds , should be imported into this country . <h> Post Your Comments 
 are more than just marketing tools <p> There is enough pressure on VCE students without them being used as marketing tools . <p> There is enough pressure on VCE students at this time of the year without them being used as marketing tools by their schools . <p> It is unfair on these students that during one of the most stressful times in their young lives their ATAR exam results may be used by their schools to gain a marketing edge . <p> Now schools are being put on notice ... those that leak ATAR results will be slugged with tough new penalties . <p> The new penalties follow a series of breaches over top secret VCE results . <p> School principals have been put on notice that if they break the rules they will be barred from accessing ATAR results ahead of students for up to five years . <p> The breach will also be reported to the Australian Privacy Commissioner . <p> Victoria is the only state that releases ATARs to school career counsellors a day before they are distributed to students , allowing schools to plan support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped and those who received better than expected results . <p> Support , yes . Gaining a marketing advantage , no . <p> These students are young , impressionable people who do n't deserve to be placed under any more pressure from their schools , which are supposed to be there to nurture them , teach them and guide them into the next phase of their lives . <p> These students are not a number and they are not a tool to be used by some greedy schools looking for the upper hand when it comes to attracting funding or prospective future students . <p> But by using the early release of ATAR results to promote their schools they are breaching an embargo and privacy laws . <p> The privacy of students and their families should be first and foremost at the minds of schools , not the fact that better ATAR scores could result in improved marketing . <p> It is extraordinary some lengths schools will go for that competitive edge .

Balancing the experience of visitors with environmental considerations is one of the challenges identified in a vision paper looking at the future of the precinct . <p> PEOPLE are invited to comment on a vision paper exploring the future of one of Victoria 's best-loved landmarks . <p> The vision paper is the first step in the development of a new master plan for the Hanging Rock precinct by the state government and Macedon Ranges Shire Council . <p> The paper says the most prominent issues relate to human impact and " retaining the intrinsic values of Hanging Rock " . <p> It identifies several challenges regarding management of the precinct , including visitor experience and funding and resourcing , but also highlights opportunities arising from these . <p> Three years after 
 announced that the Australian Law Reform Commission will investigate the Indigenous incarceration crisis , which Attorney-General George Brandis has described as a " national tragedy " . <p> Senator Brandis and Indigenous Affairs Minister Nigel Scullion said on Thursday the government would refer an inquiry on alarmingly high incarceration rates to the commission , which will consider possible reforms . <p> " The degree of civilisation in any society can , among other things , be judged by looking at the condition of its prisons , " Senator Brandis said in Melbourne . " It is a sad reflection on Australia that our first peoples are so grossly over-represented in our nation 's prisons . " <p> Since the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody in 1991 , the proportion of Indigenous Australians in the prison population has risen from 14 per cent to 27 per cent . <p> Senator Brandis said failed , flawed or incomplete reform efforts in that time had shown " little in the way of tangible progress . Indeed as those statistics reveal we have gone backwards . <p> " It is clear that after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal of public discussion and immense public good will ... many of the disturbing trends upon which the royal commission shone a light persist . " <p> The announcement has received a mixed response , with Labor and the Change the Record coalition acknowledging the opportunity , but arguing it was n't a complete solution . The Greens said they were " astonished " by the announcement of another inquiry . <p> Change the Record , a coalition of advocacy groups focused on Indigenous incarceration , welcomed the opportunity of the inquiry but said the broader context should be addressed by federal , state and territory governments in a Council of Australian Governments process . <p> " This just ca n't be a review from the Law Reform Commission ; there needs to be a broader COAG process to address the drivers of this , " co-chair Shane Duffy said , agreeing with concerns that there had already been plenty of inquiries into this issue . <p> " We know that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander imprisonment rates , and experience of violence , are strongly linked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a focus on early intervention , prevention and diversion programs . " <p> Opposition Leader Bill Shorten expressed support for the new inquiry into " unacceptable " incarceration rates , but said the problem was already well identified by lawyers and Aboriginal communities . <p> " We need more non-custodial sentences to help deal with a range of the issues , " Mr Shorten said . " The answer ca n't be : You are an 18-year-old Aboriginal man in Australia , you are more likely to go to jail than university . We need to be better than that . " <p> Indigenous teenagers are 24 times more likely to be incarcerated than their non-Indigenous peers , and Indigenous women are 30 times more likely to be in prison than non-Indigenous women . <p> Labor 's policy is that justice targets be included in the Closing the Gap framework , which seeks to address Indigenous disadvantage in health , education and employment . <p> Greens senator Rachel Siewert said : " We have known what we need to do for over 25 years now . The royal commission into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which have not been implemented . <p> " It really is quite astounding that successive governments have basically sat and watched Aboriginal deaths in custody and incarceration grow for 25 years . " <p> The Australian Law Reform Commission has not handled an inquiry dealing specifically with Indigenous incarceration since its report on Aboriginal customary laws in 1986 . <p> The new inquiry 's terms of reference will be formulated in consultation with Indigenous Australians . <p> Senator Brandis said the federal government would work with states and territories primarily responsible for criminal law and policing to better help Indigenous prisoners get jobs once released from jail to reduce the risk of reoffending . <p> The Law Council of Australia welcomed the law reform commission 's investigation as a " significant development " and an opportunity to " devise concerted policy solutions to address this urgent and ongoing crisis " . <p> The announcement follows the Turnbull government 's establishment of a royal commission into abuse of children in the Northern Territory corrections system , following an ABC investigation that revealed boys being tear-gassed and strapped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darwin . <h> Melbourne Bishop Criticises 
 population prompts call for alternative forms of justice <p> A blow-out in Victoria 's prison population in the last ten years is reason to consider other responses to crime , Bendigo 's community legal centre has said . <p> A Sentencing Advisory Council report released yesterday found more than 6200 people were incarcerated in Victorian jails today , up from 4000 in 2005 . <p> The increase is largely because of a 150 per cent jump in people being refused bail , particularly those accused of violent offences . Unsentenced prisoners now make up almost one-third of all those behind bars . <p> The council 's chairman , professor Arie Frieberg , said this was in keeping with community expectations that those alleged to have committed violent crimes not be granted bail . <p> But Loddon Campaspe Community Legal Centre practice manager Clare Sauro said focus needed to shift away from prison sentences and on to forms of early intervention that " prevent people from entering jails in the first place " . <p> " is concerned about the high and rising levels of incarceration , which will only rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . <p> " Considering the cost of imprisoning an adult is over $350 per day , we need to think whether this investment is worth it , " Ms Sauro said . <p> Addressing the underlying causes of crime was what Ms Sauro believed would ultimately make the community safer . <p> The council 's report also found the number of female and indigenous people in prison rose at a higher rate than their male and non-Aboriginal peers , while the type of crimes for which people were jailed had changed as well . <p> Property crimes were the main reason people were imprisoned in 2005 , but most inmates today were jailed for offences against other members of the community . <p> In the City of Greater Bendigo , these offences , which include assault , robbery and sexual offences , have increased steadily year on year since 2012 , data from the Crime Statistics Agency shows . <p> A MAN whose 
 insurance costs up to 150 per cent more <p> Add-on travel insurance offered by Qantas , Virgin and Jetstar can cost up to 150 per cent more than standalone policies offered by providers and even the airlines themselves . <p> In a review of 30-day worldwide travel insurance policies sold as part of a flight booking process on all three airlines , consumer group Choice found a family of four would save between $445 and $871 by purchasing a standalone policy instead of that offered by an airline . <p> The review argued that airline add-on insurance policies commonly calculated the price based on every traveller , including children , leading to higher premiums . <p> " The airlines are being very sneaky by charging adult prices for kids who can be insured for next to nothing if you purchase standalone policies directly through an insurer , " said Choice head of media Tom Godfrey . <p> The Choice review compared add-on insurance policies offered by each airline , with standalone policies offered by the airlines ' own underwriter . <p> In one example it found that a family of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insurance Premium Cover , underwritten by AIG , will face charges of $848 . <p> For an equivalent policy offered by Good2Go The Works , also underwritten by AIG , the same family would pay just $362 . <p> Mr Godfrey said the 134 per cent price premium was " a long way from being a good deal " . <p> " If you 're booking an overseas flight ... leave the boxes in the online checkout unticked and purchase a policy directly from an insurer . " <p> However a Jetstar spokesman said Choice was " being selective with the comparisons they have drawn " . <p> " Customers have the option to select AIG travel insurance through the Jetstar booking process ... or they can choose to book insurance elsewhere . " <p> Jetstar 's travel insurance policies start from $10 per person , with the rate varying according to baggage and destination . <p> Virgin Australia offers add-on insurance for a family of four at a cost of $890 , however an almost identical policy sold separately on the Virgin Australia website costs half the price at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for two adults and two children travelling to Europe costs $511 less than the policies offered as an add-on in conjunction with a Virgin flight . <p> The only Virgin add-on insurance policies that present a better deal are those for travellers over the age of 65 and 70 , which are cheaper by 3 and 12 per cent respectively . <p> A Virgin Australia spokesman said all coverage offered by its provider , CoverMore , was offered to customers on international flights on an " opt in " basis and with a 14-day cooling-off period . <p> " Due to technical limitations , this is currently quoted per seat . We are working with our partners to find a way for the system to distinguish between adult and child bookings , " she said . <p> " While we offer travel insurance during the booking process and on our website for our customers ' convenience , we encourage customers to shop around and find the best policy to suit them . " <p> The biggest price increase identified was that of the Qantas Comprehensive add-on insurance , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same provider , QBE . <p> For a 30-day trip to the US , two adults and two children would pay $1448 , as Qantas charges children 12 years and over as adults . <p> The fee is a sharp increase on an equivalent offer from the same provider for $577 , which allows anyone under 25 years to travel free . <p> A Qantas spokesman said its Comprehensive insurance provides additional levels of cover for cancellation , luggage and personal effects . <p> " Customers aged 12 and above who are flying with Qantas are required to purchase adult fares ... if they choose to purchase the travel insurance directly through us . However , this policy is being updated to include dependents up to 25 years of age as part of family cover . " <p> A pair of

 for tough WNBL battle against University of Canberra Capitals <p> KIERAN Nov 2016 , 10 a.m . <p> A new-look Canberra will pose some challenges for the top-of-the-ladder Bendigo Spirit . <p> ALL-ROUND THREAT : Kelsey Griffin leads the Spirit in assists and ranks second in scoring and rebounds . <p> BENDIGO Bank Spirit will be out to validate their red-hot form of last weekend when they host University of Canberra Capitals on Saturday night . <p> The Spirit ( 4-2 ) have leapt to the top of the WNBL ladder after consecutive road victories against second-placed Dandenong and reigning champions Townsville . <p> Coach Simon Pritchard has implored his players to not undo last week 's great work against a new-look Capitals , led by Olympian Marianna Tolo and American Mikaela Ruef . <p> " Rather than consolidate , we are using the word validate , " he said . <p> " We need to validate the work we did last week by getting a win this week . <p> " That in turn validates the effort we put in on the road .

 out after cop dad 's suicide <p> NSW : Maddison and Taylah McQuade are calling for better support for police officers after their dad took his own life . <p> Sisters Maddison and Taylah McQuade with a picture of their father Leigh McQuade who recently committed suicide . Picture : Georgia Matts <p> Leigh McQuade had no trouble staring down the hardest of criminals and never thought twice about throwing himself in the line of fire . <p> His police academy training supplied him with the tools necessary to bring down the toughest of crooks and soothe the hearts of the most broken victims . <p> But no one taught Senior Constable McQuade how to tackle the black dog that terrorised him . The wild beast that has brought down far too many NSW cops , got him too . <p> Maddison and Taylah McQuade are now left wondering why no one could help their dad the brave Illawarra cop who took his own life , aged 43 . <p> ' ' When dad began to get sick , I was quite young so I was n't entirely aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learnt what the basics were ... his anxiety affected the daily things that he used to be able to do so carefreely , ' ' Maddison said . <p> ' ' It was n't until after his death that I actually researched what PTSD actually entails , and it just blew me away to believe how an individual can suffer so much .

There could be so much more support . ' ' <p> As the McQuade family struggles to move on without Leigh , they still feel the support is lacklustre . <p> ' ' Even now we have n't been provided much help , we were assisted with NSW Police Association counselling with only three appointments and as I 've been going through my HSC they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I need privileges , ' ' Maddison said . <p> ' ' It was horrible , all the stuffing around and telling stories to people who claimed they were there to help but never did .

' ' First responders , whether police , firefighters or paramedics , see things and deal with trauma that is almost unthinkable for most of us , and it happens to them on a daily basis ' ' . <p> " For police in particular the lack of organisational support while they are in the force is then magnified by the complete absence of support once a psychologically injured officer leaves the force , ' ' Mr Shoebridge said .

 a Melbourne woman who was killed while travelling in Africa has been told she was raped and murdered after becoming separated from her tour group . <p> Elly Warren , from Mordialloc , was killed in Mozambique on Wednesday while on a diving trip . <p> Her distraught family believe the 20-year-old 's body was found in a toilet block . <p> Elly was due to return to Australia on Monday , before travelling to New Zealand with her boyfriend on Friday . <p> Between tears , Ms Warren 's mother Nicole Cafarella told Fairfax Media that Elly was " just one of those girls that wanted to travel the world and see everything she could before she was 30 " . <p> She said her daughter was travelling in Africa alone . It 's believed she was part of a diving group , hoping to fulfil her lifelong dream of swimming with whales . <p> In a Facebook post , Elly 's sister Kristy Warren , said her mother had got a call to say Elly had been killed . <p> " My sister was in Africa when my mum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her daughter has been murdered , as I heard that my heart dropped , " she said . <p> " It is a parents ' nightmare to get a phone call like this . <p> " Elly was always ambitious and had so many goals to go travelling but maybe she had too many . <p> " I want to say if you are thinking of going travelling or going overseas please be careful aboutwho you go with .

Up to 2000 sellers of old bits and pieces from vehicles long since gone to God and , lots of err , stuff . <p> We recall a few years back talking to two old mates who had a huge trailer loaded with wheels , rusted panels and a fair few kilograms of iron oxide . They came from southern New South Wales and confessed they nearly always went home with as much stuff as they 'd sold . <p> " When I get home , my wife gives me a bit of an ear-bashing for not having sold a thing . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff back and forth between home and Bendigo . " <p> +++ <p> DTM was browsing The Age online when we came across the story of former minister Steve Herbert resigning from his post over using a chauffeur-driven , taxpayer-funded car to shuttle his beloved pups , Ted and Patch , between Melbourne and Trentham . But the article was n't the thing that caught the eye . Right alongside the item was an advertisement : " Dogs belong in the home . " And probably not in the House ? <p> +++ <p> There are lessons hidden in many strange places . Many regular readers would be aware that DTM had a feeble attempt at running for Greater Bendigo council and that youngest daughter , Lizzie , is a coloratura soprano with the Victoria Opera . <p> VO last weekend performed its Pied Piper at the Capital Theatre , and Liz had the starring role of teacher Rosemary Sprig who exposes the greedy mayor for corruption and ripping off the public by failing to pay the Piper to get rid of Hamelin 's rats . <p> The Piper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as payback for the mayor 's thieving ways . Somehow , teacher Sprig talks the Piper into bringing the kids back and he , in turn sacks the mayor and his mangy mob and appoints Sprig mayor . <p> This was all quite humorous until , at the end , we noted outgoing mayor Rod Fyffe two rows back . A friend later quipped to both DTM and Rod that the lesson in the performance was this : " If you want to be mayor , it 's simple , get rid of the rats . " <p> William said Remembrance 
 pre-sale inspections DOMAIN <p> Domain : Protect and maximise the sale of your property by engaging a pre-sale property inspector to examine your home . <p> Do you want the ultimate vendor advantage when selling your property ? <p> According to Rod Poyser from Central Victoria 's Rod Poyser Inspections , " just as you would n't buy a car without a roadworthy check , the same applies for a professional inspection of your property before putting it to the competitive property market " . <p> Although some properties are sold in a " as is " condition , it can be more beneficial in terms of time and sales outcome , if hidden issues can be easily rectified prior to listing your property . <p> Potential purchasers are often adverse to even minor maintenance issues , which can be seen as a hassle after the long-awaited dream home purchase . <p> HEALTH CHECK : Rod Poyser recommends home owners discover hidden issues to protect and maximise their asset by engaging a pre-sale property inspector to examine and discuss the house before it goes to sale . <p> Spotting defects during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious deterrent for potential purchasers if they have to organise an electrician or plumber to address issues in their newly purchased home .

 makes sense <p> Opening clearances for football clubs in November a move that makes sense . <p> THE new AFL Victoria initiative to allow the clearance window to open for the month of November appears a commonsense move in the current climate of local footy . <p> List management is a term more commonly associated with AFL clubs , but it 's now more pertinent than ever under AFL Victoria 's Community Club Sustainability Program . <p> That 's a program that this year introduced the state-wide player points system , and will next season be coupled with the salary cap , with both designed to reduce player movement and the " inflationary nature of player payments " . <p> And that means clubs need to be able to plan ahead for the coming season with some certainty as early as possible to fit within the constraints of both their points allocation and the salary cap . <p> The clearance window being open from November 1 to 30 for the first time allows clubs the opportunity to do that as they will now be able to officially get players on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until February 1 when clearances have traditionally opened . <p> With the February 1 clearance opening date , a club could sign a player back in October , yet has to wait four months for the chance to officially register them . <p> But that 's four months in which a player can re-think their decision and when it comes time to officially commit and lodge the clearance in February , they backflip and pull out , leaving the club in the lurch . <p> A player may have signed a contract to join a new club , but ca n't officially become that club 's player until cleared . <p> There 's also the chance come February that once a clearance has been lodged for a player there 's an issue at his previous club , such as owing money or is under contract , whereby a clearance wrangle then ensues and a player can be left in limbo as the season approaches . <p> Yet with the clearance window open for November , it presents the chance for clubs to be able to deal with such issues early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations like the drawn out South saga earlier this year that dragged into May . <p> Sure , clearance issues will still arise when they re-open again at February 1 , but at least clubs have been given the early chance to get a leg-up in their list management through this November period . <h> Australia rolled for 
 honoured with AFL Victoria awards <p> CHERIE O'NEILL has thanked the Bendigo Thunder for showing faith in her after she was named AFL Victoria 's Female Coach of the Year on Friday night . <p> And the Bendigo Umpires Association was also recognised at AFL Victoria 's community football awards night by winning the Umpire Group of the Year . <p> O'Neill says she was shocked to receive the Peta Searle Female Coach of the Year . <p> " I 'm still pinching myself and did n't see it coming . I was just happy to make the final four and to just be there on the night was fantastic ... I never thought I 'd win it , " O'Neill said on Saturday . <p> O'Neill took on the Thunder coaching role earlier this year in challenging circumstances after the departure of previous coach Craig Riddiford a week out from the start of the season . <p> She was n't officially appointed until four rounds into the season , galvanising the group and leading the Thunder into the VWFL premier division grand final against Deer Park . <p> The Thunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up short in the battle for the flag , going down by 13 points . <p> " I 'd like to say thankyou to the Bendigo Thunder for having faith in me as a coach and to my husband and family for their support in letting me give up the time to do it , " O'Neill said . <p> " Emma Grant and Jess Kennedy as captain and vice-captain were a great support throughout the year , and working under Craig ( Riddiford ) last year also taught me a lot . " <p> O'Neill will coach on with the Thunder next season , with the club expanding to add a development team . <p> Meanwhile , the BUA 's win in the Umpire Group of the Year Award was the second time in three years it has received the accolade . <p> The BUA also won it in 2014 . <p> On hand to receive the award at Docklands was BUA chairman Sharon McColl and vice-chairman Paula Shay . <p> " It 's absolutely fantastic to win this award , " McColl said . <p> " Probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Bendigo Junior Football League to create the Umpiring Group . <p> " The aim of that was to ensure kids at under-12 level were being umpired at a standard that ensures it was correct and safe . <p> " We had training nights where we had parents attend and taught them the basics of umpiring , so that was really positive . <p> " But to win an award like this , it has to be a group effort and we 'd like to say thankyou to all our umpires who have done a fantastic job all year with their dedication in travelling to grounds across the region between Sea Lake and Gisborne ( 328 kms ) .

 could face up to 12 years in jail after allegedly being found with a packet of white powder in Bali . <p> Jamie Murphy could face a lengthy jail term in Bali if convicted on drug charges . Photo : Supplied <p> An Australian teenager , thought to be a school leaver in Bali , could face up to 12 years in jail after he was allegedly caught with a small packet of white powder by security guards at a Kuta nightclub . <p> Jamie Murphy from Perth was detained some time after 1am local time on Tuesday at the nightclub Skygarden . <p> The 18-year-old was held overnight at Kuta precinct . <p> Kuta Police Chief Commissioner Wayan Sumara said a white crystal substance was found on the teen but it is yet to be confirmed what it is . <p> " The evidence is still being tested , " Mr Sumara told reporters .

 taken our seats when the food starts arriving . Bowls of clear chicken broth , neat mounds of rice covered with tender slices of chicken and salads topped with papaya and pork all delivered by an army of staff in bright pink uniforms and white hats . <p> Bowie , our enthusiastic guide , recommends mixing the rice with soy sauce laced with chilli and the result is simple , spicy and delicious . <p> Established in 1960 , Go Ang restaurant in Bangkok 's Pratunam district specialises in khao man gai ( chicken rice ) . The open-sided eatery is far from fancy -- wooden stools crowd around metal tables while a handful of ceiling fans do little to cut through Bangkok 's crippling humidity . However , there 's a line of at least 20 people waiting outside plus another crowd huddled around a busy takeaway counter . <p> Bangkok is full of these simple , no-frills joints . Packed with locals but with no English signage or menus , they can be a daunting proposition for even the most intrepid traveller . Enter , a tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to exactly these sorts of authentic experiences -- whether it 's sampling street food in Bangkok , volunteering at an elephant sanctuary or planting rice with a hill tribe . <p> When we first meet Bowie outside Sam Yan MRT station , she explains that we 'll be visiting six places tonight -- three restaurants , a flower market , a temple and a " secret " venue she intriguingly describes as " her special place " . <p> How will we get between them ? By tuk-tuk , of course . Our group of 12 piles into a convoy of colourful tuk-tuks and we join the city 's frenetic traffic . It 's a quintessential Bangkok experience speeding through the sticky night air , engines screaming , the city a blur of fluorescent lights and neon signs . <p> After dessert at Go Ang ( sweet mango slices with sticky coconut rice ) , we hop back in our chariots and roar towards our next stop . <p> Miss Ann has been serving guay tiew kua gai ( rice noodles with stir fried chicken ) from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The dish is cooked over flaming gas-fired kilns in a tarpaulin-covered alleyway out the back a setup that would make a health and safety inspector back home have a seizure . <p> Bowie shows us which of the wide range of condiments to add ( sweet chilli sauce , chilli flakes and pickles in vinegar ) and the result is a spicy , eggy , chickeny triumph . <p> By now , even the Americans on the tour are full , but thankfully there 's a respite . Our next stop is Bangkok Flower Market , a huge indoor warren of vendors that operates 24 hours a day . We wander between stalls piled high with colourful blooms and lush green foliage , while trying not to get run over by an army of delivery men . <p> One of the city 's most popular tourist attractions is Wat Pho , a Buddhist temple complex with more than 90 stupas and one of the country 's largest statues of Buddha . However , what 's less well-known is that you can also explore the complex at night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) but also much less crowded . <p> When we arrive at 10:30pm , we have the place to ourselves . We take it in turns to place a lotus flower at the foot of one of the impressive 42-metre-high stupas and make a wish . <p> Bowie 's " special place " turns out to be a hidden rooftop bar with mesmerising views over the Chao Phraya River . Over a cleansing Chang beer , we watch barges chug past Wat Arun temple on the opposite bank and admire the glowing city skyline . <p> Normally , the tour concludes with the " best pad Thai in Bangkok " , but the restaurant is closed on Mondays so we have to settle for the " second best " , which , conveniently , is only two doors down . <p> We arrive at midnight to find a crowd of people gathered around two chefs cooking over fierce open fires .

It is a chunk of money I ca n't replace because I 'm retired . I will just cry tonight , " Mrs Dollery said . <p> " It took us 12 months to pay it off . It is absolutely devastating . " <p> The couple found out about their dire predicament on Thursday night from their travel agent , Cruise Traveller , which told them the cruise line was not offering refunds to any Australian clients . <p> Hundreds of the agent 's customers have been affected by the collapse . <p> Discover the World , which acts for All Leisure Group in Australia , said it was advising people to contact their travel agents , insurance companies or banks . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people affected and a lot of those people are elderly , " Discover the World 's country manager , Jeannie Foster , said . <p> " It was as much of a shock to us and to the rest of the industry .

 sporting fairytales ? <p> It 's a smaller scale , but could Bendigo summer sport replicate some of world sport 's fairytales of 2016 ? <p> WHEN looking back at 2016 from a sporting perspective , it will be remembered as the year of the drought-breakers . <p> Sandhurst captain-coach Craig Howard . <p> There was the AFL feelgood fairtytale story that was the Western Bulldogs winning their first premiership since 1954 ; <p> * the Cronulla Sharks , which entered in 1967 , winning their first NRL flag ; <p> * the Chicago Cubs winning their first Major League Baseball World Series in 108 years and breaking the " Curse of the Billy Goat " in an epic seven-game series against the Cleveland Indians ; <p> * Matthew Dellavedova 's Cleveland Cavaliers defying history to come from 3-1 down against the rampant Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals to win their first championship , and the city 's first major sporting title since 1964 ; and <p> * Leicester City 's improbable 5000-1 Premier League championship . <p> All remarkable stories that will make 2016 a sporting year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a much smaller scale , could the Bendigo summer sporting landscape also be on the cusp of some drought-breaking or first-time premiership success stories of its own come March ? <p> It 's certainly a possibility in the Emu Valley Cricket Association when the season resumed at the weekend with two of the top three teams -- Golden Gully and Sedgwick having never won a division one flag . <p> Sedgwick is a club that has its centenary approaching , with the Rams having history that can be traced back to 1918 , yet its cupboard is bare of a division one flag , as is Golden Gully 's in what 's now the Cobras ' 17th season in the EVCA . <p> In the Bendigo District Cricket Association , the competition is seemingly as wide open as it has been for some time evidenced that at the mid-season break the top five teams were all on 27 points . <p> Among those top five sides was Sandhurst the club that has the longest BDCA first XI premiership drought dating back to 1979 . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dragons have already proven this season with their arsenal in particular of spin bowling , including captain Craig Howard ( pictured ) , that their best is as good as any . <p> And in Bendigo Bowls Division weekend pennant , it has been 23 years since South Bendigo last won a division one flag in 1994 . <p> But if South can pick up from where it left off when it won its last five games before the mid-season break , there 's no reason why it ca n't go all the way and end its drought , too . <h> I Took A 
 Human Services spokesman said the rioting was brought to an end at 1.20am . <p> " There were no injuries to young people , staff or police and at no point was there a threat to the security of the perimeter of the facility , " he said . <p> " Damage to the facility will be assessed , with repair work to start as soon as this is completed . " <p> It is understood there was another incident on Friday night at the centre resulting in damage to property . <p> In late December , the Andrews government reclassified a section of the adult maximum-security Barwon Prison as a youth justice and remand centre after a Supreme Court ruling that it was unlawful to keep children in adult prison . <p> Teenagers as young as 15 were sent to the adult jail in November after destroying security cameras and ripping ceilings and walls apart , causing an estimated $2 million in damage . <p> The state opposition 's spokeswoman on children , Georgie Crozier , said on Sunday that Ms Mikakos should be removed . <p> Ms Crozier said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " This is an ongoing crisis , but the minister has been incapable of bringing youth justice under control , " Ms Crozier said . <p> " Premier Daniel Andrews needs to return from holiday .

 <h> Changing lanes cause of many freeway accidents , research finds <p> Next time you are stuck in heavy traffic on a Victorian freeway , you might want to think twice before changing lanes to get ahead . <p> New research by VicRoads reveals the crash rate on Melbourne 's freeway network surges sixfold at peak hour , and many of the collisions are caused by our compulsive lane-changing habits . <p> While Melbourne drivers have no hang-ups about weaving in front of other vehicles to try and inch ahead , we are less generous when others seek to do the same to us . It 's a selfish instinct that increases congestion and the likelihood of a crash , the research suggests . <p> VicRoads has studied the correlation between crashes and lane-changing behaviour on Melbourne 's busiest freeway , the Monash . <p> During peak hour there are typically about 2000 lane changes on each kilometre of the Monash Freeway . <p> In Melbourne , 100,000 new drivers and a similar number of vehicles join the road network each year , leading to an ever-increasing amount of traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it used to be , VicRoads manager , network optimisation John Gaffney says . <p> In his research , Mr Gaffney has found that in the morning peak , the rate of crashes on Melbourne 's managed freeway system is about five times greater than in off-peak times and about six times greater in the afternoon peak between 4pm and 5pm , the worst time for freeway crashes . <p> " When a freeway is reaching capacity and running heavy , which is now most of the day , there 's typically 2000 lane changes per hour , every kilometre , and the driver 's capability to handle that with close headways and gaps , is increasingly more complex than it was back in the 1970s , " Mr Gaffney said . <p> " So you start to get an idea on just one carriageway , how many chances of collisions occur . And what is happening on our freeways , is people close up so they do n't let other people in -- but they do n't realise that if everyone is making five or more lane changes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need that space themselves for the freeway to work . " <p> There is a delicate science to keeping traffic flowing that has led VicRoads to change the way it manages Melbourne 's freeways . <p> For many years the authority sought to get as much traffic as possible onto the freeways , only to learn that this creates congestion that slows down every journey by 20 to 40 per cent . <p> Technology such as ramp metering , which controls access to the freeway , aims to create a sweet spot of a 50-metre buffer between moving vehicles , which maximises traffic flow and leaves enough room for drivers to safely change lanes . <p> But VicRoads ' efforts to exert greater control of traffic flow have been controversial at times . <p> In 2015 it said that the speed limit on the Tullamarine Freeway and CityLink would be permanently cut from 100 km/h to 80 km/h once the current widening project is complete in 2018 , only to back away from the plan the next day following an outcry . <p> The authority 's approach to managing Melbourne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states including Utah and Arizona are trialling it on their freeways . <p> Mr Gaffney 's work on the link between congestion and collisions is set to take him to Europe this year on a Churchill Fellowship , awarded by a trust that funds overseas travel by Australians to conduct research they could not readily do here . <p> He will meet with vehicle control engineers , physicists , road safety experts and behavioural psychologists who are studying the human brain , and how much it can handle before it makes errors . <p> " What I hope this opportunity will lead to is new ideas in how we can manage motorways better , from a traffic point of view as well as a safety point of view , " he said . 
 <p> An international group of leading doctors and academics say up to one-third of many medical procedures are now being done unnecessarily , causing physical , psychological and financial harm that could threaten the viability of healthcare systems . <p> A landmark report in The Lancet medical journal said more needed to be done to address inappropriate medicine , which includes deliberate over-servicing by doctors for their own financial gain . <p> The researchers said about one in five knee replacements done after an arthroscopy to examine the joint in Australia were unnecessary , and that up to 70 per cent of operations to remove a woman 's uterus ( hysterectomy ) in the US were inappropriate . <p> They also highlighted excessive use of allergy tests , vitamin D tests , colonoscopies , mammograms , MRI scans for lower back pain , and ultrasound screening for thyroid cancer . <p> In South Korea , the researchers said 99 per cent of a common type of thyroid cancer was now thought to be overdiagnosed , meaning it was never going to cause harm . Despite this , many people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a 2 per cent risk of vocal cord paralysis . <p> Over-use of medicine , which paradoxically exists alongside under-use of evidence-based medicine , is driven by defensiveness among health professionals who fear being sued ; gaps in knowledge ; erroneous beliefs ; and lack of meaningful consultation with patients to understand their individual aims and preferences , the researchers said . <p> For example , some elderly people will not want a surgical investigation of a lump that could be cancerous when they 're likely to die within a few years . <p> Other doctors may not have kept up with research showing that glucosamine for osteoarthritis of the knee offers little benefit to most patients , and some might be so frightened of missing a bacterial infection in a child that they prescribe antibiotics for viral infections such as coughs and colds that do not respond to antibiotics . <p> One of the researchers , Professor Paul Glasziou ? of Bond University in Queensland , said while there was a " fairly small " group of doctors in Australia who knowingly over-service , most want to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said many well-intentioned health professionals were likely influenced by widening definitions of diseases driven by companies seeking to profit . <p> This applied to conditions such as " pre-diabetes " and new thresholds for high cholesterol , the latter of which has led to a growing proportion of people being prescribed lipid-lowering drugs with unclear benefits . <p> A new definition of chronic kidney disease has also led to large numbers of older people without symptoms being diagnosed , even though their urine shows no evidence of kidney damage . <p> The Lancet report said a fee-for-service payment system was likely fuelling the over-use of medicine in some countries . <p> The group said unnecessary medicine was expensive and likely to be undermining the sustainability of healthcare , with estimates it cost the US $210 billion in 2010 . <p> Professor Glasziou ? said there was widespread recognition of the complex problem in Australia , and that many medical groups were working to reduce over-testing , over-diagnosis and over-treatment of people who could be harmed by medicine . <p> He said the federal government 's review of Medicare was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still deserved taxpayer funding . <p> The part-time GP said some doctors might not be having detailed discussions with patients about the specific benefits and harms of tests and treatments , and what would happen if they chose to do nothing . He urged patients to prompt them so they know their options . <p> Researchers from the Lown Institute , University of Sydney , and Institute for Healthcare Improvement in the US , contributed to the Lancet series published on Monday . 
 <p> Disgraced former Education Department big wig Nino Napoli is among four people charged over their alleged involvement in a corrupt ring that swindled more than $6 million from Victorian state schools . <p> Mr Napoli , who was named by the Independent Broad-Based Anti-Corruption Commission as the " principal player " in the alleged scam , will appear before the Magistrates Court later this month alongside his cousin Carlo and former Keilor Heights Primary School principal Michael . <p> His distant cousin Daniel Calleja will appear before court in March and has been charged with conspiring to defraud , producing false documents and knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime . <p> Mr Napoli , who was the department 's finance manager , allegedly funnelled millions of dollars of funds earmarked for needy schools to companies run by his relatives between 2007 and 2014 . <p> The former department executive has been linked to at least $1.9 million in profits which allegedly benefited his relatives and associates , and a further $4.4 million in suspicious transactions and contracts . <p> A long-awaited report released by the anti-corruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through so-called " banker schools " by " carefully selecting and grooming principals and business managers " . <p> These principals allegedly signed off on false invoices and received a small cut of the transaction . <p> " The conduct uncovered during IBAC 's investigation was underpinned by a malevolent culture of non-compliance and entitlement , " the report said . <p> " Evidence suggests this practice to be pervasive and of long standing . " <p> The Operation Ord corruption hearing was told that Mr Napoli wanted to use taxpayer funds for his expensive toupee . <p> Mr Giulieri conceded during the 2015 hearing that he acted corruptly when he wrote a fake letter requesting $30,000 to pay for work that was never completed . <p> He allegedly wrote a bogus application requesting Education Department funds to pay Mr Napoli 's son for work he never did . <p> The saga has been a major embarrassment for the Education Department , which has abolished the banker school system which was allegedly abused by the officials . <p> It has previously said that every executive embroiled in the scandal no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges was welcomed by stakeholders , including the Australian Principals Federation . <p> " Every education dollar is so hard won . You hate to see a dollar wasted in any way , " APF president Julie Podbury said . <p> " We would be pleased to see the matter properly dealt with and finalised . " <p> Many of the officials implicated in Operation Ord were also involved in the disastrous $180 million Ultranet IT project , which is at the centre of a separate IBAC investigation called Operation Dunham. 
 <h> Driver catches serial car thief napping with the help of phone app <p> VIC : It was a citizen 's arrest . Wade Turner was found asleep in the car he had just stolen . <p> Wade Turner . <p> A Ballarat man who had his car stolen used the Find My iPhone app to chase down the thief and arrest the 19-year-old himself , a court has heard . <p> The thief , Wade Turner , was asleep in the back seat of the stolen Ford Ranger near St George 's Lake in Creswick when the owner tracked him down , the Ballarat Magistrates ' Court heard on Tuesday . <p> Woken by a torch light , Turner attempted to start the car before the owner used his spare key to open the door , grabbed Turner from the car and restrained him until police arrived . <p> The Ford Ranger had been stolen seven hours earlier from Victoria Park in Ballarat . <p> The court heard drug paraphernalia , a pocket knife and keys to another stolen car were found inside the Ranger . <p> Turner appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theft , in addition to the theft of another five cars from across the region between April and November . <p> The court heard during one of the thefts Turner was seen driving a stolen car on footpaths in Wendouree before driving into a parked car with children inside and leaving the scene . <p> The car was found two days later burnt out on Bald Hills Road , Creswick . <p> On another occasion Turner , and a 16-year-old co-accused , stole a 1984 Ford Laser from a Castlemaine Road , Creswick address which was later found abandoned in Invermay with ice pipes and the drug ice inside . <p> Turner 's lawyer , Wendy Duncan , told the court her client had taken full responsibility for the offending . <p> " He had firmly instructed he knows what he has done is wrong and does n't want me or anyone else making excuses for him , " she said . <p> She went on to tell the court Turner had been homeless since an early age , had scant contact with meaningful people in his life and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added Turner was realistic and knew there was a chance he would n't be able to comply with a community corrections order . <p> Ms Duncan urged the magistrate to instead consider placing Turner into a Youth Justice Centre with a long parole period to allow him a better opportunity to reestablish himself into the community and gain an apprenticeship he is yearning for . <p> Magistrate Gregory Robinson adjourned sentencing until Thursday to allow Turner to be assessed for a Youth Justice Centre . 
 <p> POLICE believe Samantha Kelly 's three housemates attempted to drug her to death before Peter Arthur eventually used a hammer to deliver a fatal blow later in the night . <p> Excerpts from Arthur 's interview with police in August were read to the Bendigo Magistrates ' Court on Wednesday , during the third day of a committal hearing for murder accused Christine Lyons , 45 , and Ronald Lyons , 44 . <p> The two have been charged with murdering Ms Kelly in Kangaroo Flat , while Arthur has already pleaded guilty to the charge . <p> The court also heard Christine Lyons discussed plans to kill Ms Kelly by pushing her into Mount Gambier 's Blue Lake during a holiday . <p> Detective Sergeant Sol Solomon was questioned about his interview with Arthur in Port Phillip Prison on September 12 , seven months after his arrest for murdering Ms Kelly . <p> During the interview , Arthur claimed himself , Christine Lyons and Ronald Lyons supplied Ms Kelly with prescription medication throughout the day , before she was murdered in the early hours of the next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overdose Samantha on the day of her death , and before that day , " Arthur told police . <p> " In the end it did n't work , so it was decided that she would be finished off in another way and that is why I killed her with the hammer . " <p> An unspecified amount of the sedative Phenergan was found in Ms Kelly 's liver during the autopsy . She was murdered on January 20 , and her body was found on February 11 . <p> In other parts of the police interview , Arthur claimed he did not intend to murder Ms Kelly when he went to her bungalow . <p> Peter Arthur has pleaded guilty to murdering Samantha Kelly with a hammer . <p> Arthur told police he was only in Ms Kelly 's bungalow at 2.30am -- when she was killed -- to collect a DVD because he could not sleep . <p> " Around 2.30am the next day , so after we had taken the tablets out to Sam , I went out to the unit to get a Walker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I opened the unit door and Sam was standing in the bedroom doorway . Samantha was groggy , she was n't really alert , was very unsteady , rocking back and forth , side to side . <p> " I think she was affected by the drugs that Christine and Ronald had taken out to her all day and night . " <p> Arthur denied he played any role in the drugging of Ms Kelly , and flushed tablets down the toilet because he thought " there were too many " . <p> He claimed he heard Christine and Ronald Lyons discuss killing Ms Kelly " 10 or 12 times each " in the weeks leading up to her death , including an alleged plan to murder her in Mount Gambier . <p> " They were thinking about taking a drive back over to South Australia where we 'd been once before with Samantha and the kids , " he said in the police interview . <p> " There 's a lake there that they call Blue Lake or something , it 's like an old crater , all fenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take her there and push her off into there . " <p> He said they made the decision to " get rid of " Ms Kelly because she " was n't take care ... of her kids " . The court earlier heard Christine Lyons believed two of the children were supposed to belong to her . <p> Christine Lyons arrives in the Bendigo Magistrates ' Court for the committal hearing . <p> When asked if it was decided that Ms Kelly would be " finished off " in a different way to the drugs , Arthur replied : " Probably " . It was the final question of the interview . <p> Arthur told police Christine and Ronald Lyons decided to concoct a story about Ms Kelly 's disappearance while he was away burying the body in bushland west of Bendigo . <p> Arthur will be called to give evidence to the hearing on Friday . <p> Defence counsel Chris Dane , acting for Christine Lyons , said Arthur attempted to separate himself from the actions of Christine and Ronald Lyons at various stages of the police interview . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upgraded to murder on September 26 -- two weeks after Arthur 's interview with police in prison . Christine Lyons ' charge was upgraded to murder on August 11 . <p> The three were charged with murder as part of a " joint criminal enterprise " . <p> Detective Sergeant Solomon told the court there was no evidence to suggest there was a plan to use an " implement " to murder Ms Kelly . <p> Allan Walkom , who travelled with the three accused , Ms Kelly and her children to Mount Gambier , was called as a witness during the hearing on Wednesday . <p> He was asked whether Christine Lyons can be " quite childlike in the way in which she addresses issues " , but Mr Walkom disagreed . 
 <p> Shane and Sharon have made the list for top baby names in Victoria . Just kidding . That was 50 years ago . <p> In truth , Charlotte has seized the throne as the queen of baby names for girls in 2016 , usurping Olivia . <p> Charlotte is the French feminine form of ' Charles ' . <p> The name no doubt grew in popularity after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge , Prince William and Catherine , chose it for their royal daughter in May 2015 . <p> However , Olivia along with Mia , Amelia and Ava all remained in the top five from 2015 , while Evelyn broke into the top 20 to replace Sienna . <p> Oliver took the crown as most popular boys ' name for the third year in a row , according to the Victorian Registry of Births , Deaths and Marriages . <p> Jack , William and Noah also made a repeat appearance in the top five boys ' names list for the second year in a row , while James edged out Thomas to round out the top five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Benjamin in the top 20 . <p> Oliver , a common medieval name , is of French origin and ostensibly means ' olive tree ' . <p> Attorney-General Martin Pakula said there was a return to traditional names in 2016 . <p> " While names have changed significantly over the past fifty years , it seems there are some old favourites including Jack , James , Emily and Chloe .

 <p> There 's something delightfully romantic about reclining on the grass at sunset with a picnic and a glass of bubbly to a classic film under the stars . <p> Many of us have been to Moonlight Cinema before but this summer , Melburnians are spoilt for choice when it comes to outdoor cinemas , with dozens sprouting up in the city , the ' burbs and in holiday destinations . <p> We counted at least 30 , from one-off community fundraisers to full-blown programmed events like the new Shimmerlands festival at the University of Melbourne , which runs until the end of February . Some have a selection of food trucks and music performances prior to screenings . <p> Small pop-up cinema companies have made it easy for councils and venues to put on screenings . They bring all the gear , provide crew and front of house , sort out film licensing , screen it and pack it all up again for around $1500 to $2000 . Venues recoup the cost through sales of tickets , food and drinks . <p> Gus Berger started Blow Up Cinema six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locations including a screening of Chopper ( 2000 ) in the watchtower of Old Melbourne Gaol . Since then demand for his services has skyrocketed . <p> " God , it 's so busy this summer , " he says . " We pick up new clients every year . " <p> There are some films that are just made for the romance of a summer evening , like Oscars favourite La La Land , complete with singing and dancing by the twinkling lights of Hollywood . <p> Not all small-time cinemas can get the latest releases due to licensing arrangements . But that 's just a great opportunity to show old favourites . <p> The picturesque Coombe winery in the Yarra Valley is trying out a one-off outdoor cinema screening for the first time . They 've chosen Dirty Dancing ( 1987 ) because it 's a staff favourite . <p> Aussie classics like The Castle ( 1997 ) and Crackerjack ( 2002 ) are also popular .

" It was quite emotional -- somebody who was in the movie came , too . " <h> Top tips for open air cinemas <p> Plan ahead and book early to avoid disappointment for one-night only shows , as some cinemas have limited capacity . <p> Check the screening time and arrive with plenty of time to spare if you want good seats . <p> Be mindful of the venue 's food and drinks policy . Some will allow you to bring a picnic , others will have food and drinks available for purchase . <p> If you want to snack and chat during the film , choose a cinema with speakers . Some are " silent " cinemas that provide viewers with a set of headphones . <p> Most venues will have a wet weather policy and provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Do n't forget : insect repellent ; extra clothing or a blanket ; something to sit on if not already provided by the venue . <h> New this summer <p> Shimmerlands , University of Melbourne , Parkville . After five years at Abbotsford Convent , the Shadow Electric team have a new venue screening a range of new releases and classics , with an emphasis on arthouse , cult and music documentaries . Do n't miss Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner in the 1992 romantic thriller The Bodyguard on Valentines Day . <p> Backlot Rooftop Drive-in , Docklands . Private cinema Backlot has opened up its rooftop to the public , showing a small selection of new release and classic films . There 's an outdoor seated section for people who do n't have cars .

 <p> TOO many children do not have the basic skills that could save their lives in the water , swimming school operators say . <p> Their comments follow a worrying spike in drownings in Australia this summer , the most recent in Victoria being the death of an eight-year-old boy at Lake Hume , near Wodonga , last Tuesday . <p> Ash Sloan , from Sloan Swim School , said he believed there was a general lack of both skills and awareness of water safety , and it was an issue that needed to be addressed . <p> The same sentiment was expressed by Peter Krenz Leisure Centre director Terri Potter , who said the 43 drownings in Victoria in 2015-16 suggested a need for more education , particularly given this region had a significant number of waterways , dams and lakes . <p> Research from Life Saving Victoria has revealed that teachers estimate two in five Grade 6 students lack adequate knowledge to avoid getting into dangerous situations in and around water . <p> Harley Street Swim School owner Linda Holmes said she had had children come to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do if they got into trouble in the water . <p> Examples of basic life-saving skills , given by Mr Sloan , include being able to float , roll over , get the head above water and get out of the water . <p> All teachers agreed that the earlier children were developed these skills and learnt about water safety , the better . <p> Mr Sloan said issues of affordability , accessibility and quality of some programs might mean some children were restricted in learning such skills and knowledge . <p> But Ms Potter believes compulsory swimming lessons in schools , to be delivered as part of the Victorian curriculum from this year , will help bring down the number of drownings . <p> Parents and other caregivers being aware of potential hazards has also been highlighted as an important factor in boosting water safety for children . <p> Mrs Holmes urged people to be mindful of not only pools , but any bodies of water around their homes that could be dangerous for children , including ponds , tubs of water and spas . <p> But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adults are lacking crucial skills . <p> Ms Potter said it was particularly an issue for some people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds because they had not had access to such education in their country of origin . <p> This had been the experience of Mrs Holmes ' son Daniel , who taught adult swimming lessons , with many students new Australians who had not previously had the opportunity to learn . 
 <p> WHEN a Bendigo aged care facility decided to change its name , a simple re-brand was probably the only thing on the board 's mind . <p> But the decision inadvertently -- set in motion a series of events that left one of its former employees owing $2558 to Centrelink . <p> At least that 's what Rob K and his accountant have since discovered . <p> He was one of the tens of thousands of Australians to receive a Centrelink debt recovery letter in the second half of 2016 as part of an automated nationwide audit . <p> Rob received his letter on October 27 last year . <p> " It looked like it was guilty until proven innocent , " he said . <p> The Bendigo man took it to an accountant , and then another , but neither could explain the discrepancy . He had always declared his income , and had not received government benefits for years . <p> It was only when he scrutinised his debt schedule report did he spot something unusual . <p> " Centrelink thought I was working two jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , was that never happened . <p> One job was the aged care facility and the other job , surprisingly for Rob , was also the aged care facility . <p> The change in name appeared to have created two separate businesses , at least according to Centrelink and the Australian Taxation Office . <p> But both still had the same ABN . <p> The ATO had added $1013 per fortnight income from this mythical second job to his report . Rob never received the money , but apparently he earned it , and apparently it had bumped him up to a new tax bracket . <p> He owed Centrelink $2558 . <p> " I spoke with four different people at Centrelink . The first three were rude , but I managed to get someone helpful on the fourth occasion , " Rob said . <p> " I made a dozen calls and was on hold for about 15 minutes each time . " <p> After providing evidence of the mistake , his debt was knocked down to $590 . But he now had an accountant 's bill of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point where you decide you can put up with $590 . You just want it to go away , " Rob said . <p> " The whole system needs to be scrapped and re-started . People are now thinking that enough is enough . <p> " If they had just cross-referenced the ABN , they would see it 's the same company . " <p> Centrelink 's new automated debt recovery system has become a major political talking point across the country in the last month , since a woman claimed she had incorrectly been sent a debt letter asking for $24,000 . <p> An increasing number of people have challenged their debt letters , including those in central Victoria . <p> Rob hopes his story encourages others to come forward . <h> To and fro with Centrelink on phone , by mail and online <p> In the space of five days , Flora Hill resident Robyn Nielson went from owing Centrelink almost $1200 , to being owed money herself . <p> The first letter arrived on November 18 . <p> " I thought it was a scam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a debt of $1194 with a debt recovery fee of $96 . It was sent to an address she lived at five years ago . <p> Centrelink could not identify where the debt had come from and , on November 23 , sent another letter . <p> This time , the intent was slightly different .

The Bendigo men are running 100 kilometres to raise awareness and funds for autism . <p> TRAVIS Edwards and Dan O'Bree are going a long way to support children with autism . <p> The Bendigo mates will next month run 100 kilometres through Victoria 's High Country to raise awareness and funds for the condition which affects one in 100 Australian children . <p> About 100 teams of two will tackle the Oscars 100 on February 17-19 , which will support Mansfield Autism Statewide Services , an independent organisation assisting young people living with autism and their families . <p> Edwards , a social worker , said the decision to tackle the inaugural endurance challenge was an easy one to make . <p> " When you see the battle families living with autism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of a battle , " he said . <p> " Obviously it will be a physical and mental challenge for Dan and I , but it 's nothing compared to the challenge of autism . <p> The trek through Mount Buller will involve 5700 metres of climbing . <p> It will be Edwards ' first attempt at the 100km distance , while O'Bree , a policeman , has done it before . <p> The run has a 55-hour cut-off , with runners able to stop for sleep or food breaks at two designated hut checkpoints . <p> Edwards and O'Bree intend completing the course in one hit . <p> " You have to get to a certain point , 70 kilometres , in 15 hours , " O'Bree said . <p> " If you do n't get to that point you have to stay the night , but we 're not keen on staying overnight .

 <h> Malmsbury inmates sent to adult custody <p> Four inmates who caused $65,000 damage to Malmsbury centre to be transferred to adult custody . <p> FOUR inmates at Malmsbury Youth Justice Centre will be transferred to the adult prison system for allegedly causing $65,000 damage to the centre during a riot last week . <p> Van Uk , 19 , James Nunn , 18 , Grayson Toilolo , 18 , and Joshua Keuth , 18 , were held on remand at the Grevillia Unit at Barwon Prison over the weekend while a magistrate considered whether to permanently move them to the adult system . <p> Their matter was heard before the Bendigo Magistrates ' Court on Monday . <p> The court heard the four inmates , along with two minors , allegedly covered CCTV cameras before jumping over a duty point counter and stealing the metal legs from tables at 1.15pm on Thursday . <p> They allegedly smashed a door to the courtyard and were seen to " go from unit to unit " . A total of 30 windows , two air conditioning units , a washing machine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Malmsbury response team could not stop the inmates , so the Victoria Police Critical Incident Response Team was called in . <p> The only injury from the incident was a scratched finger . <p> The inmates were each charged with one count of criminal damage . <p> Magistrate Sarah Leighfield had to consider each inmate 's alleged role in the incident , their age , prior convictions , remaining length of their sentence and whether further management layers could be put in place to prevent further incidents . <p> The court heard three of them -- minus Nunn were involved in a gang in the Malmsbury centre , and each had served time in isolation under the individual behaviour management plans . The plan lasts for a maximum of 72 hours , with a further assessment afterwards . <p> Toilolo had met with the parole board to discuss his behaviour three days before the incident . Toilolo and Uk allegedly assaulted staff members in the past . <p> and Nunn have allegedly assaulted " vulnerable clients " in the centre . <p> Malmsbury Youth Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys would pass a " suitability assessment " to return to the centre . <p> He said they had exhausted each layer of management , and isolation was no longer an effective tool . <p> " I believe isolation is n't a long-term solution for the clients , it 's a short-term solution to get them back on track , " Mr Madigan said . <p> " I think the adult system has more access to behaviour management units to separate these four clients . " <p> Mr Madigan said " systemic problems " in the youth justice system had contributed to the rise in violent incidents and rioting . <p> The four spent the weekend in 23-hour lockdown in the Grevillia Unit at Barwon Prison , which the state government earlier gazetted to allow for youth inmates . <p> There were no reported problems from the weekend . <p> Prosecutor Senior Constable Cherree Blair said each client was at the highest level of management already , and they " can not be properly controlled " . <p> Chris Wareham , representing Toilolo , said the " emergency situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious " about moving into adult custody . <p> Magistrate Leighfield said transferring the inmates to adult custody was a " last resort " , but all other options had been exhausted . <p> The four were remanded in custody to appear in the Bendigo Magistrates ' Court on February 9. 
 <p> Melbourne 's hottest day of the summer so far was just after Christmas , on December 28 , when the temperature it hit 38.2 degrees . <p> " It looks like it 's going to be equal that on Tuesday and be one of the hottest days of the summer so far , " Mr Stewart said . <p> At the Open , play is only called off once the " wet bulb globe " temperature based on the advice of the weather bureau , a meteorologist and the tournament doctor reaches a level of both heat and humidity that organisers believe is too much . <p> There is no set number , but depending on humidity , Tuesday 's top of 38 degrees could send the event 's heat policy into effect .

 <h> Journeying through the landscapes of us <p> 17 Jan 2017 , 1:07 p.m . <p> The Bendigo Art Gallery 's new exhibition celebrates and critiques this land we call Australia . <p> An incredible array of landscape works , from early European and colonial works to post-colonial and contemporary , form part of Bendigo Art Gallery 's forthcoming exhibition , Collective Vision : 130 years , depicting the land and the built environment as both a sublime and a contested space . <p> A highlight is the work of George Rowe who arrived in Australia in 1852 , seeking fortune on the Victorian goldfields . <p> He met with almost overwhelming success as a documenter of the formative periods of Australian history , earning a gold medal in 1862 at the International Exhibition in London . <p> The End of the Rainbow , Golden Square depicts the Bendigo goldfields , describing the degradation of the landscape and the life of diggers spurred on in anticipation of prosperity . Rowe conveyed a sense of empathy for the natural environment in his unromantic description of the harsh deforestation . Amidst the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clouds the distant promise of civilisation that marked the beginnings of Golden Square . <p> Contrasting with this is the work of contemporary Australian artist Michael Cook . Born in Brisbane in 1968 , Cook is a Bidjara man of south-west Queensland . Cook 's first solo show was in 2010 , but in a short time he has been recognised for his unique perspective and visual storytelling ability . <p> His awards include 2008 and 2011 Deadly Awards for Visual Artist of the Year , and 2011 People 's Choice Award in the Western Australian Indigenous Art Awards <p> Cook 's series Stickmen , presents the journey of a fictional Stickman a universal perception of man drawn by man playing out traditional poses from Aboriginal rock paintings depicting hunting , tribal war and early colonialisation . The images bear the graininess of old photographs or parchment . <p> A sense of tragedy builds as symbols of white settlement ( a dead kangaroo , a hill hoist ) begin to appear within the frame , and the stickman is left ultimately alone and disengaged from his landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , local artist Donna Bailey has explored the themes of childhood , young parenthood and regional life . Purchased in 2010 in memory of Wynne Baring through the Bendigo Art Gallery Foundation , New Moon #10 is from a series that included luscious , large-scale chromogenic and duratran prints . <p> These link her practice more intimately with the physical and psychological experience of living on the fringe of mining sites near Kangaroo Flat in Bendigo . <p> ARCHETYPAL : Michael Cook 's Stickman #1 features the universal human in an evolving land .

 <p> For the past 15 years , he has organised a January 26 breakfast in his hometown of Strathfieldsaye . <p> But the Bendigo businessman and volunteer will be the focus of the 2017 ceremonies after he was named Bendigo 's Citizen of the Year . <p> The honour was bestowed on the 60-year-old Keech Australia director for his two decades of service to Strathfieldsaye community organisations , particularly the town 's first scouts group . <p> Not only has he filled several positions on the group 's committee , but he also oversaw the rebuilding and refurbishing of its scout hall . <p> Mr Keech is also a fixture of Strathfieldsaye sport clubs , coaching soccer with the Colts and acting as a medic for the town 's football team . <p> Girton Grammar School students have played volleyball under his tutelage too . <p> The honouree was humble when asked about his volunteer work , saying he just " tagged along " to his four children 's sporting commitments and offered " support in the background " . <p> But community service was part of his personality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to be able to say ' no ' and help out wherever I can , " he said . <p> It was because of its community-mindedness Mr Keech committed himself to the scouting movement . <p> " ( It is an ) opportunity for them ( scouts ) to become community-minded , to be involved with that community , to be help out , the opportunity to develop leadership skills and life skills , " he said . <p> His dedication to Bendigo is obvious . He supported several fundraising appeals and despite moving from Sydney 22 years ago , he still boasted to friends about Bendigo 's assets , including its parkland and his short commute to work . <p> " A little bit more rain would be nice , " he said , laughing . <p> While the Citizen of the Year announcement will bring to Mr Keech into the Bendigo CBD on Australia Day , he will still spend the morning at his breakfast . <p> It 's in my nature not to be able to say ' no ' and help out wherever I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> About 600 residents attend the event . <p> The day was a celebration of " all things Australian " , he said . <p> " It 's that easy going mateship , the camaraderie you see and people just getting out .

 <h> Standing up for the young <p> Nothing was more frustrating for a young Tilak Ramesh than being told she was not old enough to contribute to her community . <p> But it was a message she heard time and time again while growing up in Bendigo . <p> " That made me really annoyed , but I was like , ' Probably should n't argue with people who are older than I am , " she said . <p> Fortunately , she persevered . <p> Now 19 , the law student has become a Red Cross young humanitarian leader and co-founded Bendigo group Young People for Refugees , a group of youth who provide support those who have just arrived in Australia . <p> She also serves on the board of Community Leadership Loddon Murray as well as volunteering for Benetas . <p> Those efforts were celebrated on Wednesday when mayor Margaret O'Rourke named Ms Tilah Ramesh the city 's Young Citizen of the Year for 2017 . <p> The teen described the honour as " surreal " . <p> " I can think of a billion other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> Ms Tilak Ramesh hoped she could push for more leadership opportunities that empowered young people to turn their dreams into a reality . <p> Young people 's ideas should not be dismissed as " silly " , she said . <p> " The main problem I see , especially at uni , is a lot of people have good ideas , they just do n't know how to put it into practice . <p> " What 's lacking is that self-esteem sort of stuff that tells them to stray from the groove and think of something else . " <p> A whole of community approach was required to coax out the best in its young people , she said , explaining the adage ' It takes a village to raise a child ' had resonated with her since childhood . <p> " The child can have intrinsic motivation but its up to the community to inspire that , " Ms Tilak Ramesh . <p> Asked what motivated her to give so generously of her time , the young citizen of the year said it was the hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resonated with me since I was younger is , ' It takes a community or a village to raise a child ' . - Tilak Ramesh , young citizen of the year <p> While the details of that future was uncertain , Ms Tilak Ramesh was sure community spirit , something she described as Bendigo greatest asset , would be passed from generation to generation . 
 <h> Principals welcome new school <p> Bendigo principals have thrown their support behind a new school for at risk youth . <p> Bendigo South East College principal Ernie Fleming , Weeroona College Bendigo principal Leanne Preece and Bendigo Senior Secondary College principal Dale Pearce at the site of the new Flexible Learning Option school in Kangaroo Flat . Picture : JASON WALLS <p> Bendigo secondary school principals have thrown their support behind a new state government school for youth at risk of dropping out of the education system . <p> Speaking during a tour of the building that will eventually host the new Flexible Learning Option facility yesterday , Weeroona College Bendigo principal Leanne Preece said the school would not only fill the gap left by the closure of Anglicare 's Educational Services Unit but " take it to a new level " . <p> " I 've been a principal in this region for a long time and have always felt that there 's a need for another option for some of our young people , " she said . <p> " There are diverse young people in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone , we need that flexibility to offer different programs to suit the needs of all of our young people . " <p> Bendigo South East College principal Ernie Fleming said while he could not speak highly enough of the work of the Anglicare ( formerly St Luke 's ) staff at the ESU , the backing of the Education Department would help ensure the new school had a more sustainable future . <p> " St Luke 's had picked up this group of kids for us for some years but that was n't sustainable either , so getting something that provided more for kids was critical and it 's really impressive the department 's understood that and understood these sorts of settings are critical if we are going to reach every young person , " he said . <p> " It 's now supported by the education structure which I think is important in making it sustainable and giving it a more sustainable future . " <p> Bendigo Senior Secondary College principal Dale Pearce also welcomed the new initiative as a means of filling the gap left by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In the first instance it 's a response to the closure of the Educational Services Unit that St Luke 's were running and so I think it 's actually able to pick up a much broader cohort of kids than that and so a really welcome option I think , " he said . <p> Ms Preece said while the school 's permanent home in Kangaroo Flat was still under construction , it 's programs would be available to students from the beginning of term one . <p> " I 've had a couple of staff working through my school even yesterday just making contact with parents and students , starting to look at enrolments , so it may not be happening on this site from day one but it 's already happening , " she said . 
 <p> Melbourne will be lashed with up to six hours of heavy rain on Thursday night , but the weather bureau says the downpour is unlikely to delay play on day five of the Australian Open . <p> A severe weather warning has been issued for half of Victoria , with rain and flash flooding forecast from Melbourne to the South Australian border . <p> Senior forecaster Richard Carlyon said up to six hours of heavy rain was forecast for Melbourne overnight . <p> " The issue for Melbourne is heavy rain on Friday morning , likely to commence around 4am and finish around 9am , " he said . <p> " We could have 10 to 30 millimetres of rainfall across the Melbourne area . " <p> Mr Carlyon said the rain could cause problems for the start of day five of the Australian Open , but it was likely conditions would improve from mid-morning . <p> " There could be issues , there could be delays at the start of the day 's play but certainly improvements for the afternoon , " he said . <p> The Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hit western Victoria on Thursday night and move rapidly eastwards across the state in the early hours of Friday morning . <p> " It 's mainly storm activity in South Australia , but by the time it reaches here , it will be more of a rain band .

" <p> The bureau has warned of possible flash flooding in the Mallee , Wimmera and South-West districts between midnight and 3am Friday , and in the Northern Country , North Central and Central districts between 3am and 6am . <p> The State Emergency Service is advising residents not to drive or walk through flood water , stay away from creeks and storm drains and be aware of debris and the risk of landslides in areas recently affected by fires . <p> The temperature is forecast to reach 21 degrees on Friday afternoon , after a low of 17 degrees in the morning .

 <h> Why we 're going to pay up to $220 a year more for electricity <p> It is the perfect storm for power prices . Not only has the cost of electricity been pushed up by the looming closure of Hazelwood power station , domestic gas prices have also been knocked for six . It 's not that Victoria lacks an abundant supply of offshore gas , but rather energy companies can now make more money sending it overseas . <p> Add in a moratorium on onshore gas production imposed by the Victorian government and nervousness about the ability of the grid of cope with any further loss of base-load capacity , and you have to think the only way for power prices is up . <p> To state the obvious , this is bad news for households , facing average annual price rises for electricity of between $120 and $220 , and for energy-intensive businesses , many of which are already complaining they are being squeezed . <p> The issue is also diabolical for governments . Remember when we were collectively debating the future of the local car-making industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car makers to stop dithering and make a decision about whether to leave , declaring : " Either you 're here or you 're not . " <p> The sentiment in conservative circles was that big companies should be made to stand on their own . The days of big taxpayer-funded bailouts for industry seemed to be drawing to a close . <p> The situation for Alcoa 's Portland aluminium smelter provides another interesting example . For decades , the smelter had reaped the benefits in heavily subsidised power , sent 500 kilometres across the state at taxpayers ' expense . <p> When the world price of aluminium went down , the subsidy went up . The deal had cost taxpayers billions since it was locked in by the Cain government in 1982 . In 2010 , the former Brumby government assured Victorians that no further taxpayer subsidies would be handed out when the contract expired in 2016 . <p> As Treasurer Tim Pallas revealed in March last year , the arrangement has been costing " well in excess of $100 million " for some years , confirming it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , quite suddenly , the mainstream thinking on industry policy seemed to change . This coincided with the election of industry policy activists such as Donald Trump in the United Sates , and Paul Hanson and Nick Xenophon in Australia . <p> There is now serious anxiety in Liberal ranks that disgruntled voters are bleeding to One Nation , which , according to some polls , is capturing almost 10 per cent of the state vote . <p> This at least partly explains the change in political sentiment . The Liberal state opposition has for weeks been claiming the Andrews government should have done more to bailout Hazelwood , which is more than 40 years old . <p> News that the plant would be closed earlier than expected sent the market into a spin . That in turn led to the temporary cessation of negotiations between Alcoa and AGL over a new electricity supply deal . AGL 's view appeared to be that until the outlook for power prices was more certain , it would not be committing . <p> As the Australian Energy Market Operator pointed out last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have never before faced such a high level of uncertainty in our long-term planning forecasts . " <p> Then , after various interventions from state and federal governments , it was back to the negotiating table for AGL and Alcoa . <p> At a marathon 12-hour meeting last Sunday , chaired by state treasurer Tim Pallas , the price and length of a new electricity supply were broadly agreed to . Victoria is believed to have offered about $200 million to Alcoa to keep the plant running , and the Commonwealth $40 million in an interest-free loan . <p> To complicate things , all of that followed a crippling power outage in December which caused molten aluminium in more than 200 smelting pots to cool and solidify at the Portland smelter , leaving the plant running at one-third of its capacity . <p> The consequences for Portland of letting Alcoa close the smelter would be enormous . The plant directly employs 600 people , with as many as 180 contractors and 2000 indirect jobs . <p> In this sense , the level of political squeamishness about Alcoa is understandable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting half a town go under . And while $240 million over four years might seem like a lot , it is still only about half the level of assistance offered under the previous subsidy arrangement . <p> Even so , the looming deal to keep the plant going is having some major flow-on effects . Not least among them is a view that it will keep power prices high , given the smelter is the state 's biggest power user , consuming about 10 per cent of the total . <p> This is undoubtedly good news for AGL . In a note to investors , investment firm Morgan Stanley concluded AGL was better off offering discounted power to Alcoa because this would keep wholesale power prices higher . <p> In other words , the deal is ultimately going to come at the expense of households and other businesses . Now energy-intensive businesses are arcing up about the impact . <p> As the AFR revealed this week , big energy users like BHP Billiton and Dow Chemicals have accused AGL of imposing 50 to 100 per cent power price increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politically sensitive . <p> The argument is that all energy users , not just a select few , should benefit from lower prices . This neatly illustrates pitfalls of selective industry policy . Help one company , and it often comes at the expensive of others . Then , before you know it , everyone wants a handout . <p> There is nothing wrong with industry policy , but it needs to be strategic and long term , not knee-jerk and reactive . Governments have known for years that the days of cheap , power would draw to an end . <p> Yet they failed to take action to create an alternative . Now we are feeling the consequences . Hang on to your seats , because chances are , it 's only going to get worse .

 <h> New paramedics in training before coming to central Victoria <p> Central Victoria will soon receive new paramedics as part of a plan to boost the ambulance system . <p> BOOST : Three new paramedics are coming to central Victoria under a plan to improve the ambulance system . <p> THREE of the 48 new paramedics who started their induction training yesterday will be deployed in central Victoria under a state government plan to improve ambulance response times . <p> The three paramedics include two ambulance community officers -- first responders employed on a casual basis to provide advanced first aid in communities with a low caseload who will become fully qualified paramedics . <p> They will be based at Castlemaine , Kyneton and Woodend . <p> An Ambulance Victoria spokeswoman said the locations were determined " based on a range of factors including where paramedics can be effectively trained , exposed to a range of experiences and matched with the area of greatest need " . <p> A performance report from July to September last year showed 54 per cent of the most urgent cases in Mount Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 minutes , with an average response time of 18 minutes and 16 seconds . <p> In the Macedon Ranges , this figure was 59 per cent and an average time of 14 minutes and 48 seconds . <p> For Ambulance Victoria as a whole the proportion was 77 per cent , but the statewide target was 85 per cent . <p> The 48 paramedics are the first cohort of 450 additional paramedics the government has promised to recruit over the next two and a half years as part of a $500 million package aimed at improving the ambulance system . <p> Three of the 48 are ambulance community officers . <p> The new paramedics will be out and ready to respond to emergencies from February 13 . <p> Under the government 's improvement plan , there will also be six new " super response " centres , 15 new or upgraded stations , and 12 new rural services . <p> Pyramid Hill , Lockington and Dingee will be serviced by one of these rural services , which will be staffed by a paramedic community support co-ordinator who will both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Tongala , Stanhope , Nagambie and Moira West will also share a new rural service . <p> Loddon Shire had just 39 per cent of its most urgent cases responded to within 15 minutes between July and September last year , while in Campaspe Shire this figure sat at 65 per cent . 
 <p> THE ultimately fruitless battle by former Empire Rubber workers to recover their lost funds following the business ' demise could be used as an example to reform Victoria 's litigation system . <p> The Victorian Law Reform Commission will review the rules covering litigation funds this year , with a report to be released in just over 12 months . <p> Empire Rubber workers won $4.5 million in 2016 after a 10-year battle to recover lost entitlements from CBL Insurance , but the funds were soaked up in legal fees and litigation costs . <p> Former workers at the Bendigo site did not see a cent of the money . <p> National Union of Workers Victorian secretary Gary Maas said " unjust outcomes " were prevailing in the state 's justice system . <p> " Regional workers had justice denied in their case with CBL Insurance , " he said . <p> " The system allowed millions of dollars awarded to them to be absorbed in legal costs , and in paying 45 per cent to the litigation funder . <p> " Justice is not served when successful plaintiffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are owed . " <p> Empire Rubber employees were given a $9.5 million pay out from a government scheme in 2007 to cover annual and long service leave , and 16 weeks redundancy pay . Legal proceedings were launched in 2011 to claim $4.4 million of the remaining $5.8 million shortfall . <p> The result from the litigation left some employees owed tens of thousands of dollars . 
 <p> A Bendigo family facing homelessness has described the toll a fruitless search for affordable housing has taken on their emotional wellbeing . <p> Tara McGrath moved into an Epsom rental property with her husband and three children in 2012 . <p> But the family of five was issued with a 120-day notice to vacate the house late last year , just months after Ms McGrath 's husband was retrenched . <p> They have just one more month to find alternative shelter before they find themselves homeless . <p> But despite submitting 13 rental applications and seeking assistance from the state 's public housing authorities , the family remains without a place to which they can relocate . <p> Ms McGrath believed landlords refused her tenancy on financial grounds ; rent payments had fallen two weeks in arrears since her husband was laid off . <p> " We 're still applying even though we know we 'll get knocked back , because we do n't know what else to do , " she said , adding that the ordeal was " very hard " on her and her children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while she suffers from chronic pain , both conditions she said the stress of house-hunting had exacerbated . <p> Almost 1200 other people in Bendigo are on a waitlist for community housing . <p> Haven ; Home , Safe acting chief executive officer Niall Hensey said families were part of a rising homeless trend and could face waits of up to one year before a long-term option became available . <p> The longest waits were experienced by those needing single bedroom homes , but a shortage of four-plus bedroom stock also left large families in the cold , Mr Hensey said . <p> " Many families endure their situation in housing stress , because the alternative is to be homeless , " he said . <p> " For those who can not , rental arrears can lead to eviction . " <p> If they can not secure a new home before their February 25 moving date , the McGrath family will bide their time in a friend 's caravan that they will park on a corner of another loved one 's block of land . <p> The site does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of the last ditch effort , " Ms McGrath said . <p> " I 'm not entirely sure how that will go for their mental health , to be honest . " <p> Until then they are relying on gifts of food and money from family members to get by . <p> Saltworks Eaglehawk volunteer Ian Shelton said the cost of living , including rent , was cause for many people to seek out his organisation 's community pantry . <p> Saltworks grocery donations fed almost 250 people every week in 2016 . <p> He said the demand for services like his was not manageable . <p> " As much as we do what we do , it does n't really address all of the financial needs and concerns of any family , " Mr Shelton said . <p> " There 's not enough we can give to really beat the problem . " <p> Asked what she would tell the real estate and housing sectors if given the chance , Ms McGrath said : " Be willing to give us a chance to rent a house . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a chance would be nice . " <p> She also objected to media portrayals of the homeless as " bludgers " , which she said were not characteristic of her family . <p> Despite her chronic pain making work difficult , Ms McGrath did not qualify for a disability pension , and while her husband continued applying for jobs , he continued to be turned away by every employer he approached . <p> He also completed a short course of study in the hope it would make him more employable. 
 <h> Editorial : What we can learn is all we can salvage <p> Victoria 's police pursuit policy has been thrust to the front of discussions in the week since the horror attack resulting in the deaths of five innocent people in central Melbourne . <p> Deputy Commissioner Andrew Crisp circulated what he has termed a " safety message " to officers last September telling them not to shoot at or intercept stolen or suspect cars . The email was sent after a serious incident in Wodonga where an officer fired three shots into the tyres of a vehicle stolen by Keith King on September 11 last year . <p> The previous day , the 22-year-old had sped on the wrong side of the Hume Highway from Wodonga to Albury at 150km/h to avoid arrest . <p> Mr Crisp said this week he was extremely disappointed that the email he sent out had been reported as a " directive " . But whatever word one might choose to label the email , it is fair to say that a communication from one of the state 's most senior police chiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As details have emerged about the lead-up to last Friday 's Bourke Street carnage , anger has been levelled at police with suggestions they had several opportunities to stop the accused , Jimmy Gargasoulas , earlier in the day . <p> Union secretary Detective Senior Sergeant Ron Iddles said there were several occasions where police believed they could have safely intercepted and arrested him . He says the reason they did not was because they were instructed by superiors not to . <p> The police response and actions that day are a matter for Victorian State Coroner Sara Hinchey to investigate . <p> But there has been conflict within Victoria police ever since a change to the pursuit policy was implemented in July 2015 . The change followed a review by coroner John Olle after the deaths of 14 people in almost five years in , or just after , pursuits . <p> The Police Association of Victoria strongly defends its members , with assistant secretary Bruce McKenzie making the point that the current pursuit policy is handcuffing police . Imagine for a moment just how difficult it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the public for " failing " to stop the tragedy . Of course , we all have perfect vision with the benefit of hindsight . <p> The only thing we can do in the wake of such tragedies is to try to learn from them . That is the only glimmer of hope in an otherwise truly dark chapter . 
 <p> An eerie pall has hung over Hanging Rock since Peter Weir 's film about an ill-fated school excursion was first released in 1975 . <p> The 700-metre high geological formation , situated a few kilometres from Mt Macedon , was the setting for his adaptation of Joan Lindsay 's novel Picnic at Hanging Rock , which details the fictional disappearance of schoolgirls Miranda , Marion and Irma on Valentine 's Day in 1900 . <p> A half-century since the novel 's release , a Melbourne artist is calling for the rock 's cinematic and literary history to be put aside in favour of its Indigenous past . <p> Amy Spiers said it was the public 's relationship to Hanging Rock visitors nearly always associated the site with missing schoolgirls and a sense of foreboding that was behind her Miranda Must Go campaign . <p> " I 've spoken to a lot of locals around the rock and they say they can always hear tourists yelling , ' Miranda ' , " Ms Spiers said . <p> " They said it was cute at first , but now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia 's obsession with the story was not only cause for noise complaints , but had left Hanging Rock 's Indigenous heritage to languish . <p> " Because of our neglect and our disregard , we 've managed to overlook those stories and not spent time and resources recovering them , " Ms Spiers said . <p> " When you put all this emphasis on a white fable , people are distracted . " <p> She said scar trees and traditional tools were among the historical finds at Hanging Rock . <h> Rock goes way back <p> Aboriginal history expert Jim Poulter said the rock was the land of the Gunung Willam Baluk clan , a place where the language was once the common tongue . <p> His great-grandfather was raised by the rock 's traditional owners and taken there to join in a male initiation ceremony in the mid-19th century . <p> Hanging Rock would have once been the place young men were taught traditional dances and underwent ritual scarring . <p> Mr Poulter welcomed Ms Spiers ' campaign and hoped those who visited the landmark could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " behavioural protocols of respect " for Hanging Rock . <p> " It would be great if non-Indigenous Australians could participate in these protocols , making an announcement at the base of the rock , ' We come in respect for this place ' , " he said . <p> Miranda Must Go is one of a growing number of grassroots campaigns around the world seeking to topple monuments to colonialism . In 2015 , South African students successfully argued a statue commemorating imperial politician and white supremacist Cecil Rhodes should be removed from their university grounds . <p> Debate continues in the United States about the future of a Thomas Jefferson statue erected at the former president 's alma mater . <p> Ms Spiers believed campaigns like hers would eventually result in a new date being chosen for Australia Day , saying so long as monuments to colonialism were preserved , so too would the perception that white people 's lives mattered more than those of people with coloured skin . <h> Tried and tested trope <p> The missing white person is a reappearing motif in Australian popular culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frederick McCubbin 's 19th century painting Lost , in which a forlorn child is seen disorientated in the bush . <p> The trope returns in film Walkabout , while real-life disappearances the Beaumont children , for example are still the stuff of tabloid interest . <p> But the white disappearing myth was a " toxic " one , Massey University associate professor Elspeth Tilley said , believing it was an effort to justify the principle of terra nullius or uncultivated land as reason for colonising Australia . <p> " It 's not a politically innocent narrative , " she said . " The first thing that every vanishing story does is paint the land as a wildness . <p> " The characters ' fear justified the flattening of the bush or the putting in of a road , creating a landscape that was more European . " <p> These vanishing myths -- Dr Tilley found more than 250 during her investigation also portray women and Indigenous Australians in stereotypical ways , as helpless victims and noble savages respectively . <p> " It 's a harmful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retelling , " she said . <p> Dr Tilley will premiere a short satire of Picnic at Hanging Rock on February 14 ; Ms Spiers intentionally chose the the same date as the one on which Joan Lindsay set her story . <p> ' Miranda lovers ' , the term the artist has given to fanatics of Picnic at Hanging Rock , were taken aback by the plan . <p> But she maintained putting Indigenous stories first did not mean the Rock could no longer be a recreation hub for everyone . <p> " Everyone can admit that white Australians are attracted to Hanging Rock for same reasons as Indigenous people : it 's a fantastic place to hang out , a great venue for sporting events and enjoying a day with your family . <p> " It 's fine to enjoy Hanging Rock , we should just enjoy it with an understanding of what it means .

 <h> Readers ' tips and advice : If you can afford to travel , you can afford insurance <h> BITTER PILLS <p> If you can afford to travel you can afford insurance , an essential part of every holiday , and it can alleviate unnecessary worry if things go wrong . <p> Many travellers require daily medication in one form or another ; I 've often heard when there have been unforseen delays or an accident that people only have enough medication for just the specified time of travel . <p> Please take an extra week 's supply or more ; it can be difficult to locate a doctor or pharmacist to prescribe the correct medication in a strange city . Those few extra ounces of weight could be life saving . <p> Charmain Williams , Forster , NSW <h> VULTURE CULTURE <p> I recently visited Pokhara , Nepal for a short break and by recommendation from a friend , booked a tandem paragliding flight with the Parahawking Project ( a British NGO ) .

Peter and Pat Lacey were wonderful hosts and by following the mud map provided we saw all the places , plus many more , mentioned in Lee 's article . <p> The rock art was magnificent and I hope strict , enforceable regulations are in place to protect the sites .

 <h> RSL saves its fence in Wedderburn after planning tribunal ruling <p> The fence which runs along the perimeter of Wedderburn 's soldier 's memorial park - the source of a dispute between the local RSL branch and Loddon Shire Council . <p> Korong Vale RSL has managed to save a small fence which borders the town 's soldier 's memorial park , after the state 's planning tribunal rejected a Loddon Shire plan to remove it . <p> The council planned to knock down the fence during the construction of the Wedderburn streetscape project , which will include new landscaping , footpaths , surfaces and changes to nearby roads . <p> Grading works would have obscured the bottom of the fence , the council submitted , and changing the plans would be too costly . <p> The matter appeared before the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal last week , where the presiding VCAT member ruled " an engineering solution can always be found " , and ordered Loddon Shire to amend their plans to keep the fence . <p> The fence described as " low openwork " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shortly after the memorial gates were added to the reserve , also known as Jacka Park . <p> A council heritage adviser found the fence formed a " package " with the gates the basis for VCAT 's decision to keep it . <p> Loddon Shire used the evidence of heritage historian Aron Paul to argue the fence did not meet the threshold of significance to be protected under an overlay , and did not meet the quality of the granite gates . <p> The adjoining granite gates . VCAT ruled the fence and gates form part of a " package " at the soldier 's memorial park . <p> Dr Paul said its removal would not adversely impact the cultural heritage of the park . <p> VCAT senior member Jeanette Rickards said the gates and memorial were the critical elements of the park , but the fence also provided a " link " between the gates and statue . <p> " The removal of the fence would in my view result in an adverse impact on the significance of these structures , " she said in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park is clearly marked with the fence between the memorial gates with the wider area of the park containing the Soldiers Memorial as well as Bert Hinkler 's Lamp , the bandstand and sculpture . <p> " I will therefore allow the granting of a permit but with a modified Condition 1 that requires not only amended plans to show the retention of the fence but also changes to the design details to ensure the plinth of the fence is not obscured .

 <p> A plant not seen alive for almost two centuries has been found at the Moorebank Intermodal site but the find was revealed only after Stage 1 was approved . <p> Approval was granted prior to the plant being recognised as endangered so the approval stands . <p> Planning approval was granted in March 2014 , subject to a search for endangered species . Species of hibbertia , or guinea flower , had been found in a Holsworthy military area survey as far back as November 1999 but not identified as the extinct variety . <p> Stage 1 of the Intermodal was approved on Monday , December 12 and announced the following Wednesday . <p> Two days later , on the Friday , the hibbertia species was provisionally listed as the critically-endangered fumana four days too late to stall the approval process . <p> The federal Environment department said in a statement that " new species listings do not affect pre-existing approvals " . <p> Greg Hunt , the former federal environment minister , gave planning approval to the SIMTA Moorebank Intermodal terminal in March 2014 but imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search " for an endangered species of hibbertia flowering plants . <p> The search instead found 370 individuals of the hibbertia fumana species on the seven-hectare site , formerly owned by the military and largely untouched . <p> The plant was thought to be extinct and last documented in 1823 . It was only named in 2012 as a separate species from pressed specimens held in overseas vaults . <p> " Finding a species thought to be extinct is not something many scientists get to do in a lifetime so this is an exciting discovery for everyone involved , " said Jane Rodd , a senior ecologist with Arcadis , the consultancy hired to do the search . <p> Why is this plant important ? <p> It 's remarkable to go out in Western Sydney and see a plant that may not exist anywhere else on earth . <p> One of the insiders interviewed for this story , who asked not to be named , said : " It 's unique , it has a value and a right to exist . It 's remarkable to go out in Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else on earth . <p> " The flower is about the size of a 50c piece . The function of this plant is mostly unknown , but insects , including bees , rely on it . A traditional bee ca n't pollinate this one . " <p> But rather than trumpet the rediscovery , claims from within the Office of Environment &amp; Heritage have arisen that staff were told to keep the finding a secret until the Intermodal won approval which it did from the Planning Assessment Commission on December 12 last year . <p> Mark Speakman , the environment minister until the appointment of Gladys Berejiklian as the new premier , said he was unaware of the flower 's status . <p> " Neither I nor my office gave , or was aware of any , direction about dealing with any discovery of hibbertia fumana at the Moorebank site , " he said . <p> An Environment spokesman said it was not his department 's role to inform the planning commission of the fumana rediscovery . <p> Despite the federal demand for a study , the planning commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant was granted a " critically endangered " emergency listing by the NSW Scientific Committee four days after the planning commission ruling . <p> " This area of bushland where the plants have been found is proposed to be set aside as a biobanking site as part of the adjacent development , " the Environment spokesman said . <p> " The species has only been found on the proposed biobanking site and not in the development footprint , " he said , adding the government was working with the alliance behind SIMTA and the Commonwealth " to ensure the security of the plants " . <p> On behalf of the Intermodal , a SIMTA spokesman dismissed a claim the proposed development would run through some of the hibbertia plants . He released this chart showing the plants falling within a proposed conservation area : <p> Map showing the hibbertia fumana plants in relation to the Intermodal development and the existing disused railway line . Map : supplied on behalf of SIMTA <p> " The simple fact is not one of the 370 hibbertia fumana plants our ecologists discovered is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The entire population is on adjacent bushland already set aside for conservation . <p> " There is no threat to this rare herb on our site . Its protection and ongoing management are guaranteed under plans being developed with state and federal environment agencies . <p> " Thanks to flora surveys done as part of the Moorebank development , a plant last seen in the 1820s is back from presumed extinction and its future protected . We think that is a very good thing and are pleased to have played a part . " <p> Wayne Olling , secretary of the Cumberland Conservation Network , said the government should let outside groups such as his own examine whether the plants would indeed be secure . <p> " Here 's an opportunity to save a species that we thought was lost and now found , " he said . " The NSW government should have informed the PAC that there was a significant finding . Given all the concealment that 's taken place so far we have no confidence in what they say . " <p> Labor , the Greens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reviewed after the finding of the rare plant . <p> " Any attempt to withhold information during the planning process is a very serious matter , " said Penny Sharpe , Labor 's environment spokeswoman , adding Minister Speakman " must publicly guarantee that there has not been any interference in the planning process either directed by his office or his department " . <p> Mehreen Faruqi <p> Mehreen Faruqi , the Greens environment spokeswoman , said there was " something very dodgy " about this whole thing . " We need to know who knew what and when as well as how the project was approved just a few days before this critically endangered species was listed , " Ms Faruqi said . <p> There 's something very dodgy about this whole thing .

" <p> Kate Smolski , chief executive of the conservation council , said it was unacceptable that the federal government approved projects before the full environmental impacts were known and a stop-work should now be imposed on the project . <p> The process also revealed " systemic failures " on the part of the NSW planning system , she said . <p> " The government should also explain why it took until mid-December to list the species as critically endangered when it was rediscovered on the site more than a month earlier , " Ms Smolski said . <p> " It is hard to avoid the conclusion the NSW government delayed listing the species to ensure the project went ahead as scheduled . " <p> Greens spokeswoman Signe Westerberg . Picture : Anna Warr <p> Local Greens spokeswoman Signe Westerberg said : " What right has the government got in delaying any findings ? We need the best outcome for the whole community for humans , for fauna and for flora ! <p> " I 'm pretty disgusted .

How can it be a biobank if it has a railway line through it ? - Signe Westerberg , Greens spokeswoman <p> The federal Environment department , though , echoed comments of its state counterparts , saying that no fumana plants were within the development site . <p> An offset site is being prepared so that the fumana " are not impacted by the project and will be protected in perpetuity " , the department said in a statement . <p> Since the plant was not listed as it was thought to be extinct its discovery " will not trigger any review of the project 's approval " , the government said , and " new species listings do not affect pre-existing approvals " . 
 <p> " The Australian Federal Police can confirm it arrested a 42-year-old man in the Melbourne suburb of Williamstown on Monday , January 30 , " the Australian Federal Police said . <p> The arrest comes just days before Attorney-General George Brandis , Justice Minister Michael Keenan and Minister for Defence Personnel Dan Tehan are scheduled to attend the Ministerial Council on Law and Security in Jakarta . <p> On January 26 , Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said a parliamentary commission requested the Australian government legally process the trespassing incident " because we know the faces of perpetrators , we have the pictures " . <p> The incident featured a demonstrator waving the separatist West Papuan " Morning Star " flag , which is banned in Indonesia , while another person filmed the event . The video was posted on Facebook and distributed widely . <p> " The question is why has there been no arrest when 20 days have passed ? " Ms Retno said on January 26 . <p> " As close neighbouring countries , we have a very intense relationship and of course problems occur every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another MP - Tubagus - went further than Ms Retno , saying Indonesia could take diplomatic measures if no legal action was taken . <p> Many Indonesians remain suspicious of Australia 's intentions in Papua , even though it has signed the Lombok Treaty recognising Indonesian sovereignty over the restive province . <p> However the Indonesian Foreign Ministry stressed its concern was the trespass , which Ms Retno described as a criminal act that was " completely intolerable " . <p> The AFP spokesman said the man had been charged with trespass of a protected premises , contrary to section 20 of the Protection of Persons and Property Act 1971 . <p> Under the act , a person who trespasses on protected premises commits an offence , punishable on conviction by a fine of not more than 10 penalty units ( $1800 ) . <p> The man has been bailed to appear in the Melbourne Magistrates Court on February 23 . <p> " As the matter is now before the court it would not be appropriate to provide any further comment , " the AFP spokesperson said . 
 <h> Bendigo punters fork out millions on gambling <p> 1 Feb 2017 , 3 p.m . <p> Punters in Bendigo lost more than $25 million to pokies in the first half of the 2016-17 financial year . <p> Poker machine revenue in Bendigo fell slightly during the past six months , but punters in the city still lost more than $25 million to the one-armed bandits in the first half of the 2016-17 financial year . <p> The biggest losses were incurred via the All Seasons Hotel 's 100 gaming machine licences , where more than $5.1 million was frittered away , followed by the Bendigo District RSL where pokies contributed more than $3.6 million to the club 's bottom line . <p> All up the machines produced in revenue for the 11 licensed venues in Bendigo , compared with for the same period in 2015-16 . <p> A 2010 Productivity Commission report attributed 40 per cent of total poker machine losses to problem gamblers , despite them making up just 15 per cent of regular players , which if applied to the figures in Bendigo would equate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred players . <p> The Productivity Commission also noted the risks of problem gambling were low for people who only played lotteries and scratchies , but rose steeply with the frequency of gambling on table games , wagering and especially gaming machines . <p> The Bendigo District RSL returned of pokies revenue to the community in 2015-16 in the form of donations , gifts and sponsorship , including in advice and support services for ex-service personnel , their carers and families . <p> The Bendigo Stadium 's principal charitable use for the money was on sporting and recreational activities , for which it forked out last financial year . <p> Bendigo has seven poker machines for every 1000 adults who live in the city . <p> In 2015-16 , Victorians lost $2.6 billion on poker machines across the state , $44.7 million more than the previous year . <p> Other Bendigo venues to reap millions in gambling revenue in the second half of last year were : <p> The City Family Hotel : <p> The Kangaroo Flat Sports Club : <p> The Rising Sun Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bendigo Club : <p> The Borough Club : <p> The Foundry Hotel : <p> The Windermere Hotel : <p> The All Seasons and Bendigo District RSL were contacted for comment but were unavailable by deadline . 
 <p> Seven victims still remain in hospitals , with one of them in a grave condition . <p> In the days since , the scene of the tragedy was turned into a makeshift memorial as Melburnians left flowers , cards , candles , soft toys and wreaths . <p> On Tuesday , " the monument to life " was cleared away , with the cards to be preserved and the organic material to be composted and , eventually , added to the Victims of Crime memorial near State Parliament . <p> The soft toys have been taken in by City of Melbourne 's Citywide to be cleaned . There is talk of donating them to charities and to the Royal Children 's Hospital . <p> Most of the charities Fairfax Media talked to would n't speak on the record , but seemed reluctant to sell them in their stores . <p> Some suggested preserving them as part of a public monument . <p> The Royal Children 's Hospital referred us to their foundation which is in charge of accepting donations . <p> The foundation 's chief executive Sue Hunt said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toys due to infection control " . <p> " All toys donated to the hospital need to be new and unused to ensure patient safety , " Ms Hunt said . <p> Salvos Stores chief executive Matt Davis said it was a very sensitive matter and had to be dealt with with the right level of compassion and dignity . <p> He said they would n't sell the donated toys at their stores . <p> " If we were approached , we would work to find a solution where we could ensure the right recipient were receiving them , ' Mr Davis said . <p> " We would love to find a suitable recipient ... and ensure that it met with the necessary compassion and dignity to the donor , to the people who have passed away and the recipient .

 <p> Bendigo Theatre Company is prepared to light its stage up like never before . <p> The theatre company received a $9145 grant as part of the federal government 's Stronger Communities Programme . <p> A new lighting and sound board has expanded the possibilities at BTC 's Arts Shed in Golden Square . <p> BTC president John Murray said the company will be able to teach the next generation of stage hands the finer points of lighting design . <p> " The big advantage is we now have the facility not just to teach young people how to use the lighting decks but actually move them into lighting design which is really exciting , " he said . <p> " Lighting is one of the forgotten arts of theatre , many shows can live or die on lighting . It 's an art in itself . <p> " A number of people around are interested and now we have the facility to further their skills . " <p> The new equipment was used for the first time as part of BTC 's summer pantomime Aladdin . <p> Mr Murray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shows possible at the Arts Shed . <p> " It makes the shed a much more flexible space and as a consequence we are able to expand the types of shows we can do , " he said . <p> Member for Bendigo Lisa Chesters was in the audience at the Aladdin and able to see equipment in action . <p> " The Arts Shed has always been a fantastic space for locals to get hands on experience in all facets of community theatre , " she said . <p> " This new equipment opens up even more opportunity for anyone interested in getting involved with theatre production . <p> " I am really excited to learn that it was two young people , Ian and Eddie , who were able to get hands on training with this equipment to create the lighting and sound for the BTC 's production of Aladdin .

 <h> Kasey fights for right to play country <p> At the 2015 ARIA Awards , hall of fame inductee Tina Arena demanded commercial radio pay more attention to female singers who passed the milestone age . <p> Madonna used her acceptance speech at a Billboard women in music event last year to lambaste those who bullied her for , as she put it , simply " around " . <p> But age and gender have never felt like hurdles for Kasey Chambers . <p> Australia 's undisputed queen of the country music genre has just scored her fifth number one album at 40 with two-disc LP Dragonfly . <p> She is also on a 10-date tour alongside Powderfinger frontman Bernard Fanning that will stop off in Bendigo later this month . <p> The real challenge , she said , was getting country music onto the public 's playlist . <p> " It 's probably been harder for me playing the style of music I play than anything to do with being a woman or being over 40 , " Chambers said . <p> It took breakthrough single Not Pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit play on country music , to win mainstream affection . <p> But fans of the song have stuck by her ever since . <p> " They 've all grown up with me , a lot of the girls who felt not pretty enough at the time , " she said . <p> " Now they 're 40-year-old women like me still having days when they feel not pretty enough , like we all do . " <p> Despite always returning to some of her first and favourite songs a gig has never gone by without a rendition of The Captain Chambers believes she is a better songwriter now than ever before . <p> " Everyone should feel like they 're doing their best work at this point in their life , " she said , pointing to album track The Ballad of Henri Young as evidence of her maturing craft . <p> The song details the life of a pickpocket sent to Alcatraz , the same story as the 1995 Kevin Bacon film Murder in the First . <p> Despite seeing the movie as a teenager , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story to music . <p> And yet many of her songs simply " fall out " , like lead single Ai n't No Little Girl . <p> " I like to think I have more control over them ( the songs ) than I do , " she said . <p> " But I 'm glad some of the songs just write themselves . <p> " I do n't ever want songwriting to feel like a job . " <p> While still sounding deeply personal , pop culture references abound on Dragonfly the autobiographical Talkin ' Baby Blues somehow works Twisted Sister , The Sopranos and Kanye West into five minutes -- as do nods to literature and the Bible . <p> The references are a relic of a childhood spent in a " quite strict " Seventh Day Adventist family whose musical diet was dominated by gospel-tinged country artists . <p> Today Chambers describes herself as a " believer of stuff " not affiliated with any particular religion . She said the liturgical lyrics were more style than substance . <p> " I like the way that language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . <p> " I pick up a banjo and play it in a minor key and I feel like I just want to use biblical terms . " <p> The upcoming concert series will the be the first time fans hear some of the new songs live , but Chambers also promised audiences they will witness duets between her and Fanning . <p> Their first show together was just last week at the Tamworth Country Music Festival but the pair already have a long history of singing on one another 's albums , most notably the title track of Chambers ' 10th studio album , Bittersweet . <p> She has even released a cover of the Powderfinger hit These Days . <p> Chambers ' admiration for Fanning boils down to his artistic self-determination . <p> " I love Bernard 's approach to music , because he plays music for all the right reasons , " she said . <p> " He 's not dictated to by anyone else : trends , audiences . <p> " He 's just him and he owns that .

 <p> In most years there 's room for one forecaster of the year . But not in 2016 . Hardly any of our panel picked the dive in Australia 's growth rate to 1.8 per cent or the dive in the cash rate to a record-low 1.5 per cent . Wage growth was lower than all but the most pessimistic of the forecasts , and house prices ended the year far higher than the highest . <p> In most years there 's room for one forecaster of the year . But not in 2016 . Hardly any of our panel picked the dive in Australia 's growth rate to 1.8 per cent or the dive in the cash rate to a record-low 1.5 per cent . Wage growth was lower than all but the most pessimistic of the forecasts , and house prices ended the year far higher than the highest . <p> Stephen Anthony of Industry Super ( a two-time forecaster of the year ) was right about Australia 's very low economic growth rate . He picked 2 per cent for the year to December . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five who expected it to slip 1.5 per cent . And he was right about the timing . He predicted one cut in the first half of 2016 and one in the second . <p> But like most he was far too cautious on house prices ( expecting growth of only 3.5 per cent in Sydney and 6.5 per cent in Melbourne ) , far too keen on a low dollar ( expecting 62 US cents instead of 72 ) and pessimistic about commodity prices , expecting a slide in the iron ore price to $US33 . In fairness , few people expected the late-year surge in commodity prices , and none of our panel . <p> The ANU 's Renee Fry-McKibbin got house prices pretty right . The typical forecast was for the CoreLogic measure of Sydney prices to climb 2 per cent and for the Melbourne measure 3 per cent . The year ended with prices up 15.5 per cent and 13.7 per cent . The Housing Industry Association and the property specialist BIS Shrapnel were as wrong as the rest of them , picking around 6 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent and 9 per cent , and she got housing investment pretty right as well . <p> She says with money cheap she could see nothing that would slow prices down . New home building was high but it takes a while , and a while to provide infrastructure to new suburbs . This year she is going for 12 per cent and 10 per cent . <p> Bill Mitchell of Newcastle University 's Centre of Full Employment and Equity is the third of this year 's three-pack . He was darn close on Australian economic growth , the closest on US economic growth , and the closest on record-low wage growth , picking an ultra low 2 per cent , close to the 1.9 per cent recorded in the year to September . He also hit the bullseye on the 10-year bond rate , picking 2.7 per cent , which is where it ended up . <p> He says low wage growth would have been obvious to anyone who was n't seduced by the fairly steady unemployment rate . Underemployment had been climbing , tens of thousands of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and what jobs growth there was had been concentrated in part-time jobs that were typically non-unionised where workers had low bargaining power . This year he is predicting wage growth of 1.8 per cent , less than the rate of inflation , meaning earning power will shrink . <p> He says the low bond rate was also obvious , given auction data showing queues of traders wanting to buy risk-free assets . For all the talk about the need to attract foreign capital , Australia 's government finds it pretty easy . <p> There are three honourable mentions : Shane Oliver was also close on wages , Jakob Madsen was spot on in predicting an outsized fall in mining investment of 40 per cent , and Stephen Koukoulas had the highest iron ore price . At $US58 a tonne it was higher than anyone else 's , but still far short of what happened . <p> Arise Bill , Stephen and Renee , and may one of you not need to split the award next time . 
 <h> Why you should still visit the US despite President Trump <p> There is this country it 's the best country . It 's beautiful . Everyone agrees . It 's so great that you 're gon na get sick of its greatness . Believe me . <p> This country is , of course , the US , which now exists in a Trumpian dystopia where everything is " yuge " and it wins " bigly " , even though everyone is apparently unemployed and the streets are war zones , and you have to get used to the fact that the most powerful man in the country , and effectively on the entire planet , tweets insane boasts like a 12-year-old with self-esteem issues . <p> But this is modern-day America . When Donald Trump announced in his inauguration speech that everything was about to change , he was n't kidding . For better or worse , things will never be the same in the US again . <p> I was there for the transition . I was in the US for inauguration day , to see kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a man who seems , to me at least , to be the polar opposite of those things . And I was n't alone in this thought , apparently . <p> Chairlifts at ski resorts are usually politics-free zones , where chitchat is limited to " where are you from , what do you do , and where are the powder stashes on the mountain " , but not on inauguration day . It was all Trump , all the time , and it turns out that you do n't meet many people in Beaver Creek , Colorado , who voted for the Orange One . <p> In fact , no one I 've met in the US so far will put their hand up and admit they support this guy . And yet here we are , with the man in power . " It 's gon na be ... interesting , " one guy said to me on the chairlift . " Let 's call it interesting . " <p> It might be enough to put you off visiting the US . It might be enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy ideas , to hear the descriptions of a broken , miserable country , to feel the deep sense of nationalism that pervades everything Trump has to say , and consider not visiting the US any more . <p> This new attitude of ultra-patriotism is likely to make American grate again . Why go to a violent country full of people who clearly have no interest in us as citizens of the rest of the world ? <p> But that would be a mistake . Because anyone who 's been to the US would be able to tell you that the version of America preached in Trump 's speeches is not the version of America that any traveller would encounter . <p> This is n't a nation of chest-thumping xenophobes , even if it 's being represented by one . This is a country of kind , hospitable , intelligent and friendly people who will love you for your foreign accent , rather than shun you for being different . And they live in a peaceful , beautiful country . <p> The vision that President Trump describes , an America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misery , is not one that seems to have any basis in truth or reality . In Beaver Creek , Colorado though it 's probably not representative of the nation as a whole the only " American carnage " I saw was on the beginners ' ski slope . <p> Even outside of that winter paradise , life in the US did n't seem so bad . Certainly , the people I met did n't think so . " I do n't know what that place is that Trump was talking about , " one guy said to me . " But I 'm glad I do n't live there . " <p> It would be a travesty if tourists were turned off visiting the US because of the new Trumpian reality . You ca n't judge a country by its leader . A politician is n't a people . <p> The travel experience in the US will be the same as it ever was , despite the rise of Trump . Los Angeles will always be a fantasy land . New York will always be brash and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas . The Rocky Mountains will still get their snow . The sky will be as big as ever over Montana . <p> The only difference you might find in Trumpian US is that people start going out of their way to prove that you ca n't judge a book by its extravagantly coiffed cover . These will be protests on a micro scale , small acts of kindness and good will towards strangers that travellers will be able to enjoy . <p> Remember , the US is " yuge " , and most people who live there did not vote for Trump . 
 <p> She travels the world as one of Australia 's most successful professional surfers , but Felicity Palmateer does not have the freedom to post whenever and however she likes because of online " creeps " . <p> The big wave surfer , 24 , has an avid Instagram following of more than 135,000 followers , who like to keep up with the sportswoman 's carefree snaps in eye-watering , beach destinations , usually sporting the latest in Billabong swimwear . But she told Fairfax Media she has learnt to keep " everything pretty filtered " . <p> " I do n't try to give too much away . One thing I do is that I do n't really post in real-time where I am , there 's too many creeps out there , " the Braun ambassador said . <p> " Snapchat especially , I just do n't want people knowing where I am every second of the day . I sometimes make a video on my Snapchat and post it a few hours later . <p> " I 've been travelling and competing since I was 17 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am doing , but it 's still good to take those precautions . " <p> The Perth-born , Gold Coast-based competitor , who took the record for the biggest wave ever surfed by an Australian woman from Layne Beachley two years ago , said it 's only when she 's travelling that she takes the extra safety measures . Giving no heed to trolls also helps . <p> " You always do have those keyboard warriors but it does n't faze me any more , " she said . " It used to make me really upset . I do n't care any more . I know the majority of people like what I am doing . " <p> Apart from location , she also likes to keep her boyfriend , who also doubles as her manager , to herself . <p> " I do n't really want people knowing my really personal stuff . I try to keep it pretty fun and just light-hearted , " she said . <p> While Palmateer , who is also an advocate for marine conservation and an artist on the side , feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I feel like that with every sport " ) , she said the future was bright for women trying to catch their big beach break . <p> " Women 's prize money just got doubled two years ago and being in it for so long now I can only see positive things for the future of women 's surfing . " <p> Palmateer , an ambassador for Braun , known as " Flick " to her friends , says she does n't put too much pressure on herself to look a certain way - even though her wardrobe staple is a bikini . <p> " When I look good I feel good , " she said . However she would never consider professional modelling . " I have too many bruises . "

Picture : Supplied <p> A close friendship between a Chinese billionaire and a Newcastle family has led to the largest ever donation to the University of Newcastle in NSW . <p> Jack Ma , the founder of the internet company Alibaba , will give US$20 million , or more than Australian $26 million , to fund a scholarship program . <p> Mr Ma has travelled to Newcastle to announce the scholarship program in a ceremony late Friday afternoon . <p> " That he views this as so significant , so important to him , that he would personally come to be here is a really strong symbol , " the University of Newcastle 's Vice-Chancellor , Professor Caroline McMillen , said . <p> The donation by the man estimated by Forbes to be worth US$28.4 billion , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship with Newcastle 's Morley family , who he met as a teenager in his home city of Hangzhou in 1980 . He approached a boy about his age , David Morley , to practice his English , and from there a bond with the family grew . <p> The Morleys brought Jack Ma to Australia in 1985 for his first visit . Mr Ma has credited the father , Ken Morley , with being an influential figure in his life , and he has returned to Newcastle to see the family several times , including a visit to an ailing Mr Morley prior to his death in 2004 . <p> " I am very thankful for Australia and the time I spent there in my youth , " Mr Ma said in a statement before the ceremony . " The culture , the landscape and most importantly its people had a profound positive impact on my view of the world at that time . " <p> " To honour the experience and the special relationship I formed with the Morley family , the Jack Ma Foundation is delighted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , educate and cultivate tomorrow 's leaders . " <p> Professor McMillen said the university had been working with the Jack Ma Foundation for about a year to shape a program " that really represents the quality of that friendship , that really unique friendship , between Jack Ma and Ken Morley " . <p> When The Ma and Morley Scholarship Program reached full capacity , it would support 90 students a year . The program would be advertised from the middle of this year , and Professor McMillen said the recipients would include students from financially disadvantaged backgrounds and indigenous scholars . <p> " At the heart of this philanthropic commitment is the most remarkable story of friendship , " Professor McMillen said . <p> David Morley said his father " would be moved to tears " by Jack Ma 's donation , and the reasons behind it .

Send your letters to **28;193;TOOLONG . <h> Diabetes plan imperative <p> A lack of a clear , consistent national approach to supporting children with diabetes at school means the parents of more than 11,300 Australian students with diabetes are enduring an anxious start to the school year . <p> If not treated appropriately type 1 diabetes can pose immediate life-threatening health risks and must be considered with the same seriousness as acute asthma attacks and anaphylaxis . <p> Diabetes Australia is concerned that many schools do not properly plan and prepare to provide a safe and supportive environment for children with type 1 diabetes . This means children may miss out on normal activities and learning opportunities . They may also experience stigma , distress and discrimination . There are other serious health concerns around missing necessary insulin doses and being at a greater risk from dangerous low blood glucose levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fundamental right to a normal school experience , including full participation in all educational , extracurricular and sporting activities and it is important schools provide the support needed to ensure this happens . <p> Many parents and families are very worried about the school environment and how their children can have a normal school experience without the stigma and issues often associated with insulin injections , checking blood glucose levels and managing possible hypos . <p> It 's 95 years since the first child received an insulin injection in 1922 and in all that time we have n't seen any real improvement . Surely after 95 years we should expect that insulin injections , blood glucose monitoring and appropriate diabetes management can happen at any school ? <p> Diabetes Australia is writing to all Members of Parliament and ministers at the national and state and territory level , calling on them to support a much stronger , nationally consistent approach . <h> A/Professor Greg Johnson , Diabetes Australia CEO <h> Mobile review concern <p> My parents and broader family have always lived in regional Victoria and almost all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up seeing that hard work and a little healthy competition was what made you succeed . More importantly , it also provided customers with the best possible outcome . This is why I am concerned by the ACCC 's review into regulated mobile roaming in the Australian market . <p> I can understand , the idea of regulated roaming looks good . People tell me it will provide regional communities with better priced services , increased coverage and choice . However when you work through the details you can see who really wins and who loses . <p> On price we charge the same prices across the country , so regional customers have benefited from price reductions and data growth that is being driven by metro competition . Regulated mobile roaming will not increase coverage in regional area by one square kilometre . The fact is , the costs of supplying regional coverage are not recovered from regional customers . Setup costs for a tower in a remote area could be as high as one million dollars , with tens of thousands each year for maintenance . <p> Over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mobile access network has gone to provide services to the most remote two per cent of the population . <p> In remote and regional parts of Victoria coverage is the most important issue . In their submission to the ACCC , the Alpine Shire Council said that any short-term benefit from regulated roaming would be outweighed by the long-term negative impacts . <p> Allowing our competitors to use the Telstra network in areas where we have invested to provide coverage ( and they have not ) would remove the competitive advantage . We believe our competitors should have a crack and put their money where their mouth is . <h> Steve Tinker , Telstra area general manager for northern and western Victoria 
 <p> INCREASED use of lockdowns and continued staffing issues were among a " significant range of pressures " placed on staff and young people at Malmsbury Youth Justice Centre in the lead-up to several riots in the last month . <p> Victorian Ombudsman Deborah Glass released a report on Monday on the state 's youth justice facilities at Malmsbury , Parkville and the Grevillea Unit at Barwon Prison . <p> The report detailed the deterioration of conditions at Malmsbury in the aftermath of the riot at Parkville in November , including young people kept in their rooms up to 23 hours per day for two weeks , beds without mattresses or bedding , and no toilet paper or clean clothing . <p> Ombudsman officers and staff from the Commission for Children and Young People visited Malmsbury on multiple occasions just days before four young people caused extensive property damage on January 12 . <p> Fifteen prisoners then broke out of the centre on January 26 when they attacked a staff member and stole a security pass . <p> In her report , Ms Glass said a range of issues were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The issues were most acute in the fortnight immediately after the riot , but some continue to be of concern in January 2017 when staffing issues continued to cause unit lockdowns , " she wrote . <p> " It was apparent on those visits that young people and staff at Malmsbury were dealing with a significant range of pressures in the aftermath of the events at Parkville in November . " <p> The report described " inappropriate sleeping arrangements " , the closure of the centre 's visitor centre , damage to the " education hub " , confusion about prisoner 's placement arrangements , delays in administering medication and graffiti . <p> Prisoners at Malmsbury continued to contact the Victorian Ombudsman after the visits to complain about the amount of hours they were placed in lockdown . <p> During a court hearing in Bendigo for four prisoners charged with criminal damage in January , Malmsbury Youth Justice Centre operations manager Rick Madigan was questioned about the use of lockdowns at the facility . <p> He said they were used " once a week " in rotation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lockdown is actually a rotation scenario , four out on each wing eight at a time clients still maintain coming out of rooms , TV , meals , " Mr Madigan said . <p> He outlined the centre 's procedures for dealing with poor behaviour . <p> Prisoners are placed on individual behaviour management plans , which last for 72 hours and involve periods of isolation . <p> A further measure can be put in place if poor behaviour continues , involving 23 hours of isolation over three days . They are then re-assessed and , if over 18 , they can be assessed for their suitability to be kept in youth detention . <p> Mr Madigan said they were not long-term solutions . <p> " I believe isolation is n't a long-term solution for the clients , it 's a short-term solution to get them back on track , " he said . <p> " It 's not healthy for anyone to be in isolation . " <p> In September , WorkSafe issued an improvement notice on the Malmsbury facility in response to 41 incidents of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Community and Public Sector Union blamed " overcrowding " for the situation , and was critical of the increased number of young people being placed on remand in the centre . <p> Staff from the Commission for Children and Young People will continue to visit Malmsbury every month and raise concerns with government . <p> Ms Glass said an outcome needed to be found which prevented young people from becoming adult criminals . <p> " It is neither in the interests of public safety nor the public purse for young people to become entrenched in a life of crime , cycling through youth justice centres into adult prisons to which all too often they return , " she said . <p> " Reform should not be derailed by knee-jerk responses to events , which will not make us safer in the long run .

 <p> A cruise ship stuck in Melbourne at Station Pier is seaworthy despite two system failures in less than a month , its operator says . <p> Norwegian Star passengers have been delayed and some have abandoned their dream cruise to New Zealand after the propulsion system stopped functioning on Friday off Wilsons Promontory on a multi-stop cruise to New Zealand . <p> The crippled vessel was dragged by tug boats to Port Melbourne 's Station Pier early on Sunday morning . <p> A spokeswoman for operator Norwegian Cruise Line defended the ship . <p> " There is no safety issue in relation to this ship ; the issue is speed , " she said . <p> The spokeswoman said the ship had not lost power , and all services were still operating on board ; the problem lay solely with the propulsion system . <p> The system earlier struck trouble on a journey between Hong Kong and Indonesia on January 16 . <p> It was unusual to have two propulsion system failures and it was not yet clear whether the incidents were related , the spokeswoman said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including Milford Sound in New Zealand . <p> The spokeswoman said passengers were aware of the shortened trip . She said they had been getting hourly updates from the captain and that the operator expected to arrive in Auckland on time , on February 18 , but more stops might still be cancelled . <p> Engineering crews were inspecting the fault . <p> " In terms of fixing it , I understand it is not a complicated fix . It is a matter of parts . It is not like you can go down to Bunnings and get these parts , " she said <p> About 10 per cent of the 2000 passengers on board had decided to leave the ship . <p> All passengers have been offered a full refund , plus 50 per cent off their next Norwegian Cruise Line cruise , regardless of whether they stay aboard or leave . <p> Passengers who abandon the cruise will also receive $350 per person for flights to New Zealand and $300 per ticket to compensate for flight rescheduling penalties . <p> Passengers disembarking were preparing to either abandon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repairs . <p> US couple Trevor and Ashley Wagner were cutting their losses and booked a flight back home on Sunday morning . <p> " It was n't as desperate as some people were saying but it was very disappointing , " Ms Wagner said . <p> " We figured we would save the vacation time and take the trip again another time . " <p> Mr Wagner said the Norwegian Star operator 's offer of flights to New Zealand was not the dream trip they had planned . <p> They will rebook the trip another time , he said . <p> " We were two days at sea and were supposed to see New Zealand , " Mr Wagner said . " We are cutting and running .

 <h> Questions raised after Outback Obstacles event fails to deliver on promises in Bendigo <p> Organiser says he will deliver on promises after participants complain about the event . <p> QUESTIONS : Part of the Outback Obstacles course at Bendigo 's Prince of Wales Showgrounds , which has disappointed several attendees . <p> QUESTIONS have been raised about the legitimacy of an obstacle course event held at the weekend after participants failed to receive promised merchandise , although the organiser has assured it will be in their hands this week . <p> Outback Obstacles , an event for people aged 12 and over , was held in Bendigo on Sunday at the Prince of Wales Showgrounds . <p> Included in the ticket price which was $79 for adults and $49 for children , with a $3 booking fee was a T-shirt , hat , finishing medal and water bottle . <p> But the Bendigo Advertiser heard from several participants who said they were not given these items and were told inconsistent stories of when and how they would receive them . <p> Some said they were told when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchandise packs would be available at the course . <p> But Brooke Garner said she was told upon completion of the course that the merchandise would be available at 7am Monday . <p> Another participant said her friends tried to pick it up on Friday and were told the truck was half an hour away , and were told the same thing on Sunday . <p> Event director Dan Gold said the delay was due to an issue with the courier and attendees could expect the promised merchandise in the mail by Wednesday or Thursday . <p> He said despite paying for express shipping , the merchandise did not clear customs in time , and he felt " horrible " having to tell people he could not yet deliver on what had been promised . <p> But it is not the first time people have complained of this issue : on the event 's Facebook page , people have reported this occurred at the Orange event last month . <p> Participant Sue Willcock said she also held safety concerns about the event , having seen no first aid officers or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questioned the quality of the obstacles , saying they were unsteady . <p> Her concerns were echoed by Justine Wilkinson , who said despite being told there were 15 supervisors , she did not see one , and did not see any first aid officers either . <p> Mr Gold said there were medics at the event until the last four participants were in the final stages of the course , and he and his crew of four were also trained in first aid . <p> Mr Gold also said the obstacles were " built to handle people " . <p> He said about 400 people competed in the event on Sunday . <p> Not all of the feedback was negative . <p> Miss Garner said she did have a good time with her friends , and another participant reported it as having a great atmosphere . 
 <p> A father of two has been remembered as a legend of Australian water-ski racing after he died competing in the Southern 80 on the Murray River - the latest fatality at the high-speed event . <p> The annual river race in Echuca-Moama was suspended on Sunday after three serious incidents resulted in multiple injuries among the competitors . <p> The most serious incident killed 50-year-old David Morabito , from the Sydney suburb of Grose Vale , New South Wales . <p> Ski Racing Australia , the regulatory body for ski racing in Australia , confirmed the death in a statement on Sunday afternoon . <p> Mr Morabito was a highly-respected driver who had been involved with ski racing for many years . <p> He is survived by his wife , Katrina , son Sean and daughter Alicia . <p> " I 'm crying right now , " wrote Sean Morabito on Twitter , saying he was Mr Morabito 's son . <p> " The police showed up at our house and told us the bad news . " <p> Friends , fellow competitors and racing fans called him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sport " and have flooded the Southern 80 social media pages with messages of support . <p> Paul Raicevich , who had competed against Mr Morabito , said he had lost a true mate . <p> " The weekly phone calls , the years of friendly banter , will be truly missed , " he wrote on Facebook . <p> A team member , Chris Templeton , described himself as " gutted " . " I never felt unsafe knowing you were in the boat , " he wrote . " Racing will never be the same in my eyes without you mate . " <p> Ski Racing Australia said the incident occurred about 1.20pm during the main race of Sunday 's Southern 80 . <p> " It is understood that Mr Morabito , the driver of 2 Ironic , was pulled from the water unconscious near Norris Bend , " the statement said . <p> It 's believed his boat flipped in an air pocket , though police described it as a crash and are continuing to investigate . <p> Paramedics attempted to resuscitate Mr Morabito but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first paramedics to arrive at the crash site , Anita Stirling , praised those who tried to help , saying they could n't have done anything more to save him . <p> " What you did for your mate , getting him out of the water and doing really good and effective CPR , gave him every fighting chance while waiting for us to arrive , " she wrote on Facebook . <p> " You did a brilliant job . You did everything that you could and you deserve to be commended . " <p> Ski Racing Australia chairman Paul Robertson offered condolences to Mr Morabito 's family and said the incident had saddened the sport . <p> Several other incidents marred the popular event this year . One skier hit a buoy , while another hit the water hard , Ambulance Victoria spokesman John Mullen said . <p> A man in his 20s was flown to the Royal Melbourne Hospital in a serious but stable condition with head and spinal injuries , he said . <p> A woman , believed to be in her 20s , was flown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Two others were taken to hospital in Echuca : a man in his 40s with shoulder injuries and a man in his 20s in a serious but stable condition with head and neck injuries . <p> The rest of the day 's races were called off . <p> " Ski Racing Australia and Moama Water Sports Club will offer their deepest condolences and sympathies to the deceased man 's family and friends , and will provide all possible support to those involved , " the sporting body said in a statement published on the race 's Facebook page . <p> " Ski Racing Australia is not able to make any further comment at this time . " <p> The Southern 80 race sees teams with two skiers pulled through more than 100 bends in the river . Some racers can reach speeds of more than 200km/h . <p> The annual event attracts competitors from around the world and remains a major tourist draw for the region , but has suffered from multiple deaths in recent years . <p> In 2010 , seven people were injured and veteran skier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racer . <p> The fatalities came after the deaths of local man Craig O'Toole , of Rochester , in a high-speed boat crash in the 2007 race , and Sydney skier David Perrotto on a hairpin turn in 2006 . <p> The fifth death in 11 years has triggered a fierce debate online about the future of the sport , with spectators split between those who believe it 's too risky and others who say competitors are well-aware of the risks . <p> John Lomas , president of the Moama Water Sports Club , which runs the annual event , declined to say anything when contacted on Sunday . <p> " No comment . No comment , " he said . <p> But Campaspe Mayor Adrian Weston said he was confident racing organisers did everything they could to ensure this year 's race was as safe as possible . <p> " Ultimately , it 's in their hands around what the future may hold for the race , " he said . 
 <h> Trespassers narrowly escape path of train <p> Mr Sharp told 3AW 's Neil Mitchell the train had rounded the corner at 160 km/hr and was still traveling at 147 km/hr when he passed the biker . <p> " I reckon as he was going off the side of the bridge he would have almost scraped his boots on the side of my train as I went past him , it was that close . I really honestly thought that I had him and thank god that I did n't . <p> " As I came round the corner I was doing right on 160 km/hr and as soon as I saw him , the emergency brake I had to apply and still went past him doing 147 km/hr at that stage , " he said . <p> " He was pushing the bike across the bridge which was a pretty silly thing to do and as soon as he 'd seen me he fumbled the bike thinking he could try and get the bike off and then finally got some sense and decided to get himself off and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play for the interview with the train driver Colin Sharp <p> The collision is one of nearly 300 near hits on the V/Line network in the past year that have forced drivers to take evasive action such as sounding the whistle or applying emergency brakes when sighting people on or near the tracks . <p> V/Line CEO James Pinder said trains were quieter than most people expected even traveling at speeds of 160 km/hr . <p> " Our trains travel at up to 160 kilometres per hour , and many new services have been added to our timetable in the past two years -- with more to come . " <p> " Trains approaching at high speed are quieter than expected and it can take nearly a kilometre for a train to stop once the driver applies the brakes . " <p> The possible effects can be traumatic for staff , customers and members of the community , and cause disruption to services on the rail network . <p> " When people are reported on the tracks , V/Line often stops trains running in both directions , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pinder said . <p> " I 'd encourage people to only cross railway lines at marked crossings , respect all warning signs and always look both ways as trains can come from either direction .

 <h> Mafia kingpin Rocco Arico guilty of extortion , faces deportation <p> One of the state 's most powerful organised crime figures is facing a lengthy jail stint and deportation back to Italy after being convicted of extortion , drug and weapons offences . <p> Rocco Arico , 38 , has been identified by law enforcement as a major player in Melbourne 's underworld as a drug trafficker with family links to the ' Ndrangheta or Honoured Society one of the country 's most influential mafia groups . <p> The verdict is a major win for Victoria Police 's Purana anti-gangland taskforce , which had been investigating Arico for more than a year . <p> Arico has previous convictions for kidnapping in 1999 and attempted murder in 2000 , spending more than seven years in prison .

He ended up working off most of the debt by acting as an interstate drug mule . <p> But when Mitchell was shot six times outside a Brunswick gym in November 2011 , the friend falsely took credit for the attempted hit . <p> " I 'm a f---ing idiot . I said it ' cause , um , to get Arico off my back , " the friend testified . <p> Arico , incensed when he found out it was a lie , demanded he friend pay $50,000 that had been wiped off the original debt because they were friends .

Arico also punched the friend 's in the face and threatened to shoot up his home . <p> Under mounting pressure , the friend decided to break the underworld code of silence and co-operate with police investigators , eventually wearing a " wire " to a meeting with Arico where he was caught on tape offering to sell the friend a kilogram of ice . <p> Arico 's defence barrister Bruce Walmsley had branded the story a total fabrication , arguing that the friend was unreliable because he was a drug trafficker attempting to hide behind police from substantial debts to numerous criminals . <p> Arico also took the unusual step of testifying on his own behalf at his trial last year , claiming he was a property developer who had lent the friend money from gambling winnings but was unaware the friend was a drug dealer . <p> During cross-examination , prosecutor Kevin Armstrong branded Arico a " puppeteer " who controlled and manipulated those around him . <p> Arico 's brother-in-law also attempted to claim the gun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was rejected by the second jury who voted to convict on the charges .

 <p> Embattled former deputy speaker Don Nardella has been kicked out of the Labor Party caucus after he refused to pay back more than $100,000 he 'd claimed to maintain a beachside residence . <p> Speaking to media on Tuesday morning , Premier Daniel Andrews said he had put it in " very clear terms " to Mr Nardella that he should resign from the parliamentary Labor Party if he was unwilling to repay the money . <p> " I indicated to him as I have done for some time now that in my judgment he should repay the money that he claimed , " Mr Andrews said . <p> " He indicated to me that he was unwilling to do that and I accordingly asked him to resign from the parliamentary Labor Party and he has done that . <p> Mr Andrews said how Mr Nardella voted from now on was a matter for him . <p> " As to who he votes for , his support or otherwise , it 's entirely a matter for him - only he can speak to that .

 <h> Bendigo Advertiser letters to the editor <p> 11 Mar 2017 , 2 a.m . <p> Read today 's letters to the editor . <h> Wonderful people <p> You have to feel sad for One Nation leader Pauline Hanson and her belief that it would be difficult to spot a good Muslim . She does n't know what she is missing . Pauline , there are millions of good Muslims and they are easy to spot ... they look just like you and me . My wife and I , with support from about 20 very generous people from Bendigo and district , run a small project in Indonesia , helping to educate young Muslim women from a very poor village . One is now a teacher , another a nurse , giving back to their communities . They are the first girls from their village to go to university . Another nurse and a teacher will graduate in the next two years . I can tell you , Pauline , that these young women , and their families , are wonderful , generous people who think Australians are pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian , agnostic , atheist and their position , like ours , is that Muslims are good people . <p> So , Pauline , go to a Muslim country , sit down with ordinary people , be surrounded by their generosity and friendliness , and you will be a happier , kinder person for the experience . Sadly , I think you never will . <h> Peter Smith , Bendigo <p> INCONSISTENT : A reader says there are inconsistencies in relation to QEO signage . <h> QEO signage confusion <p> When Bendigo 's iconic Queen Elizabeth Oval was given a much needed upgrade some years ago one of the more controversial improvements was the removal of advertising hoardings around the perimeter fence . This was done for aesthetic reasons and most would agree this certainly improves the visual appearance of the venue . The lost earnings from sponsors for local users was possibly not a high priority for the decision-makers . It surprised me when I drove past the QEO yesterday to see the fence now adorned with sponsors signage . I would ascertain that these are there to appease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QEO this weekend . The inconsistencies in this decision making and the obvious bending of rules to suit a " big time player " do nothing for the reputation of those who make the rules . <h> Charles Jarrett , Maldon <h> Universal right to live free of disease <p> As a single woman who dates I am acutely aware of the prevalence of STDs . My recent experience of meeting a man who had genital herpes enhanced my fear of catching a STD . Motivated by fear of getting sick I went to the doctor and had a free STD test . While waiting for my results I realised how lucky I was to be in Australia , a country with a good quality public health system which is free for Australians to access . <p> I realised that people in developing countries would have a different experience engaging with STDs and health . 340 million cases of STDs occur around the world each year , with the greatest number in developing countries where STDs are the most common diseases treated by healthcare professionals other than malaria and diarrheal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of 100 people will be infected with a STD each year compared to only 9 out of 100 people in Australia . Even though the majority of STDs are preventable through public health measures like vaccines , antibiotics or condom usage , the sad reality is that developing countries lack the resources to fund this , resulting in larger numbers of people experiencing poor health and early death . When the doctor informed me that my STD test results detected no infection , I felt incredibly relieved and I realised having access to public health measures should n't be contingent on where you live . Viewed in this light , the Turnbull government should re-evaluate whether cutting 220 million dollars from the AusAid budget was immoral . Australia should recheck our priorities , because all people have the right to live free from disease . Our AusAid program is not a ' cost ' , but rather an ' investment ' into people 's health . When will the Turnbull government re-invest ? 
 <h> Cobalt 's surge attracts string of market hopefuls <p> Brian Mar 2017 , 8:21 p.m . <p> Like moths drawn irresistibly to light , the surge in the price of cobalt has got some market hopefuls looking to a new lease on life <p> Like moths drawn irresistibly to light , the surge in the price of cobalt over the past few months has sponsored a couple of quick sharemarket floats and a rush of explorers hoping to latch onto the latest signs of life among some of the more exotic metals . <p> Just as lithium has won a lot of speculative investor support on the back of the prospects of rising demand with increased battery usage thanks to electric cars , even though any demand from this source is a decade away , at the very least , now it is cobalt 's turn . <p> Also giving cobalt a lift was the criticism of Apple Computer for sourcing its supplies of the material from uncontrolled mines in Congo , along with security issues in parts of that country that have raised additional questions over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tighten control over its purchases of cobalt to avoid both child labour and harsh working conditions , although it has also said it wants to avoid causing too much disruption to the miners who need the income from supplying the high-tech giant . <p> In the process , the price of cobalt has surged around 40 per cent over the past few months to more than $50,000 a tonne , with the speed of the rally catching may in the market by surprise . <p> So , for a material that has been mostly an unwanted byproduct of nickel or copper mines , with usually very little value , the surge in its price has raised the prospect that standalone cobalt mines could be developed if the price rise proves to be sustained . <p> Geoff Hill , long-time investment banker and corporate adviser , initially to John Spalvins who spun a tug boat operator in Adelaide to a sprawling conglomerate owning breweries and department stores last century , was quick out of the blocks , launching a $10 million raising for Cobalt Blue .

It was spun out of Heron Resources , and it is already touting a pre-feasibility study on some cobalt-nickel acreage near Kalgoorlie , which it is calling the " largest resource in the developed world " . <p> A host of others have figured out that pegging cobalt acreage might just give their share price sufficient lift to justify a quick fund-raising so they can eke out another few months of life . Last Tuesday , it was Latin American Resources disclosing acreage in Argentina and later in the week Cohiba ? ? ?

 <p> Bendigo could n't have asked for much more in terms of the pre-season match it was fixtured by the AFL . <p> Not only was it a week four match the last before the season starts -- and treated by both the Bombers and Cats as a full dress rehearsal for round one , but we got two of the big Victorian clubs in our backyard . <p> There has been plenty of focus on the Bombers and intrigue during the pre-season given the return of the 10 players who were banned last year following the supplements saga . <p> The Bombers also showcased No.1 draft pick , Andrew McGrath , while on the opposition side was Geelong 's reigning Brownlow medallist , Patrick Dangerfield , plus the player who will go down as one of Bendigo 's greatest talents , Cats ' skipper Joel Selwood ( pictured ) , who was back on the for the first time in more than a decade . <p> The Cats won the game by 22 points <p> However , it was n't just the madison carnival and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector . <p> The Bendigo Triathlon Festival part of the new Ultimate Triathlon Series was also in town at the weekend , the Victorian Urban Fire Brigade Championships at Weeroona Oval attracting more than 60 teams and the Victorian Pony Club Team the Bendigo Showgrounds added to a stacked calendar . <p> All events that were wonderful opportunities for Bendigo to sell itself to thousands of visitors to the city . <p> But it was also a major weekend at grassroots level at the business end of the seasons for local cricket , lawn bowls and tennis .

 <h> When crooks get sentences like these , police wonder why they bother <p> Bagging courts over so-called weak sentences is easy because law and order is popular and there are no votes in rehabilitation . <p> In the media , cases can be reduced to a few sentences or a 30-second voiceover that fail to communicate the complexities of the matters heard at trial . <p> Many judges feel they are unfairly maligned because the true reasons for their sentencing get lost along the way . <p> And then a case comes along that leaves you baffled such as the prosecution of Mr Rodney Phillips , 25 , and Mr Sam , 23 . <p> Sentenced this week for a series of offences that only by luck does not include murdering a police officer , they have been given a dream deal because the system has chosen pragmatism over justice . <p> These are not young blokes who made dumb decisions and deserve a second chance . They have priors for violence , including armed robbery and are members of the vicious jail gang , The Prisoners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a clear and present danger to all of us . And yet they were able to plead to reduced charges just to avoid a jury trial . <p> First the facts . They had been out of jail for two and four days respectively , had sourced themselves a shotgun , stolen a car . Then they went out to firebomb the houses of dead drug boss Carl Williams ' father , George and ex-wife Roberta . <p> But the knuckleheads had the wrong addresses and two days later , returned to finish the job . <p> A police car driven by Constable Ben Ashmole followed the suspect vehicle into a dead end and the crooks did a U-turn and blasted the police with a shotgun . <p> It was only because Ashmore saw the gun that he was able to duck and not take the full blast in the head . <p> Even so , 14 pellets struck his skull and 11 have n't been able to be removed . <p> Quite rightly the pair were charged with attempted murder , arson , firearms offences and several other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid a trial . The attempted murder charge was watered down to recklessly causing injury and similar offences . <p> What ? <p> The dictionary says reckless is doing something thoughtless and unthinking . Pointing a shotgun at the cabin of a police car and pulling the trigger is a deliberate act . <p> Phillips was given a minimum of six years , two months while received a minimum of six years . <p> Regardless of how this is spun , it is proof that something is seriously wrong with our justice system and police around the state are right now wondering why they bother . <p> These two should have got at least six years for the car theft , the arson and the firearms charges . They were not cleanskins . They had been out of jail for less than a week for heaven 's sake . <p> Last year the government introduced legislation banning parole for police killers - which in many cases will mean a life sentence . <p> And yet these two who could have killed were given a dream deal . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fleeing at high speed because they know if they are caught the punishment is minor . <p> Once , crooks knew that to shoot at police was an act that would bring about dire consequences . <p> What should have happened in this case is that all deals should have been rejected and if the crooks wanted to go to trial , so be it . <p> And then they should have been sentenced to a minimum of 20 years . <p> Instead they shook hands and smiled when they were sentenced . <p> Constable Ben Ashmole will have to deal with the consequences of being shot for life . His two attackers will be out of jail in a few years . 
 <p> MANY years of work have culminated in Bendigo and District Aboriginal Co-operative officially opening its new health and community centre this week . <p> The $5.7 million first stage of the organisation 's new centre on Prouses Road , North Bendigo includes three eye-catching buildings that house administration offices , the medical centre , and family and community services . <p> The new site also features car parks and landscaping , while an existing building has been transformed into an Indigenous men 's shed . <p> " Our new community and wellbeing centre has been a focus of our strategic direction for many years and resulted from the hard work and foresight of both past and present members of the BDAC board , staff , strategic partners , but most importantly , from listening to the needs of our community members , " chief executive officer Raylene Harradine said . <p> Ms Harradine said the design of the precinct had been inspired by the artwork of two local artists , Georgina Riseley and Trina . <p> Health general manager Dallas Widdicombe said this work depicted meeting places and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the buildings on site and the paths that led between them . <p> Mr Widdicombe said the new medical centre had seven consulting rooms - two more than the old space - as well as dedicated spaces for allied health professionals . <p> Ms Harradine said the plan had been to create a " space that would suit the needs of our community , in a setting that provides access to the bush " . <p> The new premises brought the organisation 's services together at one location , she said , although some would continue to be delivered from its Forest Street site . <p> Ms Harradine said the new centre would also help support the growth of the organisation and its services into the future . <p> The land for the new site was purchased in October 2009 and funding from the federal government was secured in 2012 . <p> Construction work began in late 2015 and Ms Harradine said the project was completed on budget . <p> The new premises were designed by Select Architects and built by local company Nicholson Constructions . <p> BDAC is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This will include a childcare centre , community culture centre , caf ? and community garden , conference centre , and training and education facilities . <p> The Aboriginal health organisation was formed 16 years ago in the wake of the loss of Bendigo 's Aboriginal primary health service . 
 <h> PM claim that state has locked up ' enormous ' stores of conventional gas rebuffed <p> Josh Gordon , State Political Mar 2017 , 6:17 p.m . <p> Malcolm Turnbull 's claim that Victoria is contributing to an energy crisis by locking up " an enormous " amount of conventional onshore gas has been strongly rebuffed by the state government . <p> Malcolm Turnbull 's claim that Victoria is contributing to an energy crisis by locking up " an enormous " amount of conventional onshore gas has been strongly rebuffed by the state government . <p> On Wednesday the prime minister accused Victoria of being the worst offender when it came to blocking conventional gas production , saying the state was adding to a national gas crisis . <p> The Andrews government last year banned the process known as fracking , whereby liquid is injected into the ground at high pressure to release gas trapped in rock , and also extended a moratorium introduced by the former Coalition government on onshore conventional gas development until June 2020 . <p> " In Victoria ... there is a huge amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very large offshore gas resource in Bass Strait . There is also an enormous amount of gas onshore that can be accessed by conventional means , without fracking , " Mr Turnbull said . <p> " The Victorian Labor government , as usual , guided by its alliance with the Greens , has banned conventional gas exploration and , of course , also unconventional gas exploration and development . " <p> But the assertion that the state government is blocking an enormous amount of conventional onshore gas production in Victoria has been met with puzzlement from energy market experts and the state government . <p> A 2015 parliamentary inquiry found the state does have large reserves of conventional gas ( although in recent years that too has been depleted ) , but it is located in Bass Strait , where extraction is relatively non-controversial . <p> But the state 's reserves of onshore conventional gas is far less clear . As the 2015 parliamentary inquiry notes , there has been a lot of exploration for onshore conventional gas reserves in Victoria since the 1950s . <p> No conventional gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional gas was discovered near the Port Campbell township , in the onshore Otway Basin , where it was extracted until being depleted in about 2006 . <p> The bottom line is that there are currently no proved or probable onshore gas reserves in Victoria even though numerous exploration licences have been issued . <p> The Geological Survey of Victoria does , however , estimates that up to 110 petajoules of conventional gas could be accessible , subject to a comprehensive geoscientific investigation . To put that in context , 110 petajoules represents about six months ' supply , which is far from an " enormous " amount . <p> " Malcolm Turnbull might want to pretend that this has got something to do with an unknown and undeclared gas resource in the state of Victoria , " he said . " I think it has a lot more to do with an enormous resource that is being shipped offshore . <p> " Quite frankly , the fact that Malcolm Turnbull continues to try to muddy the waters around what is the underlying cause to the increase in gas prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of Victoria . " <p> Victoria 's moratorium on conventional onshore gas exploration is due to end in June 2020. 
 <p> FRIDAY night 's game between the Sydney Uni Flames and Dandenong Rangers that ultimately decided this season 's championship reiterated just what a shame it is that there 's no television coverage of the Women 's National Basketball League . <p> The Flames defeated the Rangers 75-62 to win the best-of-three grand final series 2-0 . <p> But with no television coverage of the competition for the second season in a row , to watch the grand final battle you had to do so through a live stream off the WNBL website or through Facebook . <p> This at a time when women 's sport is all the rage throughout Australia . <p> The inaugural AFL women 's competition , Women 's Big Bash League that included two games between the Melbourne Renegades and Hobart Hurricanes at the QEO in December and new Super Netball league have all proven big sporting hits with plenty of television exposure . <p> So why is n't Australia 's premier women 's basketball competition able to attract the same interest from television networks ? <p> The WNBL had previously been the domain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the competition for 35 years before the coverage was axed at the end of the 2014-15 season following Federal Government budget cuts . <p> The WNBL is a star-studded , high quality product among the top echelon of women 's basketball competitions in the world , as those who follow the Bendigo Spirit would attest . <p> And that 's what makes the cutting of the TV coverage over the past two years a sore point here in Bendigo because it 's costing our national team the exposure that had previously come with the ABC partnership . <p> The cutting of the TV coverage has to have made WNBL clubs like the Spirit a less-attractive proposition for potential sponsors because they can no longer provide that exposure on national TV . <p> With no TV coverage , interest in the competition is going to wane out of sight , out of mind and puts more pressure on the clubs to find promotional ways to maintain a presence of significance in the crowded landscape of elite sport in Australia . 
 <h> THE BASICS <h> FIRST MONTH <h> PAST 5 YEARS <h> SUMMARY <p> After a winless season in 2016 , the only way is up for Bears . <p> Second-year coach Greg Gadsden has retained his young core group of players and has added some class and depth to the group . <p> Key position player Justin Laird is the most exciting inclusion for the Bears . Laird , who looks set to play centre half-forward , was in the inter-league squad last year and will give the young Bears a much-needed focal point in attack . <p> Improvement will come from within , particularly from the young players who have one year of senior footy under their belt . <p> " We 'll have more depth than last year , ' ' Gadsden said . " We 've kept our core group and added a few handy players to the mix . <p> " With such a young group we 'll still get inconsistency , but our aim is to keep these young guys together and build them into a good football side . We 're confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are out of the question , but three or four wins would be a big step forward for the Bears . <h> Q&amp;A with Greg Gadsden <p> Q : With such a young group , what do you work on first - improvement in attack or tightening up the defence ? <p> We need to score more . We did n't have a potent enough forward line last year to score enough goals . I though defensively last year , outside of the games against the top couple of teams , we were n't too bad . <p> Scoring was our issue and I think we 've added a couple of players this year that will help us in that area . <p> We 've also picked up some players that will help us off half-back and through the midfield , so that should give our forwards more opportunities . <h> DEPARTURES <h> COACHING PANEL <h> LAST THREE YEARS <p> 2016 : Eighth <p> 2015 : Seventh <p> 2014 : Eighth <p> Meika Gladman <h> SUMMARY <p> IT 'S been a lean few seasons for Bears , who finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over Inglewood . <p> But the arrival of new coach Cara Bastian , coupled with the return of dual A-grade league best and fairest Sarah Perry and the retention of the bulk of their senior playing squad , gives the Bears plenty of reason of optimism . <p> Bastian , a member of Strathfieldsaye 's 2015 grand final team , brings with her plenty of premiership playing experience from her previous stint in the Loddon Valley with YCW . <p> The former league representative said players had relished a fresh approach to pre-season . <p> " We 've engaged a personal trainer this year and worked a lot on our fitness early , but the girls have really taken to the court work and enjoying the new approach , " she said . <p> The Bears played United in a practice match last Saturday and will front up against Newstead this weekend . <p> " We 're really looking to make sure we have the right combinations on the court as we heads towards Bridgewater in the first round , " Bastian said . The Bears first home game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cara Bastian <p> Q : What has brought you back to the LVFNL ? <p> I 'm originally from the Loddon Valley ( YCW ) , so I decided I would switch back across and look at a coaching opportunity and this one presented itself . I think I have a bit to offer the girls here and I hope I can transfer a fair bit of knowledge to them over the course of the year . <p> Q : Last year was a tough one for the Bears , where do you believe you can turn things around ? <p> I want to take things right back to basics . Work on the fundamentals and get them ingrained in all aspects of the club and across all grades , so we can continue to build on those for the years to come . There 's an influx of new girls , but I 'm hopeful all the girls can step up . 
 <h> Blame game over gas supply woes <p> Brian Mar 2017 , 10:53 p.m . <p> The dominant gas transporter , APA warned that frequent rule changes are creating policy uncertainty , threatening to cause " sovereign risk " for investors , but some are n't convinced the company itself is n't the problem . <p> The nation 's dominant gas transporter , APA , has warned that frequent rule changes are creating policy uncertainty and threatening to cause " sovereign risk " for investors in the gas and pipeline industries as large players in the industry point the finger at the company for acting to further its own interests . <p> Following a series of acquisitions , APA has emerged as one of the largest companies in Australia and dominates the movement of gas across the eastern states , with a network extending from Victoria and South Australia into northern Queensland . <p> Gas consumers have been critical of the lack of transparency in the industry which has triggered studies and enquiries by the consumer watchdog the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission along with other bodies such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gas summit between Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and gas industry leaders , a commitment was given to expediting a series of changes in the way the gas industry operates which are hoped to boost gas supplies as prices surge which are threatening the survival of whole industries . <p> In its submission to the Finkel Review into the electricity industry , APA argued limiting regulated pipeline owners from appealing regulator errors is a risk it is facing at present , along with access to pipelines being set " in an adverse manner to pipelines ongoing viability " . Other risks include the lack of clarity around the future operations of Victoria 's transmission market , it argued . <p> " We fear the Finkel Review panel has been supplied incorrect information for it to identify pipeline capacity currently as an area of concern , " it warned in its submission . <h> accusation <p> But one large gas provider , Lochard Energy , the arm of QIC which paid $1.8 billion for the Iona gas storage facility in Victoria , said underspending by APA has hampered efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion be driven by market requirements and not proposals of regulated pipeline owners who may not be acting in the best interests of the market as a whole , " Lochard Energy noted in its submission . <p> " This requires a review and overhaul of the current access regime to facilitate efficient pipeline investment . For example , network constraints limit the ability of gas facilities like Lochard Energy to provide services . <p> " Victorian gas transmission owner APA systematically underspent the refurbishment and upgrade allowed by the ... regulator for 2013-2017 ... by a significant margin of 25 per cent . " <p> Despite APA 's concerns , large gas exporter APLNG threw its weight behind the moves to lift transparency in the domestic gas market which are the subject of a host of policy reforms being pursued by COAG 's gas market reform group , AEMC , the ACCC and others . <p> Increased sharing of information , further development of gas market hubs and eliminating barriers to increase access to transportation capacity would all assist the company " with the required flexibility to sell additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted in its submission to the review . <p> Much of the criticism of the surge in the domestic gas price is based on the size of the spike from the long-term price which ran at $3-$4 a gigajoule to more than $20 a gigajoule in some recent supply contracts . <p> As APLNG noted , the cost of development and production has risen " significantly " it noted , arguing that the " historical basis for gas prices is ... no longer an accurate reflection of current costs " . <p> It pointed to recent Credit Suisse estimates that the wellhead costs for APLNG is around , rising to $7.25 for Gladstone LNG and to up to $9.50 for Queensland LNG. 
 <h> Mary Reilly , Wattle Park <h> Look beyond our shores for inspiration <p> With so much attention on shortages of power production capacity , why has n't tidal and wave power production been given a mention ? <p> South Australia has got a large coastline , as does the rest of Australia and it does not rely on the sun on cloudy days or no wind for wind turbines . <p> Let 's face it , if the tides stop , lack of electricity will be the least of our worries . <p> Why do n't the politicians check out Spain , Portugal and Scotland to see how it works ? <h> Daryl De Araugo , Eaglehawk <h> Labor government 's plan does not add up <p> The Andrews ' Labor government embarrassed itself again on Tuesday with its idiotic " battery to save us all " announcement , but not a single question about the real world impact of his idiotic battery scheme from local media . <p> " Electricity bill Dan " says he is going to give 20 to 25 million of our dollars to companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop 100MW of electricity storage . <p> But what does he mean ? <p> Electricity storage is measured in hours , or minutes , of electricity stored at a certain demand 100MW of " batteries " means nothing . <p> But given South Australia 's Twitter frenzy with a US , we can guess our $25 million or so is to part-pay for an hour of supply drawn at 100MW . <p> Sadly for Dan , Victoria 's demand at 2.06pm the day of the announcement was . <p> So Dan 's battery might supply 1.3 per cent of afternoon demand for an hour , or put another way , 45 seconds of total demand before the batteries are exhausted . <p> Just wow . <p> The price quoted for a 100MWh system by Telsa 's battery division head , Lyndon Rive , is $66 million for 400 white industrial boxes placed on an area about the size of a soccer pitch . <p> As a result of this installation price Dan 's battery power will cost $660,000 a Mwh , or $660 a kWh the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents per kWh . <p> But it gets worse . At the time of the announcement , intermittent sources like wind etc were supplying of the state 's demand that 's 1.4 per cent of the power being used in homes and businesses etc . <p> Despite that , Dan 's Labor tell us it intends to supply 40 per cent of the state 's demand using intermittent sources by 2025 -- just eight years away ! <p> To generate sufficient electricity to supply 40 per cent of to Victoria on a day like Tuesday , Victoria will need to install farms with an faceplate capacity that 's more than 83 times as many windmills as are currently installed , or about 28,104 bird choppers ! 
 <h> Editorial : ' Data drought ' crippling rural communities <p> Editorial : City-centric politicians must listen to the bush on telecommunication shortcomings . <p> It was touted as the technology to finally bring Australia into the 21st century , though perhaps not to the extent of some of our trading partners . <p> The National Broadband Network would provide internet access and speeds that would make it far easier for us all to learn , to be entertained and to develop new markets for existing and fledgling businesses . <p> We had already seen the amazing success of similar infrastructure investments overseas , with the experience of South Korea the absolute standout example . <p> Labor promised one big expensive system and was in the process of making that happen when they got booted out of power . <p> It was then the Coalition 's job to deliver the NBN , albeit a system that had far fewer bells and whistles . <p> This though , they explained , meant it was affordable and able to be delivered in a timely manner for all Australians , regardless of whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Over the past year this version of the NBN has slowly come to the Bendigo region . Along with that has been the spruikers encouraging households to sign-up for some amazing deals , with some equally amazing connection speeds . <p> If you restricted your reading to the advertisements and the PR spin , you would easily think the NBN has comfortably delivered everything anyone could ever want . <p> The reality , though , is quite different . <p> The Victorian Farmers Federation fears that the NBN , for all its promise , wo n't provide primary producers and rural families with either the reception or download speeds they need . <p> This week , the VFF will join will join with 16 other groups in a regional , rural and remote communications coalition in travelling to Canberra to lobby federal parliamentarians . <p> It is not unfair to say that the state 's regional centres generally have poor telecommunications technology , but it gets dramatically worse the further out one goes . <p> The VFF describes this situation as a " data drought " that is holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecast to be worth $63 billion in 2016-17 back from reaching its full potential . <p> We support the communications coalition 's call for rural people to get their voice heard on these issues in order to find solutions . 
 <p> Ms Abernethy has worked in fisheries for more than a decade . She will use the award to work with women in the fishing industry to determine what information and training will help them better engage with the community and take on greater leadership opportunities . <p> She said while women represented more than half of the fishing industry 's workforce , they made up less than five per cent of the executive positions in the industry , and with the award , she would like to address that . <p> She said the project would give women in the fishing industry the skills to promote the fresh and sustainable seafood that is available in Victoria and Australia . <p> Agriculture Minister Jaala Pulford announced Ms Abernethy as the winner of the prestigious award at a ceremony held at Parliament House . <p> Ms Abernethy was selected by an independent panel alongside three other finalists , Cath Jenkins , Joelene Williams and Lisa Brassington . She will receive a $10,000 bursary to help implement her project . <p> She will also attend the Australian Institute of Directors ' Course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ award winner , who will be announced later this year . <p> The RIRDC Rural Women 's Award acknowledges the leadership role women play in agriculture and rural communities . The award is supported by Agriculture Victoria and is sponsored nationally by Westpac . <p> Ms Pulford said the Andrews Labor Government was continuing to support women in agriculture by backing initiatives such as Museum Victoria 's Invisible Farmer Project , which gave women in agriculture the chance to tell their stories . <p> She also announced the re-establishment of the Rural Women 's Network in Victoria , from July 1 . <p> Ms Pulford congratulated Ms Abernethy and the other finalists , and said the projects they proposed showed innovation , leadership and knowledge that could influence their industries , the state and the country . <p> " Women are n't just helping shape Victoria 's agricultural agenda , they are leading it , " she said .

 <p> Animal rights group PETA is calling on shearers to report drug use following an investigation which exposed disturbing video footage of sheep being stomped on , brutally cut and bashed with hammers . <p> Animal rights group PETA is calling on shearers to report drug use following an investigation which exposed disturbing video footage of sheep being stomped on , brutally cut and bashed with hammers . <p> The group has launched a billboard in Horsham which urged people to report drug and animal abuse in shearing sheds . <p> The ad features the gaunt face of a man beside the words : " Dave has been up on ice for three days . Shearing and drugs do n't mix . If you see something , say something . Always report animal abuse . " <p> The Victorian Farmers Federation is " flabbergasted " by the billboard , and accused PETA of targeting shearers to push its political agenda . <p> The wool industry came under heavy scrutiny in 2014 following the release of videos showing workers violently abusing sheep . <p> Evidence against the shearers included hidden camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also showed wool workers beating sheep in the face with electric clippers triggered a series of landmark court hearings in Horsham , in which four shearers will be sentenced on 60 counts of animal cruelty . <p> Following an investigation by Agriculture Victoria , the state 's Director of Public Prosecutions filed charges against a total of six men . <p> One has already been fined and banned from shearing for two years after pleading guilty to four counts of cruelty , while another will face court in May on six counts . <p> PETA associate director of campaigns Ashley Fruno said until drug use was eradicated , the lives of animals were at risk . <p> " Animals can be injured or even killed when workers shear them under the influence of drugs " , he said . <p> " Shearers in Horsham and across the country can help sheep by bringing to light the dangerous behaviour which appears to be widespread throughout Australian sheds . " <p> However , Victorian Farmers Federation vice president Brett Hosking said he was " flabbergasted " by the PETA billboard and accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shearers . <p> " First of all , what I will say is that it really is n't PETA 's role , we have police and the reporting authorities in place for these types of situations , " he said . <p> " Police have the expertise , they are trained , and they are by far the best people to be dealing with this type of issue . PETA have absolutely no qualifications in the area at all . " <p> Mr Hosking said there was no denying there were issues with crystal methamphetamine in rural communities but farmers had a zero tolerance policy on drug use . <p> " Drug use and mistreatment of animals is never tolerated by farmers in Victoria , " he said . <p> He added there were stringent regulations in place to reduce the risk of shearers working under the influence of drugs . <p> National Farmers Federation president Fiona Simson said the impacts in business include absenteeism , lost productivity , lower quality of work and risks to workplace safety and the effect of all these factors on team and group morale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't fix the problem - it 's a complex issue that requires a coordinated effort from everyone in the workplace - including employers , employees and contractors , " she said . <p> She added the shearing industry is currently working on how to deal with drug and alcohol use in sheds , with a particular focus on the drug ' ice ' . <p> Balmoral Liberal Party delegate and wool producer Robert Lawrence has said drug use was one of the " top three issues facing the wool industry " . <p> He said in one incident a shearer broke 14 legs of sheep during two days of shearing. 
 <h> What we 'll do to keep the lights on post Hazelwood : grid operator <p> Adam Mar 2017 , 8:30 a.m . <p> As the giant Hazelwood coal plant turns off the last of its units , the national electricity grid manager has sought to reassure the public it is taking steps to ensure the lights stay on when demand soars next summer . <p> As the giant Hazelwood coal plant turns off the last of its units , the national electricity grid manager has sought to reassure the public it is taking steps to ensure the lights stay on when demand soars next summer . <p> In an interview with Fairfax Media , the Australian Energy Market Operator AEMO said Hazelwood 's closure would be offset by the availability of three mothballed gas-fired stations - one each in South Australia , Tasmania and Queensland - and large industrial businesses agreeing to time-shift their electricity use in the event of an emergency . <p> " The risk is no greater than it was this summer when you look at the generation that 's available to us , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's owners have gradually shut off its eight generation units this week ahead of its closure on Friday . <p> Its exit last week prompted ex-prime minister Tony Abbott to issue an 11th-hour call for taxpayers to subsidise the plant 's operation to ensure supply was maintained . <p> The plea drew ridicule , with critics pointing out the ageing plant faced outstanding WorkSafe notices that would cost hundreds of millions to fix . But Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce also claimed Hazelwood 's closure would lead to blackouts and the Australian Industry Group said propping up Hazelwood was one of several steps that should be considered to ensure the lights stayed on . <p> Mr Cleary said removing Hazelwood 's 1600 megawatt capacity could have left a shortfall of between 200 and 500 megawatts in the event of a worst-case scenario - extreme temperatures , mass use of airconditioners and no wind to drive turbines . <p> But he said if necessary this would be replaced by about 830 megawatts of gas-fired power that has not been in use . <p> French company Engie on Wednesday announced it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pelican Point in South Australia to bid into the electricity market at full capacity , and the owners of Tasmania 's Tamar Valley station and Queensland 's Swanbank E have signalled their plants will be available if required . <p> Mr Cleary said there was also the potential to reduce peak demand from some big industry players , removing the need for up to 300 megawatts capacity , under an arrangement that would shift production to off-peak times . <p> He said nobody could guarantee there would not be blackouts - faults , bushfires and extreme storms remain a risk , as always - but " assuming everything works according to plan we should be OK " . <p> Its assessment of the scenario faced next summer does not yet factor in the possible introduction of large-scale battery storage systems in South Australia and Victoria . Governments in both states are running tenders in the hope of having batteries available as back-up for next summer 's peak . <p> The South Australian government has also ordered 200 megawatts of back-up , most likely from portable diesel generators , after experiencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While AEMO has warned of potential east coast gas shortages as the majority of supply is exported to Asia , Mr Cleary downplayed the risk , saying authorities and companies had begun to address the issue . <p> " We 're seeing the Prime Minister taking action to be able to get gas back into the domestic market , we 're seeing the SA government respond , " he said . <p> Hazelwood 's owners , Engie and Japanese company Mitsui , announced the plant 's closure last November , saying it was no longer commercially viable . <p> Meanwhile , a Greens-led Senate inquiry called on the government to introduce a national plan for the orderly shutdown of the country 's remaining 23 coal plants and their replacement by renewable power . <p> Greens climate and energy spokesman Adam Bandt said the committee had heard evidence that the equivalent of a plant would need to shut each year for Australia to meet its commitments under the Paris climate agreement . <p> A dissenting report by Coalition Senators said the Greens had made " ideologically driven conclusions " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> They said an effective transition in the electricity system was not best achieved by forcing coal plants to shut . 
 <p> What that says about how we 've changed as a society is open to interpretation . <p> A factory in an industrial estate is a strange setting for the state 's population centre - a sort of " centre of gravity " around which the state 's population is distributed . <p> Melbourne 's population centre has moved , too , but it 's only shifted 1 ? ? kilometres west within the City of Glen Iris from a block of units in Park Road to a hardware store on Weir Street . <p> Population centre of Melbourne : 15 Weir Street , Glen Iris . <p> This is the point that is closer to more people in Greater Melbourne than anywhere else . <p> It 's the place , as Melbourne University Professor Kevin O'Connor once told The Age , where , " if you run a business and you want to supply everyone in Melbourne , this is the best place to be " . <p> Back in Coburg , though , the state 's population centre , there is n't a single person in sight when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain . <p> The factory has no signage on its barbed wire and mesh fencing , so I ca n't tell what is manufactured here ( hopefully not meth because I lost the ability to sprint when I fractured my ankle two years ago ) . <p> I follow the perimeter fence to what might be an entrance of sorts , a door that says Sales and Enquiries . But it 's blocked off by a large pile of garbage bags . <p> Eventually I do find the front office . It 's on a different street about 100 metres away , at the rear of the hulking grey shed with its big aluminium vats that hum . <p> There is a sign too . It 's Ernest Hillier 's , " makers of delectable chocolate since 1914 " . <p> Hallelujah ! The population centre of Victoria is a chocolate factory . <p> Ernest Hillier also went into voluntary administration two years ago but that 's another story . They 're still in business but under different owners . <p> I ring a door bell that sounds like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve , the factory accountant , who is clearly a busy man with little time to indulge a journalist 's irrelevant questions . <p> What 's it like to be in Coburg North , the population centre of Victoria , I ask him . 
 <p> But it happened in the April 1 opening round of the Loddon Valley season on Saturday when Bears created the first headline of 2017 with its upset 21-point win over Bridgewater . <p> The Bears turned a three-point deficit at three quarter-time into a 14.9 ( 93 ) to 10.12 ( 72 ) victory in a stunning start to the season . <p> The win ended the Bears ' 18-game losing streak , with it their first since beating Pyramid Hill by four points in the 2015 qualifying final . <p> The result also ended Bridgewater 's 30-game winning streak , with it the Mean Machine 's first loss since a 13-point defeat to Pyramid Hill in round five , 2015 . <p> " We went there today giving ourselves a good chance of being competitive and it was a really good win by the boys , " Bears coach Greg Gadsden said . <p> " Our pressure around the contest was exceptional all day and the boys got their reward at the end of the day for the work they did . " <p> The Bears ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them were young kids aged 22 or under and they all did exceptionally well , " Gadsden said . <p> " For the club to not win a game of footy in any grade last year and to start the way we have today , with our thirds also having a win , it 's just fantastic , " Gadsden said . <p> " A lot of hard work has gone in over the pre-season and we had a very even contribution today . " <p> James Rippingale was a strong focal point for the Bears who had lost their previous 11 games against Bridgewater booting six goals , including five in the second half , to be named best . <p> One of the new players in the side , Brodie Hawke , was among the best for his role through the midfield and across half-back . <p> Harry Gadsden in the midfield and Orion , who played at full-back on Alex Collins ( three goals ) , were also in the Bears ' better players . <p> The loss was Bridgewater 's first on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round five , 2013 when beaten by the Bears by three points . <p> The Mean Machine had won their previous 29 games at home , while for the first time since round three of the 2014 season , they are n't on top of the ladder . <p> " We were just outworked today . We had five players on debut , so there has been a bit of personnel change , but there 's no excuse , " Bridgewater coach Marc Lindsay said . <p> " Around the ball we were beaten on the spread and it was a work-rate issue for us . You ca n't buy hunger and we were lacking that today , which is something that has n't been said about Bridgewater for a while . <p> The Demons who lost all four matches against the last year , including the preliminary final kicked five goals to two in the final term to prevail 10.12 ( 72 ) to 8.13 ( 61 ) . <p> " It was good to start with a win against a side that has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years , " Demons coach Anthony Dennis said . <p> " It was a bit of a scrappy game ... the pressure from both teams was very good , which created a lot of turnovers , but being the first game of the year , it will probably take a couple of weeks to get back into the rhythm . " <p> The Demons ' best was a new recruit in Sam Brinsmead , who provided damaging drive off half-back . <p> Luke Marchesi , who won plenty of clearances , Sam Green on the wing and Alex Davis , who held Mitiamo coach Justin Maddern to one goal , were also in the best for the Demons , who after kicking 3.9 in the first half booted a more accurate 7.3 in the second . <p> Dennis got through the game well in what was his return from a knee injury in round two , last year . <p> Kyle Patten kicked five of Mitiamo 's eight goals to be the ' best player . <p> " We turned the ball over through the middle to much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we probably should have played a couple more because we were a bit flat today , " Maddern said . <p> * Maiden Gully YCW Eagles ' new era got away to a winning start with a nine-point victory over Inglewood . <p> The Eagles withstood a last-quarter surge from the Blues to win 11.15 ( 81 ) to 10.12 ( 72 ) at Empire State Hotel Oval . <p> " We made it a bit hard for ourselves , but got it done in the end , which was good , " Maiden Gully YCW Eagles coach Daniel Francis said . <p> " It was a massive day for the club and it was a really good contest all game . <p> " Inglewood really came to play and came home strong in the end , but we were able to hang on and it was a good character-building win . " <p> The Eagles who are 1-0 for the first time since 2009 had led by 31 points at three quarter-time , but the Blues surged with the wind in the final term , closing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eagles ' sealer was kicked by Travis Mercadante . <p> The best for the Eagles was onballer Dylan Pierce , who did plenty of in-and-under work . 
 <h> FIRST MONTH <h> LAST FIVE YEARS <p> THE trajectory is on the right path for Castlemaine as it enters 2017 under new coach Derrick Filo . <p> Over the previous three seasons under former coach Shane Robertson the Magpies have built from three wins in 2014 , to six in 2015 and seven last year their most since 2007 . <p> The challenge now for Filo and the Magpies is to continue that trend in pursuit of the club 's first senior finals appearance since 2005 . <p> The Magpies have added some top-end talent to their list in the return of pacy midfielder Wayne Schultz , who won the Michelsen Medal in a Castlemaine side that won just two games in 2011 . <p> The classy Simon Seddon who famously kicked 10 goals in the second half of Labrador 's QAFL grand final loss to Morningside in 2014 is also a key addition to the Magpies ' midfield brigade , who will also be dangerous inside forward 50 . <p> As well as Schultz , another former Magpie in forward Joel Smith is back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of last year 's leading goalkicker Rhys Ford to North Bendigo . <p> Veteran Luke Walters is back at the club and Joel Osbrough will give the Magpies some versatility , including playing in the ruck . <p> The long-list of new arrivals stretches to 17-and-under squad , with 10 new faces joining a pair of last year 's players Maddy Blake and Brianna Pedretti . <p> Perhaps the Magpies biggest inclusion is new coach Debbie Symes , who brings with her 25-years of coaching and playing experience from stints at rival BFNL clubs Eaglehawk , South Bendigo and Golden Square . <p> Club secretary Lorelle Huntly said players had responded positively to the new coach , in particular her training methods . <p> It is hoped some success will flow . <p> " For the first time in a long time it 's looking really good . Just getting the teams up has been a win for us , " she said . <p> With the bulk of their senior list travelling from Bendigo , the Magpies will train in Bendigo each second week . <h> Q &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact has Debbie Symes had at Castlemaine in her first few months ? <p> She 's been really good , she 's brought a real sense of professionalism into the club . The girls really love the way she conducts her training sessions . Deb is really about promoting our younger talents , she likes working with the younger players . <p> Q : There 's a lot of new faces at the club . How did you go about filling four senior teams ? <p> " We had six tryouts in the end and got a good response . We picked up a few through La Trobe uni which was great for us . There 's a lot from Bendigo . Our 17-and-under and development squads are all Castlemaine girls , and we hope that flows from here on in. 
 <p> UP AND ABOUT : Brent Daniels celebrates one of his four goals for the Bendigo Pioneers in Sunday 's victory . Picture : DYLAN BURNS , BALLARAT COURIER <p> THE Bendigo Pioneers have notched their first victory of the TAC Cup season , winning Sunday 's clash against the Greater Western Victoria Rebels by 12 points . <p> The Pioneers kicked nine goals to four after half-time to win 16.12 ( 108 ) to 14.12 ( 96 ) at Ballarat 's Alfredton Recreation Reserve and square their ledger at 1-1 . <p> " Ballarat certainly took it up to us and outplayed us in the first half , but to the boys ' credit , they got going after half-time , spread a lot better , set up around the contest a lot better and we were able to get more supply down to our forward line , " Pioneers coach Rick Coburn said . <p> The Pioneers assumed control in the third quarter . <p> The Rebels formerly North Ballarat had led by 18 points at half-time , 10.5 to 7.5 , before the Pioneers added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13-point advantage . <p> " There was a bit of breeze going our way in the third quarter and we were able to capitalise on that , " Coburn said . <p> " The boys were able to get first hands on the ball , which they had been for a lot of the game , but they were a lot cleaner and the game opened up , which was to our advantage . " <p> The game was played with plenty of intensity that typified the sporting rivalry . <p> " It was a fairly bruising encounter . We had three or four boys come off with the blood rule at stages , " Coburn said . <p> " There was a fair bit of heat on the pill , which TAC Cup is n't always known for , but both sides were certainly having a crack . " <p> The best player for the Pioneers was Paddy Dow . <p> " Paddy was sensational today . He just knows how to find the footy and plays really well around the contested situation , particularly stoppages , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , booting four goals . <p> " He was our key forward today at five-foot-one . He 's a pocket rocket , very powerful and marks really well for a smaller player .

 <h> FIRST MONTH <h> LAST FIVE YEARS <p> GIVEN the way the second half of the season unfolded last year , there 's plenty of cause for optimism at Eaglehawk heading into 2017 . <p> From winning just three of their first nine games , the Hawks got themselves on a roll and , from seemingly nowhere , stormed through to a preliminary final playing an exciting brand of football led by youth . <p> They fell one step short of making the grand final , but shape as being one of the buzz sides of the competition this year under new coach and 2010 Michelsen medallist Josh Bowe , who has returned to Canterbury Park from Western Australia . <p> While the departure of Shaun Knott is a key loss , there are forward line additions with the return of Sean Williams , who kicked 90 goals in his previous two years at the Hawks , and former Bendigo Pioneer Riley Saunders , who has crossed from Golden Square , will provide some bite inside 50 . <p> The Hawks also welcome back James Baird , while utility Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If the Hawks can pick up from where they left off last season , an exciting year looks ahead at Eaglehawk , which also has its new Canterbury Park facilities . <p> Those gains have been complemented by the addition of Brianna Richardson , from Calivil United , and former Marong coach Megan Bagnell , who was fourth in last season 's Loddon Valley league best and fairest behind 's Laura Hicks . <p> They join an already talented squad that includes one of the the competition 's brightest young defender Elly Lawton , who finished top six in the 2016 Betty Thompson Medal vote count , midcourter Eleisha Lay and Dayna McGough . <p> But the Eagles will do without 2012 premiership player Christie Rogers , who is recovering from injury . <p> A vastly improved A-grade squad will be guided by a first-class coach in former Papua New Guinean international and Queensland Firebirds player Mali Roberts . <p> She took Strathfieldsaye to a grand final in 2015 in her previous stint in the BFNL and there is every reason to believe she can do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured two pre-season tournament wins under Roberts , in the Bendigo Mazda Five-a-side competition and the Rochester Invitational. 
 <h> Big Little Lies finale : Why this is the most powerful television you 'll see all year <p> It led us to believe , initially at least , that it was a sexy , glossy drama about petty rivalries in an affluent suburb , with pushy mothers battling each other for superiority in the pecking order , where the superficial trumps substance . <p> And now , with the airing of the final of its seven episodes , it has emerged as anything but squabbles among middle-class women with fabulous hair and nice houses . <p> It has proven to be a brutal , chilling insight into domestic violence and its lonely , hidden horrors - and the show belongs to Nicole Kidman and her staggeringly affecting portrayal of Celeste and the insidious trauma of her world . <p> It is hard to imagine television more powerful this year than the conclusion of Big Little Lies . <p> It was Kidman who initially got in touch with Big Little Lies Australian author Liane 2014 and went on to co-produce it under her Blossom Films banner alongside Reese Witherspoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundantly delivered on its aim of depicting real experiences of mulit-dimensional women - the good parts , the bad , the flawless and the flawed . It also meets the drive to deliver a rare vehicle engendering staggeringly excellent performances by women - and not just the lead roles , but all of the female characters . <p> Witherspoon 's plain-talking , sharp-tongued Madeline has provided much of the show 's biting humour , as she negotiates her way through motherhood and an unsatisfying marriage . <p> Shailene Woodley 's vulnerable Jane serves up much of the narrative thrust of the show as she battles the daily struggle of life as a single mum and rape survivor . <p> It 's a path that leads us , at the long-awaited trivia night , to a conclusion that shows women as an instinctively , unshakeable , unifying force . <p> And as the true story unfolds , the tension is ramped up by the immense skill of director Jean-Marc Vallee ( who previously collaborated with Witherspoon on another work about flawed but empowered women in movie Wild ) and screenwriter David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the episode begins , there is a shot for several moments of a bathroom window with the blinds drawn . We ca n't see in but if we strain we can just make out the sounds of violence and distress inside and the hidden brutality of what goes on behind closed doors . <p> It cuts to a cowering Celeste on the bathroom floor , hair all tousled , lying in the foetal position with a hand weakly outstretched towards Perry ( Alexander Skarsgard ) an exhausted , pleading signal for him to stop . <p> It 's horrifying viewing and Kidman deserves to haul in the awards for this scene alone . It 's a stark display of the isolated battle of domestic violence , the resignation and defeat of being an incapacitated heap on the floor . <p> Equally as affecting is another scene where amid the whirl of the build up to the long-awaited trivia night , with Perry and Celeste dressed up in the event 's Elvis and Audrey theme , he let 's drop that there was a call from the property manager of the apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivers the jaw-dropping bombshell completely impassively . Celeste says little , only letting the enormous gravity of what has just happened , and the sense of panic , confusion and fear about what 's to come , play out all over her face . <p> There 's also the impact on Celeste of discovering that her son Max is the one physically bullying Amabella , the daughter of Renata ( Laura Dern ) , not Jane 's son Ziggy . And it 's not the impact of her son misbehaving that upsets Celeste so , it 's the devastating realisation that despite her son never actually sees the violence in their home , he knows it 's there and it has become learned behaviour . <p> And so the fundraising trivia night becomes the unlikely catalyst that brings everything to a head . <p> " Never had a trivia night end in bloodshed before " understates one of the talking heads being interviewed by the police that weave throughout all the episodes . <p> Breaking up the tension is the slightly unfeasible talent contest , in which Madeline 's poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depicting his own futile , unrequited marriage with The Wonder of You . <p> But undercutting it all is a desperate Celeste , it becoming obvious from brief glimpses of her around the party that something is very amiss , particularly to Bonnie ( Zoe Kravitz ) , Madeleine 's ex-husband 's wife . <p> Celeste , Bonnie , Jane , Madeline and Renata are all drawn together outside when Perry comes to confront his wife . <p> In a staggering move , Jane 's horrified face reveals that Perry is her rapist , picked up instinctively , silently by the other women . It 's a shocking scene , drawn out as the impact hits home with slow-motion shots and flashbacks . <p> Time again flashes back and forth between the aftermath of the " bloodshed " and revealing what really happened . Perry meets his demise with a fall down the steps , at the hands of the least unlikely of candidates in Bonnie , but the women tell the police the same story , that he fell as he was attacking Celeste . <p> And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women and their children on the beach together : a unified , safe , if traumatised collective of survivors . <p> Big Little Lies sucked us in with glamour and tore off its shiny veneer to reveal the ugliness of the insidious , indiscriminate presence of violence and sexual assault . <p> And it gave us characters who were so richly fleshed out : human , accomplished , perfect , imperfect , scared , confused and negotiating life , marriage , parenthood and abuse in the best way they can . <p> It 's unfortunate but not unbelievable that in 2017 a drama like this would still get singled out as a novelty in featuring strong female voices leading the narrative . <p> The bottom line is it is utterly brilliant television and defies expectations in every sense . Big Little Lies led us to a collection of confronting truths and it did so with the best of storytellers , both in front of and behind the camera . Exceptional . 
 <h> Man who lost legs after ? ? ? spider bite ' on the mend , as experts say venom not to blame for infection <p> Aimee Apr 2017 , 7:11 p.m . <p> The condition of a man who lost both his legs after contracting an infection through what is thought to be a spider bite has stabilised , as experts rule out the possibility that the venom from any spider in Australia could cause a flesh-eating condition that requires amputation . <p> The condition of a man who lost both his legs after contracting an infection through what is thought to be a spider bite has stabilised , according to his family and the hospital where he is being treated . <p> After an earlier report suggested the man fell i 'll from of the bite of a white-tailed spider , experts have ruled out the possibility that the venom from any spider in Australia could cause a flesh-eating condition that requires amputation . Instead , they said , a spider bite - like any other abrasion - could serve as a " port of entry " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terry Pareja was visiting family in rural Victoria in February when he came down with a fever and noticed his foot was swollen . He went to the local medical clinic and was referred to Wimmera Base Hospital in Horsham , where , they said , doctors told them it appeared he had been bitten by a spider . <p> There , his right leg was amputated , and his spleen and part of his bowel were removed , according to his family . A spokeswoman from Wimmera Healthcare Group said the amputation had been performed " to treat a necrotising ( flesh-eating ) skin infection . " <p> Soon after , he was flown by air ambulance to The Alfred hospital in Melbourne , where his left leg was amputated , too , and he was put on a dialysis , because his kidneys were suffering , his family said . <p> Mr Pareja 's family said doctors told them he had contracted a bacterial infection that was eating away at his flesh , and that it was possible his arms might also need to be amputated . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Pareja appears to be on the mend . His family said that a surgeon at The Alfred told them Tuesday that the treatment had been effective in eliminating the bacteria from his body . <p> " We do n't believe he 's still at risk of losing his arms or other organs , " his family told Fairfax Media on Wednesday . " We 're really hoping the bacteria are no longer there . He 's improving . He 's putting up a fight . " <p> The Alfred hospital declined to comment on the exact circumstances surrounding Mr Pareja 's illness , out of respect for the patient 's privacy , but was able to confirm that his condition was now serious but stable . <h> ' Spiders do n't cause skin or limb infections ' <p> Reports on Mr Pareja 's condition raised the eyebrows of experts , who were quick to deny that spiders in Australia could cause an infection of the sort he was suffering from . <p> " Flesh-eating illnesses can not be caused by spiders , " said Ken Walker , an entomologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiders can cause ulcerated wounds was debunked years ago , he said . " They can not . " <p> Rather , he said , Mr Pareja 's condition sounded like it bore similarity to the Bairnsdale ulcer ( also known as Buruli ulcer ) , which is an infectious disease that can result in extensive damage to human flesh . <p> Bairnsdale ulcer is caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans , which can be found in soil , he explained . <p> " Because it 's in the soil , all you need is an open wound and you can get these Mycobacterium ulcerans , " he said . " And they 're necrotising , which means the skin and flesh dies and has to be removed through skin grafts or amputation . " <p> Dr Kenneth Winkel , the former director of the Australian Venoms Research Centre at Melbourne University , was also doubtful Mr Pareja 's condition was caused by the spider 's venom . <p> " There is no history of specific skin or limb infections consistently caused by spider bites in Australia , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or bacterial infections occurring after Australian spider bites but this is a risk for any skin wound . Mycobacterial infections , AKA the Bairnsdale or Buruli ulcer , do not present in the same manner as this patient and have not been attributed to spider bites . Such ulcers are painless and slow growing . " <p> Dr Winkel said a spider 's bite , like that of any animal , " may have simply been a port of entry for a flesh eating bacteria to infect his body . " <p> The hospitals that have treated Mr. Pareja declined to name the infection they believe he is suffering from . <p> While most spider bites cause local pain , Dr Winkel added , anyone who notices they have been bitten by a spider should act quickly to sanitise the wound and keep it clean , so as to avoid infection .

 <h> Time to reflect on how our city uses art <p> EDITORIAL : Many have remarked on the emptiness of Charing Cross since Marilyn 's departure . <p> MANY have remarked on the emptiness of Charing Cross since Marilyn 's departure . <p> The centre of our city is indeed beautiful in her absence , but Marilyn gave the space new life . She brought with her an energy the CBD had not seen in many years . <p> And she brought people to that space who may otherwise never have found a reason to stop there . <p> It was always going to be a challenge for Bendigo Art Gallery to fill Marilyn 's shoes -- but the latest installation in Rosalind Park not only gives Bendigo a chance to reflect on how the space was previously used for art , but also consider the many ways it can be used in the future . <p> So impressed by the space are artists Christian Wagstaff and Keith Courtney they have declared Rosalind Park the best backdrop for their work to date . <p> " We thought we 'd maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fifth city and the most spectacular location , " Courtney said . <p> " It really is beautiful here , of all the locations we 've been in it just looks knockout here in Bendigo .

But perhaps more beautiful will be the experience of those daring to venture through the House of Mirrors . <p> While some may find themselves anxious and desperate for a way out , others will see humour and embrace their sense of fun . <p> Those reactions are part of the experience , the artists say . <p> " This whole blend of joy and fear 's quite an amazing thing to watch on people 's faces , like in an amusement park , so it 's really fun to watch people 's different reactions to it , " Wagstaff said . <p> " People use different muscles in their faces that you do n't normally expect .

 <h> ' Lost the biggest bet ' : Gambling king convicted of insider trading <p> Four times , US authorities went after famed Las Vegas sports gambler Billy Walters , and four times he emerged victorious . On Friday , his luck turned . <p> Four times , authorities went after famed Las Vegas sports gambler William T. Walters , and four times the man known as Billy emerged victorious . <p> But on Friday , Walters ' luck turned , as a federal jury in Manhattan convicted him on fraud and conspiracy charges in one of the biggest insider trading trials in years . <p> " To say that I was surprised would be the understatement of my life , " Walters , 70 , told reporters as he left the courtroom . <p> " If I would have made a bet I would have lost . I just did lose the biggest bet of my life . Frankly I 'm in total shock . " <p> His lawyer , Barry Berke , said he would appeal the verdict . <p> Walters , one of the most successful professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latest case against him of using non-public information from Thomas Davis , a board member of Dean Foods of Dallas , to make more than $US40 million from 2008 to 2014 by realising profits and avoiding losses . <p> The investigation into Walters ' activities and subsequent trial drew in prominent figures like Carl Icahn , the billionaire investor and unpaid adviser to President Donald Trump , and Phil Mickelson , the champion professional golfer . <h> Swift decision <p> The conviction of Walters lifted something of a cloud that had hung over the US attorney 's office in Manhattan since December 2014 , when a federal appeals court threw out the insider trading convictions of two hedge fund managers . That ruling led prosecutors to vacate the convictions and guilty pleas of several other people . <p> The verdict against Walters was also a coda to a series of insider trading prosecutions led by Preet Bharara , the former US attorney for the Southern District of New York who was fired days before the trial began . <p> The jurors in Walters ' case reached their decision after deliberating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swift decision in a trial that lasted 14 days spread over four weeks . <p> The quickness of the verdict vindicated the government 's trial strategy , including a decision to give a central role to Davis , an acknowledged embezzler and philanderer who had pleaded guilty to several offences connected to the insider trading scheme . <p> Davis , the government 's main witness , had his credibility repeatedly called into question by lawyers for Walters . The defense team said Walters had been falsely implicated by Davis , who was desperate to escape punishment for his own misdeeds . <p> One juror interviewed outside the federal courthouse in lower Manhattan where the trial was held said that he and the rest of the jury had not been swayed by that argument . <p> " We looked at his credibility , " the juror , Lonnie Drinks , said of Davis . " Everything was factored . " <p> Walters was convicted of 10 charges of securities fraud , wire fraud and conspiracy , the most serious of which carry a potential sentence of up to 20 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Walters made huge , perfectly timed trades , at times accounting for over a third of the trading volume in Dean Foods stock , " Joon Kim , the acting US attorney in Manhattan , said in a statement . <p> " In engaging in his yearslong stock fraud scheme , Walters underestimated law enforcement 's resolve to pursue and catch those who cheat the market . " <p> Walters , who was once profiled by " 60 Minutes " because of his betting prowess , was not the only big name to come up during his trial . <h> The Icahn connection <p> Icahn emerged in testimony and court filings as having had frequent discussions with Walters . A broker for Walters testified on cross-examination that some of Walter 's stock-trading ideas had come from Icahn , who was not charged with wrongdoing . <p> During a hearing outside the presence of the jury , one of Walters ' lawyers told the judge that Walters and Icahn were friends . <p> The lawyer , Paul Schoeman , added : " Mr. Walters has a long history of investing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in . " <p> Mickelson was also mentioned during the trial as someone who had traded in Dean Foods shares and once owed nearly $US2 million in gambling debts to Walters . <p> Mickelson made roughly $US1 million trading Dean Foods shares ; he agreed to forfeit those profits in a related civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission . <p> Known as " Lefty " for his left-handed stroke , Mickelson was not criminally charged . Though he was once seen as a potential witness at Walters ' trial , he was never called to testify . <h> Tips on the Bat Phone <p> Prosecutors said that Walters had tried to hide his actions by supplying Davis with a prepaid mobile phone called the Bat Phone to use while conveying secret information and by sometimes speaking in code . <p> During the trial , prosecutors displayed phone logs and trading records , and an agent with the FBI testified that Walters sometimes made major trades within moments of speaking with Davis on the phone . <p> For instance , the agent testified , Davis and Walters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2008 beginning at 12:54 pm . At 1:05 pm , Walters bought 462,200 shares of Dean Foods stock for about million . <p> Davis provided Walters with secret Dean Food information about future earnings statements , the planned purchase of another company and a pending initial public offering , prosecutors said . <p> At the same time , Walters arranged for loans of nearly $US1 million to Davis , who had financial problems and repaid only a small portion of what he borrowed , prosecutors said . <h> ' Babe Ruth of Risk ' <p> Defense lawyers offered a contrasting account . They said that Walters was a skilled and fearless trader , referred to by one of his brokers as " the Babe Ruth of Risk , " who did not need inside information . Davis , Walters ' lawyers said , was trying to save himself by maligning Walters . <p> The competing narratives were on display throughout the trial . Davis testified that he had acted as a " virtual conduit " of secrets and had supplied Walters with an " enormous " amount of information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided him with the Bat Phone to use while communicating about Dean Foods , adding that later he had thrown it into a creek after federal agents visited his home . <p> Davis also testified that Walters sometimes spoke in code , using " Dallas Cowboys " to refer to Dean Foods and asking " How 's the milkman doing ? " when inquiring about the company , then the country 's largest dairy processor . <p> Defense lawyers cross-examined Davis at length , eliciting acknowledgments that he had been squeezed for money , had taken $US100,000 from a charity he ran , had mislabelled expenses on his taxes and had lied to many people , including investigators with the SEC . <p> Walters ' lawyers suggested that Davis had misled prosecutors about his sports gambling habits and his contact with prostitutes , at one point reading into the record phone numbers for escort services in Chicago , Denver , New York and San Francisco that Davis , who told prosecutors he had not hired prostitutes in recent years , had called in 2010 , 2011 and 2014 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " so-called Bat Phone , " which was never recovered , pointing out that Davis had first told prosecutors that it was black before then testifying at trial that it was maroon . 
 <h> North 's ominous start to flag defence in win <p> NORTH Bendigo has wasted no time in again asserting its authority on the Heathcote District league , crushing Heathcote by 187 points in round one on Saturday . <p> IMPRESSIVE DEBUT : Recruit Sean Christopher kicked 11 goals in his first game for White Hills against Elmore on Saturday . Pictures : LUKE WEST <p> The two-time defending premiers , who are the red-hot favourites to make it three in a row this year , put the Saints to the sword in brutal style , but it could have been much worse had the Bulldogs kicked straight . <p> The Bulldogs scored 63 times to the Saints ' six in their 28.35 ( 203 ) to 2.4 ( 16 ) shellacking at Pigeon Park in a result that shows the gulf between the flag favourites and likely wooden-spooners . <p> " Heathcote us and spread better at times during the first half and we did n't help ourselves with some inaccurate kicking with 9.16 , " North Bendigo coach Rob Bennett said . <p> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our style of footy in the second half . " <p> Of the Bulldogs ' score of 203 , they kicked 84 in the third quarter when they booted 12.12 while keeping the Saints scoreless . <p> The Bulldogs who have a percentage of 1268.7 shared their 28 goals around , with no player kicking more than five . <p> Jarrod Findlay and Brady Herdman each booted five , while Sean Morris , Sam Barnes and recruit Joel Helman chipped in with four apiece . <p> In his first game for the Bulldogs , Lachlan Ford was outstanding through the midfield , while Tyson Findlay was a clearance machine , particularly in the second half , and Ash Craig after a year out of the game returned without missing a beat . <p> It was a tough initiation to coaching for Heathcote 's Luke Bell . <p> " The first half we were able to make it a bit harder for them to get the ball forward from stoppages and our intensity around the footy was very good , but our third quarter was disappointing when we started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We know we 've got to start at the bottom to turn this around and days like today are going to happen against quality like North ... it 's certainly not going to be the only scoreline like that they have for the year . <p> " North was super well-drilled , and even when they were 25 goals up they were still so demanding of each other . <p> " That 's where we 're aiming to be in a couple of years and for a lot of our young guys today was a very big learning curve . " <p> Darcy McLean on a wing and Louis Picollo both fought gallantly all game for the Saints , who were beaten by more than 100 points for the fifth time in their past seven meetings with the Bulldogs . <p> * A rejuvenated White Hills has made a promising start , belting the team whose position in the top five they will be eyeing off -- Elmore . <p> The Demons won by 98 points , 25.13 ( 163 ) to 9.11 ( 65 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11-goal haul on debut from Sean Christopher . <p> Christopher became the first White Hills play since Brad McConnell in round 11 , 2007 , to kick a double-figure bag of goals . <p> " It 's good to get off to a nice start given we did n't know much about what Elmore was going to hit us with , " new Demons coach Brent Millar said . <p> " Elmore was young and energetic and stayed with us well for the first half , but we were able to get on top and it was pleasing the way the boys were able to finish off . " <p> Christopher spent last year playing in the reserves with SANFL club Glenelg . <p> " He 's clearly a very good player , but you 've got to have the supply to him . He could have kicked a couple more , but we hurt him a bit a few times going forward , " Millar said . <p> " His presence in the forward line was fantastic and it 's obviously good to have that focal point . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demons had nine other goalkickers , including Lachlan Furness , who slotted five . <p> On a sour note for the Demons Jake Ward suffered a dislocated shoulder and Jake Dickens injured an ankle early in the game . <p> Like Christopher , new ruckman Lachlan Sidebottom also made a big first-up impression for the Demons , and Matt Lehane , who played on Bloods ' coach Danny Brewster , made a welcome return in his first game since July , 2015 , following a knee injury . <p> Tyler Oliver , Matt Gilmour and Nathan Brewster were good players for the Bloods , who did n't kick their first goal until the second quarter . 
 <p> 'S quest for a third successive Heathcote District league A-grade netball title is off to a winning start . <p> The Grasshoppers dug deep to overcome Gunbower by three goals at Leitchville on Saturday . <p> They faced a spirited challenge by the Bombers , who trailed by seven goals early in the contest , but regrouped to narrowly go down 53-50 . <p> It was a fresh-look Colbinabbin , which featured only two players - coach Liz and captain Olivia McEvoy - from last season 's premiership line-up . <p> A raft of injuries , including to Gabby Barlow and Lou Dupuy , allowed the Grasshoppers to introduce first-gamers Jamison Lowe , who played a full game in wing defence , and Zena Wareham , who played the second half in goals . <p> said both had acquitted themselves well against a Bombers team that she expected to challenge strongly for a top three position . <p> " Zena played half a game on Jodie Lake , who is probably the best defender in the league , " she said . <p> " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was really happy with her game and it will be good to keep working with her over the next few weeks . She 'll be a great senior player down the track . " <p> Back from a stint at Bendigo league club Golden Square , Holly Guerra wasted little time making an impression to win the nod as the Grasshoppers ' best player . <p> " She was really good in defence , got a lot of intercepts and was really tough and physical , " Cobbledick said . <p> " She made a huge difference for us . <p> " If we lost the ball down in attack , she worked really hard to bring the ball back . " <p> The Grasshoppers were also well served by McEvoy , who played the first half of the game in goals , before moving back into her traditional midcourt role . <p> debuted youngsters in Courtney West and Brereton , with both winning impressing the opposition coach . <p> " I think Jodie ( Lake ) was really good for them , you could see she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " I think it 's so important for those young girls to come up and play A-grade netball as soon as they can . <p> " It 's great to see we have so many good juniors coming through this league .

 <h> Cyclone Debbie coal disruption set to ease <p> Brian Apr 2017 , 7:24 p.m . <p> The lingering impact of Cyclone Debbie on Queensland 's exports of coal will begin to ease this week for some exporters as work is expedited to repair the multiple rail links which shift the millions of tonnes of coal to port . <p> The lingering impact of Cyclone Debbie on Queensland 's coal exports will begin to ease later in the week for some exporters as work is expedited to repair the multiple rail links that shift the millions of tonnes of coal to port . <p> Queensland supplies an estimated 15 per cent of the global demand for good-quality coking coal , and the widespread mine closures from Cyclone Debbie prompted some coal traders to speculate the supply disruptions could rival that of Cyclone Yasi ? ? ? in 2011 , when the spot price of coking coal topped $US400 a tonne for a time . <p> Even though the share prices of some coal producers such as Whitehaven Coal surged on news of the latest cyclone , brokers and analysts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on coal prices may be transitory . <p> Earlier this week , miners such as BHP Billiton and Glencore declared force majeure , which released them from contractual supply commitments due to forces beyond their control . <p> The Insurance Council has indicted total losses from the cyclone are expected to top $1 billion , a figure expected to be conservative . <p> China 's large coal users had built up stockpiles at ports , which limited the price spike resulting from the latest cyclone . There have been some spot trades of coking coal at around a tonne for coking coal while the price of steaming coal shipped from Newcastle rose to around $US90 a tonne from $US80 a tonne , according to IHS McCloskey . Coking coal is used in steelmaking , with steaming coal mostly used in the electricity industry . <p> The flooding in Rockhampton has slowed the expected restart of the railway lines linking the Blackwater area coal mines to the port , to Monday , rather than Sunday , although capacity constraints will remain , Aurizon warned late last week . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some reduced capacity , " it said . " Recovery and repairs are being undertaken at multiple sites along the Blackwater corridor . " <p> The railway link from Moura to Gladstone is expected to be restored by this Wednesday , a week earlier than originally expected , with the resumption of shipments along the Newland link to the Abbot Point export terminal also brought forward a week to this Friday , as repairs continue at several sites along the line , it said . <p> The worst affected line remains the link from Goonyella to the Dalrymple Bay and Hay Point terminals , which will take an estimated five weeks to repair . <p> Mines that use the western sections of the Goonyella system may be able to ship some tonnes north to Abbot Point or south through the Blackwater system to the Port of Gladstone , Aurizon said . Repairs around the Black Mountain section of track are expected to be completed by Tuesday , it said , which should give most mines in the area the ability to shift some tonnages to the re-routed port , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
 <h> Mud delights some of us more than others <p> Wayne Apr 2017 , 6 p.m . <p> BUSHWHACKED As you know , it rained last weekend - which for us was both a good thing and a bad thing . <p> As you know , it rained last weekend which for us was both a good thing and a bad thing . Good , because the rainwater tanks were down to the bottom rung and the Bureau of Meteorology was n't predicting any tank-fillers for months . Bad , because in our area , every time it rains it leads to nocturnal people wanting to test their four-wheel-driving prowess in the bush next door . <p> Sometimes , often about 2-3am , we 'll hear this distressed roaring and raging in the bush , probably similar to the sounds of mating dinosaurs . It can go on for hours , as people bog their vehicles in the mud wallows they have created . <p> Occasionally , we have taken the dogs out for a bushwalk the next day only to find vehicles bogged so badly you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying on its side in the mud like a felled white wildebeest . On another occasion , a once nice , high-spec Commodore was found in the middle of a mucky wallow its front and back bumpers ripped off and the entire cabin half filled with watery clay . <p> I should have said this is in a designated bushland reserve , about 5km from the centre of Bendigo . It 's not on some remote , outback bit of scrub . <p> We 've had some talks with Parks Victoria about this . <p> And even though the local staff are nice people who care passionately about the natural environment , it seems money to either stop the midnight rumblers , or to repair the damage they 've done , never seems to be available . <p> There was talk last year of filling in the growing lakes and canyons with gravel and digging some drains , but that did n't happen . <p> One piece of advice from the Parks folk was to get the neighbourhood motivated , and we 've touched base with a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we are and do n't know what to do about it either . <p> Parks Victoria also advised us not to actively discourage the activity , but to report it to the cops . <p> Done that a few times , along with calls about unregistered monkeybikes with unlicensed kids ripping along public roads to get into the bush to tear it up a bit more . <p> Signs went up . They 've been about as effective as standing outside the White House with a sign saying : " Errr , be nice to Australia , Mr Trump " . <p> One morning this week , out in the New Bayou , a thought occurred : a bloke should not whinge so much . There 's always an upside . In this case , it 's the contagious , unmitigated glee of the two corgis , who seem to think these marvellous mud-baths are created seasonally just for their doggy pleasure . They leap into the knee-deep ruts and hollows like furry dolphins , sometimes with just their eyeballs and ears above water and charge their way back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like nothing so much as four-legged lamingtons . So that 's something . <p> Also this week , we came across a new variation on the mud-pluggers . It looked as though someone had rammed a four-wheel-drive through thick scrub , flattening it for about 30m . At the end of this instant new track , they 'd left their mark . <p> An old mattress , a busted microwave , a snapped off timber bollard , a worn-out chair , piles of old papers and assorted other sacrificial domestic offerings to the gods of the bushland reserve . <p> Mrs Whacked surveyed the damage and remarked it probably would have been easier and cheaper if they 'd taken it to the tip . 
 <h> Opportunities to lead <p> PLANS to assist the Karen community in Bendigo could see the regional city thrust into the national spotlight . <p> Community leader the Venerable Ashin has shouldered the responsibility for plans to build a Karen Burmese Buddhist monastery in Bendigo . <p> The Buddhist monk , based in Long Gully , has also identified a need for a Karen medical clinic and a Karen aged care centre . <p> He believes Bendigo will be leading the way in all three projects . <p> The monastery plans have been keeping him busy , but the Venerable said he intends to apply for planning permits for the medical clinic and aged care centre as soon as he the project is complete . <p> The city is home to about 1000 Karen people , the majority of whom were resettled in Australia as refugees following a protracted civil war in Myanmar . <p> Wednesday marks 10 years since the first Karen family moved to Bendigo . <p> Bendigo is now estimated to be home to more than 1000 Karen people , City of Greater Bendigo community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn more once the data from the most recent Census is released . <p> Kaye Graves , of Bendigo Community Health Services , is proud of what the Karen people and the Bendigo community have achieved together . <p> " I see our multicultural Bendigo growing from strength to strength , " she said . <p> She said it was important the organisation continued to support people of refugee background to thrive in the Bendigo community , and that the community was open to learning about the journeys of people with a refugee background . <p> Noemi Cummings , of the Loddon Campaspe Multicultural Services , has been involved with the Karen community in Bendigo since the beginning . <p> " Bendigo is a much richer place because of the Karen people being here , " she said . <p> But the Karen community still faces challenges , such as language barriers . <p> For more about the monastery plans , see next week 's Bendigo Advertiser .

Demand treatment ! <p> Renewable energy is the doctor 's prescription for better health . The world needs to move away from electricity generated from coal and gas . It 's polluting our air and producing greenhouse gases causing global warming . <p> The federal government 's State of the Environment report estimates 3000 deaths are caused by urban air pollution in Australia each year -- more than the national road toll . Based on the sources of pollution in urban areas , up to half of these deaths can be attributed to the burning of coal . This means every wind farm or solar installation -- whether it be on your roof or large scale the size of a small town -- is saving lives . <p> Thousands suffer heart and lung diseases from this air pollution at great cost to health services . Yes , coal is cheap but only because it 's subsidised by the health costs paid by thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeks to bring health benefits of renewable solar and wind energy to many rural and regional communities . In Port Augusta , South Australia we helped the community close a coal power station that caused lung cancer and asthma . A solar thermal plant is now foreshadowed .

Barcaldine , in central west Queensland , has just installed the state 's largest solar plant , which according the mayor Rob Chandler has " brought a lot of dollars into the community . " <p> The best thing about this medicine is there are no negative side effects . Anxieties have arisen over wind farms , but no medical or scientific organisation here or overseas has identified any cause or harm .

 <h> Wedding of Emily Tippett and Luke McKenzie <p> The meeting : We met in October 2012 at The Boardwalk Bendigo where Luke worked as a waiter . We were introduced by Luke 's former manager and my boss/brother , Chris ( little did Luke know at this stage that Chris and I were related ) . <p> The proposal : Luke surprised me with a helicopter ride that took us over the islands of Fiji . A lazy morning to begin , we started getting ready for their flight . We headed down to the entrance of our resort and waited until our shuttle bus arrived . <p> We were taken out of the resort area of Fiji and to patch of land that had a tiny building as the office and a landing patch for the helicopter . <p> We were invited inside the office to fill out some forms , then headed to the helicopter where our pilot introduced himself and began listing instructions . <p> Then we were off ! - Luke scared of heights , was a bit apprehensive but as soon as we headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing Fiji really is . The views were outstanding ! <p> Eventually getting closer to a sand bar , the pilot did however blurt out that this particular sand bar is famous for loves notes and that he knew Luke really wanted to go see it .... This tipped me off a little until ... The message written was : " Julie Will You Marry Me " , my initial reaction to this was how cute someone is proposing . Until Luke told me that it was meant to say ' Emily ' . However , this is n't where the proposal took place as I was then left uncertain and in denial that was the truth . <p> The helicopter landed on the sand bar moments later . This is when it finally started to hit me , this was real ! This was actually happening ! As I got out of the helicopter and turned around to Luke , he was kneeling down on one knee with a ring in his hand ready to propose . <p> Truly romantic , after I had said yes to Luke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... A Fijian was waiting for them to go to her so she could pop a bottle of champagne to celebrate the newly engaged couple . <p> The wedding day : We married in beautiful gardens of Bram Leigh Receptions , Croydon by Michael Anderson Civil Celebrant .

 <h> $91 million to signalling , track works will improve rail services in Bendigo , transport minister says <p> Works on train lines between Bendigo and Echuca will form part of the state government budget for the next financial year , Victoria 's premier and transport minister have said . <p> A $91 million cash injection will see signalling upgrades and track works carried out along the Bendigo line , part of what the government is calling its " regional rail revival " package . <p> Premier Daniel Andrews and Bendigo East representative Jacinta Allan revealed the almost $1.5 billion rail investment on Sunday ahead of this week 's budget announcement , a move they said would create 1000 new jobs . <p> Work done to the signalling systems between Bendigo , Eaglehawk and Epsom would allow the government to meet its obligations under the Bendigo Metro project , the transport minister said . <p> " This will mean we can deliver extra services , " Ms Allan said . <p> Track work from Bendigo to Echuca will mean travelling speeds will increase along the route , shortening travel times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Echuca services have failed to meet punctuality targets for five consecutive months and buses replaced all trains between Bendigo and the northern town for most of April while track works were completed . <p> " It 's the next step in the dedicated train system we 're building for Bendigo , and our revival of rail in Victoria 's north and across the state , " Ms Allan said . <p> The state government last year added extra peak-hour services for Bendigo and implemented the first stage of Bendigo Metro , adding 10 weekday services to Epsom station and more mid-week trips to Kangaroo Flat . <p> The government also announced last month its late night coach trial to Bendigo would be made permanent . <p> The package will be funded by a $1.46 billion Victorian entitlement from the federal government 's asset recycling initiative , one which gives 15 per cent of asset sales back to the states . <p> Victoria 's is owed the money after the sale of the Port of Melbourne , although there was some disagreement last year between the two tiers of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Victoria 's money , " Ms Allan said . <p> " It 's what we 're entitled to it under a partnership that was signed ( by state and federal governments ) .

 <p> The Pioneers scored 24 times to Northern 's 17 , but it was the Knights ' superior accuracy that proved telling as they recorded a 12.5 ( 77 ) to 10.14 ( 74 ) victory . <p> Despite a third loss in a row that left the Pioneers with a 1-4 record , coach Rick Coburn was upbeat about his side 's performance . <p> " I thought we played very well today for large parts of the game , " Coburn said . <p> " Even though we 've had a win and been competitive in our first four games , I have n't felt we 've played overly well to this point . <p> " But today we structured up really well and the boys teamed and gelled quite well . <p> " We just were n't as efficient as we would liked to have been with that last kick going inside 50 , which was probably the difference in the game . " <p> Coburn attributed the inability for the Pioneers to deliver consistent clean delivery inside forward 50 to the inaccurate scoreline , which continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more behinds than goals in four of its five games . <p> " A lot of those shots we missed were from wide and a reasonable distance out , which goes back to that last kick inside 50 and needing to get it into the corridor a bit more and getting some deeper entries , " Coburn said . <p> " But overall , the effort of the boys was really good . They ran the game out well and came home really hard , but just could n't get over the line .

 <p> News that regional businesses will now face the lowest payroll tax rates in the country was music to the ears of Bendigo 's business community on Tuesday . <p> In handing down the 2017-18 state budget , Treasurer Tim Pallas announced payroll tax cuts for 38,000 businesses across Victoria from July 1 , along with a higher tax-free threshold . <p> For businesses " based primarily in regional Victoria " , the rate will decrease from 4.85 per cent to 3.65 per cent . <p> In Bendigo , that equates to a 25 per cent cut , and chief executive officer Leah Sertori said it was a win for local enterprise . <p> " , on behalf of our members , has been advocating for investment in supporting small business in a number of different areas for some time and one of those really important ones is reducing payroll tax , " she said . <p> " We think that 's sending a really important signal to business to have confidence in operating in Victoria that this is a state government that really recognises the impost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too low a threshold . " <p> Consistent with a pre-budget survey of members which named a redeveloped court precinct as a top priority , Ms Sertori said businesses were also pleased with a $3.9 million commitment to " develop plans to address current and future demand pressures " . <p> " At the moment a number of our members are engaged in Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal hearings that all take place in Melbourne so whenever they need to go to VCAT it 's a whole day out from Bendigo , " she said . <p> " And the legal fraternity here have a degree of expertise that 's really on par with firms operating in a metropolitan context now so they could represent clients and support cases right across the region if Bendigo had a fit-for-purpose court facility , so today 's announcement of $3.9 million for the detailed planning phase of a new court facility for Bendigo is really welcome .

 <h> Editorial : Decentralisation should not be a gimmick <p> Any relocation of government jobs must be accompanied by a strong business case . <p> MOVING jobs out of the big smoke was central to the creation of Canberra . <p> The country 's capital city was formed after Sydney and Melbourne politicians could not agree on which metropolis should become the centre for public administration in Australia . <p> The Victorian capital hosted the national parliament from its first sitting in 1901 to 1927 when it shifted to the Australian Capital Territory . In the decades afterwards government departments and their staff were relocated to a city that was described as a " good sheep paddock spoiled " . <p> Now the Coalition government , and particularly its rural Nationals MPs , have a driving passion for moving jobs away from Canberra into country areas . <p> Decentralisation , as it is known , is being promoted by deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce , with the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority shifting to Armidale in his northern NSW seat . <p> It is a move that has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a politician with considerable sway in his party . <p> Even APVMA employees are dead-set against relocating some 750km north from sleepy Canberra to positively comatose Armidale . <p> In fact , just last month APVMA employees were given some " talking points " to help them navigate awkward questions during so-called " BBQ conversations " over Easter . Those who remain unsure about their future were coached to answer with " For the moment , I 'm getting on with the job and considering the information on the transition as it 's provided " . <p> Employees who are almost certain to relocate were encouraged to say " I 'm listening to what our executive have to say about the transition , but for the moment I 'm getting on with the job " in response to queries from people they " love and trust " . <p> There is no doubt every regional area would welcome an influx of highly skilled and well-paid workers .

 <h> Editorial : New bail laws alone not the answer to crime <p> Editorial : New bail laws will serve a purpose , but boosting our prison population comes at a cost . <p> Following January 's horrendous incident in the Bourke Street Mall and the fact the perpetrator was out on bail , it was inevitable a public outcry would demand a shake-up of the bail system . <p> Measures announced this week form part of the government 's response to a bail review which followed . <p> The shock of that single incident , seemingly out of the blue and with so many innocent victims , has the shattering feeling of randomness which instils a sense of public panic and hopelessness . <p> In a climate of increasing politicisation of this feeling , the state government has responded to the review by Supreme Court Justice Paul Coghlan , who made 37 recommendations following the incident . <p> State Attorney-General Martin Pakula says the reforms will include a presumption against bail for serious violent , sexual and driving offences . <p> Police will gain greater powers to hold people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most serious cases . Bail will be refused for aggravated home invasion and aggravated carjacking , along with a presumption against bail for rape and armed robbery . <p> The point of all this , according to the Attorney-General , is magistrates and judges will have to place a higher priority on community safety when making bail decisions . <p> Naturally the opposition is n't happy and has labelled the changes cosmetic . But perhaps an even greater compromise to public safety would be the glib assertion that changing a step in the justice system will make the wider criminal problem go away . <p> In four years Victoria 's remand population grew from under 1000 to 2300 people . The courts are clogged and Corrections Victoria has struggled to find places for them and even deliver them to court -- all to the frustration of magistrates and judges . <p> Nationally over the last five years , unsentenced prisoner numbers in Australia have increased 81 percent . By September 2016 , the average number of full-time prisoners was 38,998 , with almost a third unsentenced , a ratio that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brazil and Thailand . Moreover during this time the crime rate has increased . <p> Apart from the issue of recidivism , which increased prison populations foster , ignoring mental health and drug use will cost and compromise public safety more in the long run . 
 <h> ' Lansell Crest ' fiercely opposed by locals <p> The Lansell Crest development in East Bendigo has been fiercely opposed by locals . <p> SET TO TRANSFORM : The block of empty land between Lansell and Lloyd streets could become home to more than 100 mixed-size homes in the future . <p> The first test case for Bendigo 's medium-density housing future has been scorned by locals , with unsightly " dog boxes " likely to create a " ghetto-style " neighbourhood that will attract crime , according to a number of public submissions . <p> The Lansell Crest development in East Bendigo , which would see more than 100 new homes fill an empty block close to the city , has been fiercely opposed by close to 100 residents through submissions to the City of Greater Bendigo . <p> Many cited poor living conditions , the associations of high-density housing to crime , and traffic chaos as their objections to the development , which would have 104 dwellings , ranging from two to five-bedroom houses . <p> A planning application was adjusted last year by developer Damien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the council released public submissions to the proposal on Thursday ahead of the council meeting on May 17 . <p> Crest is the first of a number of sites identified by the City of Greater Bendigo for potential medium-density housing developments in the Greater Bendigo residential strategy 2014 . <p> The strategy resolved to " strongly support " the provision of medium-density housing , given more than 50 per cent of households in Bendigo were one or two-person occupied . <p> Mr Tangey said the city 's residential strategy encouraged him to amend the number of planned houses . <p> " There is a demand for a more diverse ( housing ) product , " he said . <p> Given the volume of submissions , councillors -- at a council meeting on May 17 -- will likely vote to request an independent , state government panel to consider the submissions , and act as an advisory committee . <h> Planning minister to have final say <p> The state government planning minister will have the final say on the first large-scale medium-density housing project in Bendigo . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greater Bendigo councillors can overrule during a vote at a council meeting . <p> A council vote can in turn be overruled by the sitting planning minister , who has the final say . <p> An overlay of the potential development . Source : The City of Greater Bendigo . <p> A concluding decision on the project , which could set a precedent for medium-density housing developments in the future , is expected in late 2018 or early 2019 . <p> The block at 39-51 Lansell Street -- which extends back onto Lloyd Street -- was formerly the Bendigo Abattoir and Country Roads Board , but all buildings have been demolished and the land decontaminated . <p> The Greater Bendigo residential strategy adopted in 2014 identifies the Lansell Street site as a " key development site " for the city . <p> In July 2016 , the previous City of Greater Bendigo council voted to put a planning scheme amendment which would allow the project to go ahead on public display . <p> Mr Tangey said his company had developed a " vision for the reuse of an inner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of housing choices for current and future generations " . <p> The Birchgrove Property Managing Director said a gap existed in the current market , as " 60-65 per cent of local housing was occupied by two people or less " . <p> " We do believe the proposal fits , " said Mr Tangey , acknowledging the strong opposition to his company 's plan . <p> Many of the public submissions opposing the development cite poor living conditions , the associations of ' high-density ' housing to crime , and traffic chaos . <p> The 104 lots will range in size from 85 to 350sqm , with dwellings that are single , double or triple storey . 
 <p> Being a mum is the best job in the world , say three generations of women who have celebrated Mother 's Day together . <p> Wilma Henderson , a mother of four , grandmother of 24 and great-grandmother of 35 , was joined by family including daughter Pamela Bell and granddaughter Naomi van der Leeuw for a celebratory afternoon tea on Friday . <p> With a large and growing family , Mrs Henderson said each member was special . <p> " It 's a privilege to watch them grown and develop into fine people , " the Mercy Health Bethlehem resident said . <p> A mother of 10 , Mrs Bell said she felt that being a mum was to raise a family and be a light in the world , and her mother had been a prime example of that . <p> Mrs Henderson added that it was her own mother who had instilled in her good values . <p> From her mother and grandmother , Mrs van der Leeuw said she learnt the importance of loving and caring for others . <p> " It 's absolutely special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values and morals , and just being their friend , it 's lovely , " Mrs van der Leeuw said . <p> A nurturing nature is something that the three women believe has been passed down the family line . <p> Perfectionism , too , is another trait shared by the women , as is a strong faith . <p> Mrs Bell said they were homemakers and loved the garden and sewing , something that had also been shared by her grandmother . <p> She said her mother had always been very loving towards her children and had been their " everything " in life , while Mrs Henderson said it had been a joy to be the mother to her four daughters . <p> Mrs van der Leeuw said her grandmother had been very supportive in her grandchildren 's lives and counted her mum as her best friend . <p> With many years of mothering experience between them , the three women have some advice for new mums , with Mrs van der Leeuw suggesting they appreciate every moment . <p> " Every little moment 's special and creates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , " she said . <p> Mrs Bell said it was important to support and celebrate children 's achievements , and give them plenty of time to grow up . <p> " I think it 's very important to always be there for them if they need you ... it 's a real privilege to be able to support them in lots of ways , " Mrs Henderson added . 
 <h> Bendigo Rowing Club pays tribute to life member and mentor Mavis Burnett <p> Bendigo Rowing Club has showed its appreciation for one of its life members with a touching gesture . <p> HONOUR : Bendigo Rowing Club life member Mavis Burnett with her namesake , a new lightweight quad for female rowers . <p> AFTER some 45 years of service to Bendigo Rowing Club , Mavis Burnett jokes that perhaps she has earned the honour of having a boat named after her . <p> That is exactly what the club has done , christening its new lightweight quad for female rowers after the life member and mentor . <p> The club will officially launch the Mavis Burnett , a tribute to a woman who has dedicated countless hours to the club over the years , at its annual dinner on Saturday night . <p> Mavis said the gesture came as a surprise . <p> " First of all , I thought this ca n't be right , " Mavis said . <p> " But no , I was absolutely thrilled to bits , really thrilled to bits . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the club when her children , Stephen and Joanne , started rowing as school students . <p> Prior to that , she had had no connection to the sport . <p> " I used to love coming down and watching your own children row , and then met other parents too , that were doing the same thing , " Mavis said . <p> After a few visits , she decided to join the club and never left . <p> " It has been just an absolutely wonderful group of people , " Mavis said . <p> " And what I really love about it , there 's no one in the club that thinks they 're better than anybody else , and they get on so well together ... It 's really , really lovely to know that you 're in a club that 's like that . " 
 <h> Metro patronage doubles at Eaglehawk and Epsom <p> The numbers are in on the Bendigo Metro rail project , but the PTUA says that 's not the whole picture . <p> Patronage on the Bendigo Metro rail network has more than doubled at Epsom and Eaglehawk since the project began at the start of last year , government figures show . <p> The figures , released by the Victorian Department of Economic Development , Jobs , Transport and Resources at the weekend , show 1535 people boarded the train at Epsom between January and March this year , up from 763 in the third quarter of 2015 . <p> More than 700 passengers have boarded V/Line services at Eaglehawk so far this year , up from 332 in 2015 , and Kangaroo Flat station has seen an increase of 515 passengers to 13,247 in that time . <p> Public Transport Minister and member for Bendigo East Jacinta Allan said the figures reflected the extra services the government had scheduled at the stations during the life of the project . <p> " People in those local communities have responded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there 's great use of the extra services as part of the Bendigo Metro commitment , " she said . <p> " To me I always felt that by putting on extra services , people would use them . " <p> But Public Transport Users Association regional spokesman Paul Westcott said following those passengers ' movements through the rail network was " key " to gauging the success of Bendigo Metro . <p> " It 's not so much boarding at those stations , it 's also the alighting of people who have boarded there before you can tell whether it 's working effectively as a metro or whether people are just making use of the extra station close to their home in order just to catch the train to Castlemaine or Melbourne , " he said . <p> " Until we know the actual travel pattern of people who are getting on at those stations it 's hard to know how successfully it 's working as a metro as opposed to just an extension of the Melbourne line . " <p> But Mr Westcott said the increased patronage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destination . <p> " It 's not surprising that patronage has gone up at those stations , obviously if you increase the services to stations , patronage tends to increase -- build it and they will come sort of thing , " he said . <p> " It 's good and of course it fits with the pattern of patronage growing in general on V/Line services throughout the state . " <p> Ms Allan said the figures put more pressure on the Commonwealth to stump up the cash for the state government 's $1.45 billion Regional Rail Revival package , some of which would be used to fund Bendigo Metro stage two . <p> " Part of that work includes a package around improving the signalling at Epsom and Eaglehawk and that will enable us to run more services , " she said . <p> " If we can unlock the funding Victoria 's entitled to we can get moving and deliver even more services as part of the Bendigo Metro project .

 <h> Preschool funding ' what we 'd been waiting for ' <p> The Loddon Mallee Preschool Association has welcomed a funding lifeline from the federal government , but is now calling for it to be extended past 2018 . <p> LMPA chief executive officer Phil Hocking said a recent announcement that the Commonwealth would continue to fund its share of 15 hours of childcare per week for preschool-aged children was " what we 'd been waiting for " . <p> " We 'd be happier if they had have extended it indefinitely but at least we have another 12 months and that gives families that security of knowing that the funding will still be available and we 'll still be providing 15 hours , " he said . <p> " Also from our staff 's perspective it gives them that little bit more career security . " <p> But Mr Hocking said the organisation would continue to seek a more long-term commitment from the government . <p> " We need to keep on pushing beyond 2018 now because we need to get the funding secured for the long term , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the 2018 extension of the National Partnership Agreement , which had been due to expire in December , would provide certainty and consistency for families , preschools and long day care centres . <p> " It will also allow for proper discussions with the states and territories on how we fairly guarantee at least 15 hours of preschool beyond that , given the very different models of preschool delivery that apply from one state to another , " he said . <p> Mr Birmingham said more than 2500 children in Bendigo would benefit from the government 's $3.2 million funding injection for preschool education . <p> " We 're focused on ensuring children in Bendigo and across Australia have the best possible start to their education , " he said . <p> " We know that a quality preschool education is essential for laying the foundations for successful learning , including transition to full-time school and future school success .

 <h> Essendon level crossing removal plan raises ire of locals and council <p> Clay May 2017 , 1:06 a.m . <p> Essendon level crossing removal plan sparks trench battle . <p> Another Andrews government 's level crossing removal project is under attack , this time in Essendon where locals and Moonee Valley Council are fighting to overturn a plan to put busy Buckley Street underneath the rail line . <p> Residents , traders and the council want the government to dump its preferred plan to lower the road beneath the rail line , and instead sink the railway tracks in a trench . <p> So strong is opposition to the government 's plan that Moonee Valley Council has voted to seek legal advice on challenging the government 's plans . <p> A protest meeting is planned for Sunday , and follows a meeting last month that attracted almost 500 people . <p> The boom gates at Buckley Street are down for 78 minutes over the two-hour peak morning time from 7-9 . An average of 15,000 cars cross the road each day . <p> There is widespread agreement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has become a source of fierce debate . <p> The government argues that , if it were to follow Moonee Valley Council 's preferred option , it would cost around $1 billion and see the Craigieburn line closed for up to 12 months during construction . <p> Moonee Valley mayor Andrea Surace ? ? ? said her community was " extremely disappointed " the state government had awarded a contract to builders John Holland and KBR for a level crossing removal . <p> " Local residents are rightfully outraged at the lack of community consultation on this project , " Cr Surace said . <p> She accused the government 's Level Crossing Removal Authority of " trying to keep the council and the community in the dark at every step to make it easier for them to ram through this substandard solution " . <p> The plan for the Buckley Street level crossing . <p> The council last week voted to get legal advice on how it could challenge the plan , what it would cost , and the likelihood of success . Moonee Valley was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to build the East West Link . <p> Roz Shaw is the spokeswoman for a local resident and traders group that is fighting the level crossing authority 's plan . <p> She said locals were very concerned that the government 's preferred solution would " unnecessarily endanger the lives of school children " - there are two schools near the crossing - by forcing east traffic on Buckley Street to use narrow " rat runs " to pick up and drop off kids . <p> " We feel we are being forced to accept a substandard solution purely to fulfil on the current government 's election promise , " Ms Shaw said . <p> Level Crossing Removal Authority project director Michael ? ? ? said the line was the best way to remove the level crossing . <p> " Buckley Street is one of Melbourne 's worst level crossings , with the boom gates down for a staggering 78 minutes in the two-hour morning peak , " he said . 
 <p> AFTER almost three years of court proceedings , the family and friends of Raywood murder victim David Paris have had their chance to tell his killer of the pain of the crime . <p> Maxwell Pain , 55 , appeared at a plea hearing in the Melbourne Supreme Court on Tuesday after he was found guilty of the 2014 murder of Mr Paris , 36 . <p> Pain was captured on his own CCTV leaving his property with two guns before driving to Raywood where he shot Mr Paris in the stomach from the window of his ute , falsely accusing him of having an affair with his wife . <p> In a victim impact statement the fiancee of Mr Paris , Rebecca Lambert , told the court it would take " all the paper in this world " to describe her loss . <p> " Dave saved my life , " she said . <p> " If it was n't for Dave , I would n't be here today to tell you how amazing he was to me . <p> " I have no idea why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was harmless and never did no wrong . <p> " It feels like a lifetime sentence of pain . " <p> His mother , Deborah Paris , told the court Mr Paris was her " first consideration in every choice I made in life from the age of 17 " . <p> " For 19 years we only had each other and that created a bond that very few people , unless they have experienced it , can appreciate , " she said . <p> " We shared every situation . It was David who provided the love and support through ten years of cancer , getting a bucket and putting a cold flannel on my forehead for hours for bouts of chemo . <p> " When I bought my first house , we both slated the floors , oiled the cedar exterior , developed a garden and did everything else involved in establishing and maintaining a home . " <p> Pain pleaded not guilty to the murder and was found guilty by a jury after four days of deliberation . <p> A psychologist 's report tendered to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris ' mother-in-law , suffered a " range of delusions about his ex-wife 's extramarital fidelity " <p> His defence counsel , John Desmond , said Pain would meet the criteria for " delusional disorder , multiple episodes " as outlined in the report . <p> Mr Desmond said it reduced Pain 's moral culpability . <p> " If you 've got the diagnosis and he 's untreated , then he 's not in the same category of the bloke who just believes mistakenly that his wife is having an affair and goes out and shoots someone , " he said . <p> " He 's not that person because he 's got the delusional disorder . " <p> The court heard Pain has a history of alcohol abuse and is suffering " diabetes complications " in one leg . His ex-wife Tracey Bush -- present on the night of the murder -- told the court the accusations of infidelity started several months after they married . <p> Mr Desmond said he would be asking the court for a baseline sentence of 15 years ' jail . <p> Pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder on June 10 , 2014 . <p> Justice Michael Croucher said the continuing legal proceedings were a burden for Mr Paris ' family . <p> " A mother has lost her only son , " he said . <p> " A boy has lost his father . <p> " A partner has lost her life partner , a grandmother has lost her grandson and every other relationship you can think of .

 <h> Coates Hire workers in danger of ' devastating ' pay cut <p> Hundreds of workers at Australia 's largest equipment-hire business face a pay cut of up to 40 per cent unless they agree to let the company slash new employees ' wages and conditions . <p> Hundreds of workers at Australia 's largest equipment-hire business face a pay cut of up to 40 per cent unless they agree to let the company slash new employees ' wages and conditions . <p> Fairfax Media has obtained a copy of a presentation being shown to 900 staff at Coates Hire this week , in which management warns it will consider tearing up the existing pay deal altogether if employees turn down its " best and final offer " . <p> Coates Hire is the latest major Australian employer to flag the option of applying for the Fair Work Commission to terminate an agreement - a tactic that , if successful , reverts workers back to the minimum wages contained in awards . <p> But the offer , which comes after a two-year pay freeze , includes the introduction of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent less pay , one week less in annual leave and reduced penalty rates , according to the union . <p> Workers who have spoken to Fairfax Media said falling back onto the pay rates set out in the award would have a devastating financial impact on them . <p> " You 've got guys with families and kids and mortgages , who just would n't be able to make ends meet , " said one worker , who did not want to be named . <p> " Managers are telling us if we vote no they 'll tear up the agreement ... a lot of us do n't necessarily understand the process . It 's a real scare tactic . " <p> In a question-and-answer sheet , which was pinned up in Coates Hire lunch rooms on Tuesday , management rejected union accusations that it was making " threats " . <p> A company spokesman on Tuesday said Coates Hire had been indicating to employees for some time that applying for the Fair Work Commission to terminate the agreement was " legally available " if the new deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means a threat , " the spokesman said . " It 's simply a statement of the next possible steps . " <p> The spokesman said Coates Hire had been " very accommodating " of its workers ' industrial requests for several years . Over the past four years , he said , the company had awarded minimum wage increases of 18 per cent . <p> Coates Hire operates around Australia , as well as in Indonesia and the United Kingdom . It is co-owned by investment firm Seven Group Holdings and private equity group Carlyle Group . <p> The equipment-hire business had been exposed to the resources downturn and had suffered considerable losses and accumulated a sizeable debt , the spokesman said . And , although it recently posted a $15 million half-yearly profit , it was still not enough for a company of its size to " reinvest or grow the business " . <p> " While we are improving the business performance , " he said , " we are not in a position to accommodate all union claims in this enterprise agreement negotiation . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's latest offer on Thursday and Friday . <p> Stephen Smith , the head of workplace relations with the Australian Industry Group , said more than 300 applications were made to the Fair Work Commission to terminate agreements last financial year , " so there is nothing particularly unusual about the process " . <p> " In most cases , " he said , " employers and employees covered by an enterprise agreement negotiate a replacement agreement , rather than applying to terminate the previous agreement . " <p> " However , where agreement has not been reached on a replacement agreement , any of the parties are able to apply to the Fair Work Commission to terminate the old agreement . " 
 <h> Editorial : Why domestic violence is our community 's most urgent issue <p> From celebrity interviews to the September 11 terrorist atrocities , Martin has always been poised , professional and probing in more than 50 years on our screens . <p> He struck a chord last year in his special on the ice epidemic in regional Australia but few causes have been as deeply personal as the project that most recently brought him to this part of the world . <p> Speaking with Rosie Batty as part of an upcoming Prime7 documentary , Dark Secrets : Australia 's Hidden Shame , Martin laid bare his soul to reveal his own dark secret -- a childhood scarred by domestic violence . <p> Born Raymond George Grace , his mother was forced to change the family 's surname as they fled from her abusive , alcoholic husband . <p> How the horrors of family violence shaped a young Martin 's mind is hard to know . <p> Even decades on , it is clearly still a painful story for him to recount . <p> But it 's important he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because memories of domestic violence should not be confined to the cloistered corners of people 's minds . <p> And victims should not feel a sense of shame .

 <h> Hip hip hoo Yea <p> The bank manager laughed when Christopher Curry and partner Jacqui Kirby applied for a home loan . <p> The bank manager laughed when Christopher Curry and his partner Jacqui Kirby applied for a home loan . Based on what Christopher earned they had no hope , he said . <p> The frustrated young couple were left wondering how they would ever buy a family home . <p> But past humiliations were forgotten on Friday when the pair were officially handed the keys to a three-bedroom home in the picturesque town of Yea , north-east of Melbourne . <p> And it was built using " sweat equity " , where low-income families agree to put in voluntary labour in return for a low-interest mortgage and capped repayments . <p> To qualify for their $260,000 home loan , which had a small deposit and is interest-free for 10 years , Christopher and Jacqui - with help from friends and family - painted walls , sanded and landscaped the garden with natives . <p> The Yea affordable housing project - 25 houses - is a project from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the largest providers of affordable and low-cost housing worldwide . <p> Established in the 1980s , the Victorian organisation has helped more than 50 families gain what they refer to as the " empowerment " of home ownership . <p> The Yea houses are the biggest project to date , and Habitat 's homes have mainly been built on the fringes of Melbourne because there is better access to affordable land , says Habitat business development manager Phillip Wright . <p> " We aim to build decent affordable housing for low-income families , predominantly . We provide a house people will be proud to live in , not different to the others around them . " <p> Having families contribute some of their equity in the form of labour makes them feel more invested in the project , says Wright . <p> " Sometimes people in these situations get a bit run down with Centrelink and other agencies , so having a hands-on role can be empowering , " he says . <p> A band of volunteers also donate their labour to paint and clad the homes , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million dollars funding for the Yea project came from the Lord Mayors Charitable Foundation . <p> Most of the homes will be purchased by families on an income below $50,000 per annum - who go through a screening process - and are likely to be recipients of unemployment or disability payments , said the foundation 's chief executive , Catherine Brown . <p> " Having secure housing ... is likely to lead to better educational and employment outcomes and to stronger social networks , " she said . <p> Given the scale of Victoria 's affordable housing crisis - there are 34,000 people waiting for social housing - 25 homes might seem like a drop in the ocean . <p> But Phillips says their research shows it has a markedly positive effect on each family . <p> " All you have to experience is one house handover to realise it 's such a deeply significant change to have made to one family .

 <h> More than 110,000 fines issued to motorists using a mobile phone in three years <p> Darren May 2017 , 10:11 a.m . <p> Victorian motorists have been hit with almost 113,000 fines for using a mobile phone while driving in Victoria in the past three years , clocking up more than $40 million in fines . <p> Risk-taking motorists have been hit with almost 113,000 fines for using a mobile phone while driving in Victoria in the past three years , clocking up more than $40 million in fines . <p> But senior police warn the number of fines issued is indicative of a larger , dangerous and sometimes fatal problem . <p> " Whilst this is significant enforcement , to me , unfortunately , I think it 's a drop in the ocean of what 's actually going on there . You , me and your readers , see this every single day , " said Victoria 's top traffic cop , Doug Fryer . <p> Seen in Melbourne 's CBD in recent days . Photo : Jason South <p> And he warned that society 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distracted by mobile phones contributed to the road toll . <p> " We know that mobile phones were involved in fatalities last year , and already this year we have a number of cases where we know that mobile phone use has been partially responsible for road deaths , " he said . <p> Police were in discussion with State Coroner Sara Hinchey about examining the relationship between road deaths and mobile phone use . <p> Sixty per cent of Victorian motorists in a recent survey said they use their mobile phone while driving , Mr Fryer said . <p> The fines issued for mobile phone use over the past three financial years included 107,964 for using a hand-held mobile phone while driving , which incurs a $466 fine and four demerit points . <p> A further 5015 fines were issued to learner and probationary drivers caught using a mobile phone . It is illegal in Victoria for younger drivers to use even a hands-free mobile phone while driving . <p> Mr Fryer said the style of offending had changed in recent years with many motorists now using social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offending a couple of years ago by holding the phone to their ear , at least they were still looking straight ahead . Now the style of offending has changed , they 're looking in their lap , they 're not even having any of their eyes on the road . So it is far more dangerous now than it 's ever been , " said Mr Fryer , Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner for road policing command . <p> He said it was " acceptable " for full-licence holders to use a hands-free , Bluetooth-enabled mobile phone Bluetooth while driving . <p> " We 're encouraging everyone to put the phone out of reach , out of sight , out of mind . It will still ring and you can pick it up on Bluetooth . But we do n't want people touching their phone because it is having fatal consequences , " he said . <p> Joe Calafiore , CEO of the TAC , said using a mobile phone while driving increased a motorist 's risk of " crashing , being injured or worse . Unless you are totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respond when something unexpected happens . If you look down at your phone for two seconds while driving at 100km/h , you will travel more than 55 meters blind . " <p> Road Safety Minister Luke Donnellan expressed frustration that motorists " continue to put their lives and the lives of others at risk . We want everyone to stop using their phones when driving , getting home safe is more important than a text message . <p> " You are four times more likely to have a serious crash resulting in hospitalisation if you drive and use your mobile . " <p> Kristie Young , research fellow at the Monash University Accident Research Centre , said using a mobile phone while driving was " very dangerous " . <p> Talking on a mobile phone increased a motorist 's reaction time by about 50 per cent . " And when drivers are texting their reaction time doubles , " she said . <p> " We find that drivers , when they 're talking on a phone , they tend to stare straight ahead . So it affects their scanning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that means that they either miss the hazard or they react to them quite late , " she said . 
 <h> Why John Laws is good for entertainment value <p> Ageing gracefully - let alone quietly - was never something John Laws was going to embrace with gusto . <p> The 81-year-old has already said his initial attempt to retire from the airwaves in 2007 was one of his greatest regrets . He lasted three years . <p> Now , back - with a much smaller audience but still with his golden microphone - Laws has been on the publicity trail to flog a memoir on his 60 years in radio . <p> Though we can only wonder if " Lawsie " realises it is 2017 and not 1967 . While there were howls of protest when Laws offered his arcane views of women , specifically why he prefers they wear short skirts to show off their legs in his office and that he enjoys their company more than men because " they talk more " , for anyone who has been listening to Laws for a while , this is hardly revelatory . <p> Far from being " sexist " , Laws is simply a relic from another era @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A radio dinosaur who is acutely aware of his own reflection when it comes to admiring beauty . That 's part of the joke : the ageing lothario " trying it on " with a nubile creature old enough to be his granddaughter . Laws is , in equal parts , flattering and creepy . <p> Let there be no doubt the radio star truly believed that what he was saying about women was actually complimentary , rather than demeaning in any way . <p> High-profile women , from feminist trailblazer Ita Buttrose to broadcast survivor Jessica Rowe , have both leapt to his defence in recent days , assuring their audiences that the Laws they know is far from a chauvinist . <p> Indeed , quite the opposite is true , Laws loves women , it 's just the way he expresses it is no longer considered kosher . <p> You see on Planet Laws , the world operates somewhat differently . It is a world that time has forgotten . A place of 1980s-style luxury , where the town car is a Rolls-Royce and a butler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new-fangled gadgets as a dishwasher . <p> He calls his wife Caroline " Princess " , and says it endearingly so . Indeed it is the " Princess " who rules on Planet Laws . <p> But let 's not forget , Laws still sees himself as the poet who penned some of the best-selling books of poetry written in Australia , books devoted to romance and love , poems he recorded on vinyl , his dulcet tones dripping like honey . <p> And while Bob Ellis once described Laws as " the worst poet in the whole history of the entire universe " , Laws ' poetry books sold 25,000 copies each , which considering some of Australia 's foremost poets are lucky to sell 1000 copies certainly puts their popularity into perspective . <p> Indeed there was a time when Laws ranked as one of the great Australian heart throbs . He appeared opposite Googie Withers in a bizarre film in 1971 called Nickel Queen in which he played a dope-smoking , , long-haired , free-lovin ' hippie guru . <p> Surely Laws should be commended for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political correctness and beige civility . <p> One of the great lunchers of Sydney , PS remembers fondly in 2007 when Laws abruptly left his table at Woolloomooloo 's Otto restaurant and marched up to where long-time rivals Bob Rogers and Derryn Hinch were dining and called them " despicable c ... s " . 
 <p> State and federal Nationals MPs visited the Bendigo Airport last week as the project approaches completion . Picture : ADAM HOLMES <p> Flying day-old chicks out of Bendigo Airport is one of a number of revenue streams being explored by the City of Greater Bendigo as it looks to reduce the financial impost of the city 's airport . <p> And while council has yet to formalise a commercial carrier for airport , Bendigo Airport Advisory Committee Chair , councillor James Williams , said it would be a " fair expectation " to have regional operators flying out of the city by the end of 2018 . <p> " We have to demonstrate that there are long-term benefits for them ( carriers ) . It 's not a cheap operation to set up in a regional airport , " Cr Williams said . <p> Anecdotally , the City of Greater Bendigo has financially supported the airport to the tune of $200,000 , or the historical equivalent , per year since the 1980s . <p> Emergency services regularly use the airport but , according to the Bendigo Airport Strategic Plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to match its operating expenditure . " <p> Cr Williams said while the city was happy to provide some dollars to the project , " we do n't want it to be a financial burden going into the future " . <p> " What we do n't want to see is having invested $15 million dollars is the airport just sitting there , " he said . <p> The Bendigo airport prior to it 's runway upgrade . <p> The City of Greater Bendigo will officially open the project this week , which included a new 1600-metre runway and the capacity to host four large commercial planes on the tarmac at one time . <p> Federal , state and local government money has supported the project . <p> As it works on locking in a commercial carrier , the city will approach larger businesses -- like earth moving companies , engineering groups and livestock exporters -- to use the airport . <p> In addition to flying out day-old chicks , exporting chicken eggs to be used for emergency flu vaccines overseas was another realistic option , Cr Williams said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tier six airport , to a tier two -- non capital city international gateway airports like Coolangatta -- or tier three -- major regional airports with direct interstate services like Alice Springs -- as classified by the National Aviation Infrastructure Network . <p> That process could take " a couple of years " , according to Cr Williams , who said it would n't be without its challenges . <p> " It 's a fallacy that Bendigo Airport would be competing with Tullamarine . That airspace is becoming increasingly crowded , " he said .

 <h> Bloods prove they are back among top tier of the BFNL with win over Sandhurst <p> IF it had n't already done so with its 4-1 start to the season , South Bendigo has now officially announced itself as back among the top bracket of the BFNL . <p> CLEARING KICK : South Bendigo 's Isaiah Miller gets boot to ball under pressure from Sandhurst 's Galen Munari at the Queen Elizabeth Oval on Saturday . The Bloods were 30-point winners to improve to 5-1 . Picture : DARREN HOWE <p> While the previous week 's two-point win over Kyneton was full of merit , there 's no bigger statement to make in Bendigo football then by knocking off the reigning premiers on the QEO . <p> That 's what the Bloods did on Saturday in what could prove the coming-of-age win of this group as they outclassed and outworked Sandhurst by 30 points . <p> In front of a large contingent of former players as the Bloods regained the coveted Graeme Wright Memorial Cup for the first time since 2013 , South Bendigo won 13.18 ( 96 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150th game . <p> Highlighting the advancements made by the Bloods this year , Saturday 's victory ended a string of seven losses in a row against the Dragons by an average of 70 points . <p> One of the big questions heading into the game was how would the Bloods handle the absence of star forward Kaiden Antonowicz ? <p> The answer was with coach Brady Childs providing the key avenue to goal . <p> By the two-minute mark of the second term Childs , playing deep forward , already had three goals before he ended the match with five and as one of the most influential players . <p> The Bloods ' win was built on a combination of intense pressure on the Dragons that never let-up , with their tackle count hitting 89 , and quick sling-shot movement from the back half . <p> The Bloods had been slow out of the blocks when inside the first six minutes the Dragons slammed on three goals to Seb Greene , Joel Wharton and Jon Coghlan , his after three bounces , before South had gone inside its 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when Childs put the Bloods up by four points two minutes into the second term , they would n't surrender the lead for the rest of the match . <p> Telling in the Bloods ' win was their ability to hit the scoreboard against the wind at the Barnard Street end , in particular the pivotal third quarter when they outscored the Dragons 4.5 to 2.6 . <p> That put the Bloods up by 18 points at three quarter-time , before they squandered the chance to really put the Dragons to the sword in the final term by kicking 2.8 to Sandhurst 's 1.2 . <p> Ruckman Kieran Strachan again played a ripper game for the Bloods to be their best player , while midfielder Liam Bartels , Childs and Connaughton , who was a workhorse as usual , were among South Bendigo 's best . <p> The Dragons named defenders Josh Hann and Liam Ireland their two best players . 
 <p> BENDIGO Lady Braves coach Jonathan Goodman has lamented his side 's inability to put four good quarters of defence together following a road loss to the Kilsyth Cobras . <p> TOP GAME : Guard Bianca drew praise from Kilsyth coach Sam Woosnam for a stirring effort for the Bendigo Lady Braves in Sunday 's game at Kilsyth . <p> The Lady Braves dropped to 8-4 after being stung by the Cobras 76-66 on Sunday afternoon at the Kilsyth Sports Centre . <p> Goodman said the Lady Braves had plenty of chances to win the game , but were made to pay for an ordinary final quarter in which they surrendered 30 points , despite holding the Cobras to 46 points in the opening three terms . <p> " We got 10 offensive boards in the first quarter , played well in the second and late in the third , but then unfortunately we did n't come out with any effort in the fourth and gave up 30 , " she said . <p> " Kilsyth are a really quality group and were missing one of their big insiders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't . <p> " Our starts are killing us . This group needs to understand that they need to play defence for four quarters to win a game . " <p> The Lady Braves were always on the back foot after being nine points down at quarter time , before working back into the contest by outscoring the home side 32-25 in the middle two quarters . <p> Former Bendigo Spirit star Maddie Garrick inflicted the most damage on the Lady Braves and finished with 23 points and seven rebounds . <p> Import post-player Angela Beadle had 12 rebounds to complement her 16 points , while another former Spirit player Chantelle Perera had 13 points . <p> For the Lady Braves , import Ashley Rininger top-scored with 17 points and hauled in nine rebounds , while guard Bianca Dufelmeir impressed with 14 points and three assists . <p> Chloe Bibby finished with 15 points and five rebounds , while Chante Black had 12 points and 10 rebounds . <p> The Lady Braves were without Carlie Smith , who was rested as a precaution with a knee complaint . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter was every bit as instrumental in the win than its impressive fourth quarter showing . <p> " It was always going to be hard for them playing catch-up basketball , " she said . <p> " They made a run back at us and they played zone ( defence ) for 40 minutes which does n't help us at all . <p> " They did a good job to get back into it in the second half , but we were lucky enough to grind it out and hold on . " <p> Former WNBL legend Woosnam rated Dufelmeir as the Lady Braves ' best on Sunday .

 <p> Matthew Smith , founder the campaign group Fortify Rights , called on Myanmar authorities to immediately investigate the footage to determine the well-being and whereabouts of the detained men and prosecute the soldiers . <p> Details on when and where the violence took place are murky but Mr Smith believes it happened recently . <p> " This is one of the rare cases where we can see the soldiers committing torture in conflict zones , " he said . <p> Reuters reported the victims were being questioned as to whether they belonged to the Taang National Liberation Army , an ethnic armed group based in Myanmar 's eastern Shan State . <p> Myanmar authorities have not commented . <p> Earlier this year a selfie-style video taken by a police border guard in Myanmar 's western Rakhine State showed the kicking and beating of Rohingya Muslims , sparking outrage . <p> In January 2016 another video showed Burmese soldiers being brutally punched and kicked by senior officers in an army barracks . <p> Rights groups accuse Myanmar 's military of continuing to commit gross human rights abuses in border areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the election of Aung San Suu Kyi 's National League for Democracy in 2015 . <p> Under an army-written constitution the military retains a quarter of all seats in Parliament and controls the country 's key security ministries . <p> Ms Suu Kyi , a Nobel Peace laureate , has been unable or unwilling to confront the military over atrocities in Rakhine that the UN says could amount to ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity . <p> Her government has not commented on the latest video . <p> Fifty-nine Myanmar-based civil society organisations have called on the government to cooperate with a UN inquiry into the violence that broke out after police border posts were attacked in October last year , <p> The military and government have denied atrocities have happened despite the UN documenting eye-witness accounts and more than 80,000 Rohingya fleeing the state to squalid Bangladesh border camps . <p> After a year in power , Ms Suu Kyi hosted a new round of peace talks between the military , ethnic groups , elected officials and observers from civil society groups , in the capital Naypyitaw last week . 
 <p> 'S Matt has again proven a major thorn in the side of Kyneton with another match-winning bag of goals . <p> Star forward put an end to Kyneton 's season with a nine-goal haul in last year 's elimination final . <p> And on Saturday he kicked another nine as the Hawks kept intact an unbeaten run of Canterbury Park wins against the Tigers that stretches back to 2003 with a seven-point victory in a round seven shootout . <p> The Hawks prevailed 18.11 ( 119 ) to 17.10 ( 112 ) , their first score over 100 for the season , to improve their BFNL record to 5-2 . <p> Such is the tightness of the competition among the top six teams , Saturday 's loss saw the Tigers fall from third to sixth on the ladder . <p> As well as Gretgrix 's bag , down the other end Kyneton 's Ben Weightman was also lively with a haul of seven goals , which included three in the first term . <p> wasted no time making his mark on the contest . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three goals . <p> The veteran added another two in the second quarter , two in the third and two in the last . <p> He had booted seven goals before his first miss , while late in the game he squandered a golden opportunity to kick his 10th when he sprayed a 20m set-shot to the right . <p> In what was a free-flowing contest , the Tigers led by 17 points during the second quarter -- 9.6 to 7.1 -- as they brought plenty of heat to the contest , forcing the Hawks to turn the ball over and winning the crucial midfield battle . <p> The Tigers ' tackle pressure was exemplified in one three-minute patch when they were awarded three holding the ball free kicks . <p> What was telling , though , for the Hawks was their conversion in front of goal that kept them within striking distance . <p> After Gretgrix kicked the last two goals of the second quarter , the Hawks went into half-time with 9.1 on the board and only trailing the Tigers ' 9.7 by six points . <p> Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawks , with coach Josh Bowe leading the charge , continued to press in the third quarter in what became the telling period of the game when they added 5.6 to 3.1 to build an 11-point lead at the last change . <p> Highlighting the vigour of the Hawks in the third term was the desperate effort of Brenton Conforti , who played well across half-forward , to sprint to force a spoil and then win a free kick . <p> The Hawks ' advantage grew to a game high 24 points during the last quarter when Cameron McGlashan kicked his second goal . <p> But the Tigers fought on with the last three goals of the game -- two of which were long-range set-shots to Patrick McCarthy , who had started the day on , and Nick Brazil -- to cut the final deficit to seven points as for the second time in three games they were beaten having kicked a score of more than 100. 
 <h> Bulls sneak past Magpies by three points in NCFL thriller <p> put the disappointment of a one-point loss behind it the previous week to sneak over the line against Boort in another North Central league thriller on Saturday . <p> The Bulls brought an end to Boort 's five-game winning streak with a hard-fought 7.14 ( 56 ) to 8.5 ( 53 ) win . <p> The Bulls ' gripping win followed a one-point loss to Donald a week earlier , while the Magpies have now been involved in three games in a row decided by single-figure margins , having won their previous two by just four and seven points . <p> Had the Bulls been beaten they would have only had themselves to blame due to their inaccurate kicking , with the result one of the rare games where the losing team kicked more goals than the winners . <p> The Bulls ' 7.14 included a wasteful 2.8 in the second quarter . <p> Charlie Hallam , Lachlan Foott and Nathan Gordon ( two goals ) played well for the Bulls . <p> 's Richard Tibbett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Magpies ' better players led by Kyle Manley , Ben Gregg ( two goals ) and Jack Smith . <p> * Charlton pulled off an upset to win its second game at the expense of Sea Lake Tigers . <p> The Navies only kicked two goals in the second half , but they had done the damage in the first when they led by 33 points , 10.3 to 4.6 . <p> The Tigers lifted in the second half , but the Navies won 12.7 ( 79 ) to 8.13 ( 61 ) . <p> The influence of lively forward Matt Giri was telling in the result as he kicked six of the Navies ' 12 goals , while coach Aaron Walklate played a fine leader 's game , with Mark Vigus ( two goals ) and Josh McKee ( two goals ) also key contributors for the reigning premiers . <p> The Tigers -- who are yet to beat the Navies in three meetings since joining the NCFL -- had good players in Ryan O'Sullivan , who has been in their best in every game , Luke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest win in the North Central league since 2015 , thrashing Wedderburn by 142 points . <p> Fired up after their first loss of the season to Boort the previous week , the Demons put the Redbacks to the sword with their 27.20 ( 182 ) to 5.10 ( 40 ) hiding . <p> Demons ' star Corey Jones outscored the Redbacks on his own with a haul of nine goals to be one of 11 goalkickers , six of whom slotted multiples . <p> The Demons kicked six goals in the first quarter , six in the second , seven in the third and eight in the last . <p> The Redbacks , who have now lost seven in a row against the Demons , did n't score in the last quarter . <p> * Donald joined and Sea Lake Tigers with 4-3 records with its 12-point victory over St Arnaud . <p> The Royals opened a 15-point lead at quarter-time and from there were able to hold the Saints at bay to record a 9.13 ( 67 ) to 7.13 ( 55 ) win at St @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the success of the Royals , who named Darcy Harrison and Joshua Potter their best . <p> Daniel Hargraves ( four goals ) was one of the standouts for the Saints , along with Nicholas Baldwin . <p> With all teams having played each other once , the NCFL ladder highlights the swings and roundabouts of country football , with the bottom three teams -- Charlton , Wedderburn and St Arnaud -- having won the past three premierships.

 <p> The three attackers had driven onto the bridge at high-speed , mowing down pedestrians before getting out of the vehicle and stabbing people at nearby bars and restaurants . <p> It was a Saturday night and the streets were filled with patrons who reportedly threw chairs , bottles and glasses at the attackers as they used knives to slash their way through crowds . <p> The suspects were shot dead by police . <p> Before the attack , Mrs Lowe had planned to visit the bridge on her last day in London . <p> She said she would still make the trip to the site , but instead to lay flowers and pay respect to those who had been affected by the tragedy . <p> " I want to keep coming and supporting London , " she said . <p> " One act of horror can sort of redefine what people remember a place for , but you just have to keep going to those places and showing them support .

 <p> Teachers and union representatives took their indignation at the federal government 's proposed model of education funding to the office of Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie yesterday , calling on the MP to stand up for Bendigo schools they say the deal will hurt . <p> Kangaroo Flat Primary School teacher Alastair Para was one of 10 people to gather outside the Hargreaves Street electoral office and said needs-based funding awarded to his school under the existing model benefited disadvantaged students . <p> Under the model put forward by the government , Australian schools will receive $22 billion less than if the Labor party 's policy was upheld , money Mr Para said funded speech pathologists , occupational therapists and education support staff he credited with improved levels of student literary and numeracy . <p> " Without that money , we 're going to have to make some decisions about what we prioritise , " he said . <p> Mr Para believed the government was trying to improve the budget 's bottom line but said savings should not come at the expense of children with special learning needs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday , saying her government 's education policy was widely supported , even winning approval from David Gonski , the architect of the current funding model . <p> " Our proposal seeks to ensure that students and schools with the same need attract the same support from the Commonwealth , regardless of where they live or which state they live in , " Ms McKenzie said . <p> She also responded to criticism from the Sandhurst division of the Catholic Education Office following a no-show at a St Liborius school forum this week . Chief executive Paul Desmond raised concerns about the absence and about a now-retracted tweet from Ms McKenzie that appeared to disparage the Catholic education system . <p> " I am firmly of the view that parents have the right to education their children in whatever school they choose , be it faith based , independent or in the public system , " the MP said . 
 <h> Elwood family seeks injunction to remove overhanging crane <p> An Elwood family has gone to the Supreme Court to force an apartment developer to take down a six-storey crane that is swinging in the breeze over their backyard . <p> The couple , who have two small children , say the crane is in their airspace and that fear of an accident may force them to move out of their home . <p> The crane was erected by developer Steller , despite the couple 's objections , as part of a 28-apartment development in a four-level project on Ormond Road . <p> The tower crane , commonly known in the construction industry as a " hammerhead " crane , is not necessary for construction . Rather it is being used to expedite the project . <p> Neighbours Haydn Janney and wife Suzanne Foti this week filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court saying they feared for the safety of their children , aged six and seven . <p> They say the crane has already dropped oil on their property - resulting in the company providing a $300 gift to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plastic and foam rubber have also fallen off the crane into their backyard . <p> A hearing began on Wednesday before Justice Peter Riordan . <p> In excerpts of emails included in the affidavit , Steller admits it could have avoided using a tower crane - but says construction would take longer . <p> " Whilst I agree that the build can be done without the use of a tower crane , the alternative will add an additional three months to the build time and significant interruption to the traffic within the area due to road closure and mobile crane use , " Steller 's construction director said in an email to the homeowners . <p> Moving the crane would cost Steller tens of thousands of dollars , and delay construction of the apartments . <p> Mr Janney , who works in education , said his research had uncovered many accidents in similar circumstances , and that he was " not prepared to take the risk given my two young children " . <p> Builders must leave cranes swinging freely when not in operation so wind gusts do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crane regularly swings over the couple 's home , and neighbouring apartments . <p> The couple asked the company to relocate them while the crane is used but they said Steller 's construction director told them they " would not entertain relocating our family and did not offer any alternatives " . <p> A lawyer for the couple wrote to Steller in May to tell them a crane above their home would be a trespass . Steller erected its crane the day after the letter was sent . <p> Since then , " the crane had been overhanging where my children play and sleep many times . Given the significant stress and fear we are experiencing , my family and I are unable to use our property , " Mr Janney wrote . <p> The Age contacted Steller manager director Nicholas Smedley via phone and text message on Wednesday but he did not respond . His public relations agency and barrister Samuel Horgan also declined to discuss the matter . <p> In court , Mr Horgan said Steller needed more time to understand the concern over the crane . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried above the property , " he said . <p> The case " raises some interesting issues " , Justice Riordan told barrister Andrew Woods , who is acting for the the Elwood couple . But Justice Riordan also granted Steller 's lawyers more time to prepare their response . <p> Mr Woods told the court that there was no argument the crane was his clients ' property , or that his clients had warned the developer not to erect the crane . " The willfulness of it is entirely clear , " he said . <p> Justice Riordan said it would be far better if the disagreement could be settled outside the courts . " By the time we had a trial on this matter we could probably build a new crane , " he said . 
 <p> The Victorian government will offer businesses a cash incentive to hire Murray Goulburn workers retrenched during the company 's recent round of cuts , a move welcomed by families facing financial uncertainty . <p> A spokesman for Victorian treasurer Tim Pallas yesterday confirmed workplaces that employed staff laid off from the milk giant 's Rochester and Kiewa factories would be eligible for payments of up to $5000 . <p> The back to work scheme was announced in May last year and will continue until next June , unless the allocated $5 million runs out . <p> Payments of $5000 will be awarded for each full-time , ongoing job given to an embattled dairy industry worker , while ongoing , part-time offers of work will reap a $3750 benefit for the employer . <p> " It shows the government will always stand behind our rural communities , and we wo n't let any farmer or community member go it alone , " Mr Pallas said . <p> The Bendigo Advertiser understands Murray Goulburn employees have been given a tentative end date , with the first wave of lay-offs expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be confirmed until six weeks ' prior to an employee 's last day . <p> All production will cease in Rochester by mid-February , less than year after the processor announced the closure of three factories . <p> The spouses of two Murray Goulburn employees , both of whom asked to remain anonymous , said a lack of certainty about when they would finish at the Rochester site made planning for their family 's future difficult . <p> " ( There 's ) still too many questions and not enough answers , " one said . <p> An inability to start work immediately made their spouses unattractive to potential bosses , she believed . <p> But both agreed the government 's Back to Work scheme could convince workplaces to employ their partners . <p> ? A spokesman for Murray Goulburn said the company was providing " appropriate " employment supports to its retrenched workers . <p> " This included advice regarding expected individual last days of work , opportunities for redeployment at other MG sites , outplacement services and potential entitlements , " the spokesman said . <p> " MG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our stakeholders , including the communities in which we operate .

 <p> The 85-per-cent yes-vote , for a three-year deal with an average pay rise of 2 per cent per year , will be encouraging to other public service bosses around Canberra who are holding workplace votes this month . <p> The giant Defence Department will begin voting on Thursday for the fourth time on a proposed enterprise agreement and about 4000 Agriculture public servants are currently voting in an unprecedented fifth ballot . <p> Bosses at several departments have backed off the harsher elements of the Coalition 's controversial public sector bargaining policy in an effort to finally settle the industrial disputes that have wracked government workplaces for three years . <p> With union no-vote activity at both agencies way down on previous efforts , hopes are high that workforces will finally accept the deals that have been offered . <p> Murray-Darling Basin Authority Chief Executive Phillip Glyde ? ? ? told his workers on Tuesday that the turn-out for the industrial ballot had been " fantastic " . <p> " We had 264 staff vote , from the 292 staff who were eligible to vote , " Mr Glyde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of over 90 per cent . <p> " There were 224 staff that voted yes , and 40 staff that voted no . <p> " This is an 85 per cent yes vote . <p> " I am pleased to declare we have a yes vote ! ! " <p> Mr Glyde conceded that the bargaining process had been " long and difficult " . <p> " It 's been a long and difficult road and I 'm pleased we now have an EA that the vast majority of our staff are comfortable with , " he wrote . <p> The agreement must now be lodged with the Fair Work Commission , and it may be three weeks before the commission 's process for approving the deal is complete . <p> Mr Glyde promised his workers , who have not had a general pay rise since 2013 , that their wage increases would begin to be paid in the first pay cycle after FWC approval . 
 <p> CONTROVERSY surrounding plans to build a mosque in Bendigo has resulted in greater intercultural understanding , a study has found . But issues remain . <p> The Social Cohesion in Bendigo report , compiled by La Trobe University for the Victorian Multicultural Commission , was created in response to the protests surrounding the development . <p> Researchers observed that the nature of the protests differed from other " contentious planning scenarios " because they targeted a particular group of people in society , rather than the development itself . <p> " They aimed to exclude Muslim people from experiencing the same rights and freedoms as others in Australian society to practice their faith , " the study stated . <p> That animosity divided the community , the researchers wrote . <p> " The Bendigo mosque development opened up space for vibrant debates on the politics of diversity , especially around notions of democracy , leadership , social networks and information sharing , " they stated . <p> Story continues below post <p> The study highlighted the importance of strong and authoritative leadership to " facilitate healing within the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> It also highlighted the role of social interaction , " as a means to educate and overcome division in the community . " <p> " Fostering inclusive events and social gatherings emerged as a means of positively engaging community members in intercultural conversations , " the report stated . <p> Despite what the researchers described as " negativity of relations during the time of the protests " , they concluded that greater intercultural understanding had emerged . <p> " Events also enabled people to gain a better understanding of how some people have to live their lives under pressures of discrimination and racism , " the report stated . <p> However , the researchers said it would be necessary to work with the Greater Bendigo community as the mosque was built , in light of community polarisation . <p> " This comprises the creation of new conversations so that people with different views can communicate respectfully and learn from each other , " the report stated . <p> " This will not be easy , and many will not want to participate due to their world view and the polarisation that has occurred . " 
 <h> Social norm of drinking flagged as an issue <p> The widespread social acceptance of drinking is one of the issues that has been highlighted during health workers ' efforts to collect community feedback on drug and alcohol use . <p> This week and next , Bendigo Community Health Services is holding a series of community consultations across the region in an effort to better understand residents ' experiences with drugs and alcohol . <p> Project worker Leah Wastell said while the process was still in the early stages , the team had found that drinking was a social norm in Australia , present in many facets of public life , including in media . <p> So far consultation sessions have been held in Bendigo , Castlemaine and Kyneton . <p> Ms Wastell said the feedback from the sessions would inform a new plan for services for the region , which would be developed over the next 12 months . <p> Liaising with service providers and collecting information from the wider public are also part of the consultation process for the new plan . <p> BCHS is still seeking participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedback and shape future services . <p> Consultations are still to be held in Maryborough and Wedderburn , June 22 ; Echuca , June 23 ; Charlton and Kerang , June 28 ; Swan Hill , June 29 ; and Mildura , June 30.

 <h> Editorial : Unfortunately , the times they are a changin ' <p> REVELATIONS over the weekend that fans attending some of Melbourne 's biggest sporting arenas might have to undergo full body scans as part of new counter-terrorism measures are a bitter pill to swallow . <p> But what really sets it apart from many other sports-mad cities , either at home or abroad , is that people attend these events in droves every year , without fail . <p> Victorians love their sport , and especially love watching it live . We are not a bunch of couch-potato consumers , like NRL fans to our north , who are content to watch on television while their teams play in empty stadiums . <p> Rather , Victorians want the full experience of going along to an event with tens of thousands of like-minded strangers and seeing the best of the best in action with their own eyes . <p> It is a sad reflection on the state of the world that we , here in Australia , even need to consider the possibility that terrorists might want to attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is when you consider what percentage of those who assemble at these aforementioned events are children . <p> But given what has transpired in Europe in recent months -- not to mention incidents such as the Martin Place and Brighton sieges here at home -- it must be addressed . <p> Unfortunately , there are people out there who want to inflict harm and incite hatred through the use of barbaric acts against innocent people . <p> In the aftermath of September 11 , 2001 all the focus was on stopping the large-scale sophisticated attacks . However , recent events show terrorism can be committed with the simplest of weapons . <p> Will the installation of full body scanners discourage sports-lovers from going along to the MCG on a Saturday afternoon to watch their team play ? Perhaps , but it should n't . The terror threat exists wherever in the world you are , be it getting a coffee in the Sydney CBD , attending a pop concert in Manchester or visiting a Parisian church . <p> If these body scanners are introduced , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small price to pay for improved safety ? 
 <h> Why ca n't cyclists stay within the lines ? <p> I see that VicRoads only say the bicycles should be ridden in their marked lanes , but there is no law stating they must . <p> My question is why then do we spend so much money painting these lanes for them when in fact they can ride where ever they like on the road ? <p> Surely if a bicycle is deemed to be a vehicle , they have to comply with all the other road rules and in particular the rule that states " keep to the left as far as practicable " that applies to all other vehicles should apply to them as well , or is this a double standard ? <p> Whilst I am at it , why are they allowed to have such bright flashing headlights ( which can be very distracting to oncoming vehicles ) and flashing taillights , which are illegal on other vehicles ? <h> Robert K Smallpage , Huntly <h> The continuing rise of one Pauline Hanson <p> The journalists , academics and the entrenched politicians can not comprehend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It happens because of Australia having a democracy . <p> What you , the news media , and our elected politicians are expected to do is represent the majority of people in a balanced manner , with fact . <p> You are failing to do this . <p> The people must bring down the two major political parties to a level of being forced to govern our country for the good of all Australians and not allow minority votes to hold power to the detriment of Australia . <h> Kevin Inglis , Kangaroo Flat <h> Elites behind our falling standards <p> I find it sad that people who claim to be well-educated and compassionate towards all people should stoop to taking a few words from a speech in order to disparage a person . <p> Rather than being involved in an informed and mature debate , they employ the politics of hate and envy to cloud their judgment and try to claim that person 's speech was something it was not . <p> We expect hate from our politicians because they fear someone who can take votes from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are envious of a person who is willing to broach subjects they themselves lack the courage to do . <p> Fearful of feeling the wrath of an elite group whose members came up with a theory that had not been proven to raise academic standards , had it forced into a system that was underfunded and lacked the resources to implement , and then deny any debate about its benefits . <p> To stifle debate regarding this theory they recruit politicians and the media to shout down anyone having the temerity to question the worth or otherwise of this theory . <p> Whilst it might make people feel warm and fuzzy on the inside , it will do nothing raise the standards this country needs to succeed in the world , and possibly be a reason why our standards have fallen . <p> We have heard a lot regarding fake news in recent times and there can be no doubting in people 's minds that this phenomenon exists after recent local and national examples . <p> When politicians and media take a few sentences from a person 's speech and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just denigrate a person who has a view that differs from this elite . <p> The class divide used to be created by those with wealth and power telling us ordinary folk only they knew what was good for us . <p> Now we have a class divide created by education where those who have a piece of paper or have turned study into a life-long career , believe only they have a right to decide what is good for us without any need for consultation or debate . 
 <h> Punish one-punch attacks <p> In the past 15 years , more than 100 Australian lives have been lost due to one punch attacks .

How many more grieving parents will forever have metaphorical holes in their hearts after losing their sons ? <p> It 's a joke , and the only way to reduce the number of attacks is to actually punish those responsible . <p> This soft , slap on the wrist approach from our justice system is pathetic , and it needs to change . <p> Recently , a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison was introduced for the perpetrators whose victims die from one-punch attacks . <p> However , a maximum sentence is almost never handed down , and to at least deliver some sort of justice , a minimum penalty must be introduced . <p> This is an opinion shared by legendary boxer Danny Green . <p> The former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stamp out this senseless violence , with some success . There 's only so much that he can do though . <p> Friends of these thugs can help prevent attacks from happening . Sometimes all it takes is being told to walk away to make you reconsider being violent . <p> Whilst a grown man should be able to control himself , apparently some ca n't and in their cases maybe they should n't be drinking , period . But they do . So , their friends , significant others , family members -- whomever they may be drinking with -- are partly responsible for calming these people down . <p> Some experts believe that rehabilitation is the way to go by forcing offenders to attend anger management classes and trying to teach them how to better deal with their anger . <p> While these initiatives are well and good when they work , this is n't justice for the families of victims . <p> When a mother loses a son , the one thing she would want more than anything else is to know that another mum does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the coward responsible behind bars . <p> If you punch somebody in the back of the head , you need to be made accountable for your actions . <p> In future , lace up some boxing gloves , find a sparring partner or a boxing bag and release that aggression in an appropriate setting . <p> Do n't kill somebody . Do n't ruin another family 's life . <p> Letting violent offenders walk on bail is getting us nowhere . <p> Personally , I 'd like to see these criminals be forced to throw down in a boxing ring with someone of the calibre of Danny Green , but I 'll settle for jail time . <p> A minimum sentence of five years ' imprisonment if the victim survives , 10 if they do n't . A coward 's punch is murder , there 's nothing accidental about it . <h> Nathan Wright , Kangaroo Flat <h> Hanson 's idea has merit <p> On the face of it , Pauline Hanson 's idea of having specialised schools for the disabled looks unthinking and cruel . <p> I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes the scenario is not black or white , with Hanson being in the black . 
 <h> EDITORIAL : So-called ' populism ' is democracy in action <p> The so-called " rise of populism " has been the subject of much fulmination from political pundits and politicians themselves in recent times . <p> From Donald Trump to Brexit , from the Greens to One Nation , we 're told the emergence of the populist bogeyman is a threat to the foundations of Western democracy , eroding the majorities of the established parties and impeding their ability to govern in the " sensible centre " . <p> But in a world where anyone whose views differ from those of the Labor and Liberal orthodoxies is branded " populist " , dismissing these other points of view is fundamentally undemocratic . <p> By all means , the fact an idea is popular does not make it right -- as many of the policies of Trump and Pauline Hanson make clear -- but nor does it automatically make it wrong . <p> It has been said that the likes of Trump and Hanson were elected on a wave of support courtesy of a general dissatisfaction with the establishment parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , but at least they offer an alternative . <p> Indeed , voters are right to be wary of anyone who tries to claim the only sensible choices are between institutions so fundamentally flawed as either of the two major parties , here or in the United States . <p> But it 's easy to understand why this attitude prevails among political commentators of all stripes , many of whom have vested interests in maintaining the status quo . <p> We 're often told , for example , that a vote for a party with " radical " ideas will be bad for the economy , when what this really means is it will be bad for established interests who already control much of the money and power , and for whom change , any change , is inherently bad . <p> From their point of view , everything is just fine the way it is . <p> Like the new and troubling tendency of politicians to label inconvenient truths " fake news " , the populist bogeyman is in many cases actually a straw man used to argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in positions of power . <p> To be sure , the chances of my preferencing a One Nation candidate anything other than dead last on a ballot ( unless Cory Bernardi happens to be running in that electorate ) are slim to nil , but the fact voters are choosing to break the shackles of the duopoly is not only not a threat to democracy , it is democracy in action . 
 <h> Glass solar panels : A window into the future <p> OUR FUTURE Imagine a future where buildings , offices , homes and cars generate their own power . <p> Imagine a future where buildings , offices , homes and cars generate their own power by the very construction materials with which they 're built . Now stop imagining , because that future is now . <p> As Australia moves away from fossil fuel-based energy sources towards those that are renewable , we should consider innovative ways to produce and consume electricity in a way that improves our lifestyles . <p> The benefits of solar panels are many -- yet they still have to be added to our existing infrastructures and are opaque . I wondered ... what about if we add new capabilities to existing solar panels by transforming them into " smart " building material ? This could change the way the world works . <p> I devised intelligent glass . Just like glass , it 's transparent . However , it also has superior insulating properties , decreases infrared radiation and , most importantly , produces electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its ability to be less transparent , if desired , means it 's an ideal fit for an office or home . <p> Buildings are responsible for about 40 per cent of our energy consumption every year , as well as of our carbon emissions . If we 're aiming for net zero buildings ( where the total amount of energy used equals the amount of energy created on site ) then imagine the massive opportunities for intelligent glass ! <p> There 's a lot of innovation happening in the renewable energy sector , including smart software that allows neighbors to trade energy . Such advances could become the next global phenomenon in renewable energy technology . So , how are our governments and policy makers supporting this wave of innovation ? We must grab this opportunity and shape the future of our energy generation , now . <p> Victor Rosenberg is executive chairman of Australian company ClearVue Technology which developed the world 's first clear , energy harvesting glass . 
 <h> Yearning for the old days <p> Whatever happened to the open-wood fires and other simple things in life like reading a very nice book , a skipping rope , and toasting scones over the open fire in the evenings . <p> Now it is all loud music and computers , internet and Facebook . All these things are not needed . <p> Bring back the horse and cart days , then this world would be a better place to live in for sure . <h> Ellen Crofts , Bendigo <h> Case against euthanasia <p> The Victorian Parliament is about to debate a bill on physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia in some form . <p> To enable doctors to " hasten a patient 's death " is a very risky thing indeed . <p> The article in Saturday 's Bendigo Advertiser includes a comment " the patient exercised their right to refuse medical treatment " . That is within any patient 's right . <p> The article seems to confuse palliative care and assisted suicide . Being pain free is a vital part of palliative care but what is proposed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lulled into a false sense of security when politicians talk about " safeguards " . There are no safe physician-assisted or euthanasia laws . <p> The ministerial panel did not ask whether or not Victorians wanted this type of legislation , but rather , how it should be framed . <p> To say that this is time for Victoria to have such a law seems that the people have no choice but to like it or not . If the Parliament of Victoria was foolish enough to legislate for physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia , this would completely demoralise Victorians living with the feeling of being a burden to their families or society . <p> If such assisted suicide legislation were passed in this state , the improvement and expansion of palliative care skills would be discouraged . <p> The End of Life Choices Inquiry received 35 submissions for such improvements . <p> Not only that , but the health insurance industry would , in time , probably encourage that thinking and feeling . <p> This has happened in various places in the world where assisted suicide and/or euthanasia has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place where there has been a profound shift in attitude toward medical care -- a new fear and secrecy . <p> This year Oregon has a bill expanding the existing physician aid in dying law , SB 494 , which seeks to allow medically vulnerable persons , patients who are awake , conscious and aware to be denied food and water -- even by spoon . This bill has passed the Senate . Also in Oregon , health care funds have decided that physician-assisted suicide was a better option -- for them -- than the financial burden of medical treatment . <p> The Australian Law Reform Commission says powers of attorney are being used by children as a " licence to steal " from their elderly parents . Vulnerable elderly or disabled persons would be exposed to the risk of coercion which would be difficult to detect . <p> There are many reasons to reject any bill seeking to legalise doctor-assisted suicide in any form , but removing the prohibition of intentional killing -- which is the cornerstone of law and social relationships -- is a major consideration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult , if not impossible , to remove . <h> Helen Leach , Bendigo <h> Debasing the flag <p> The way I learnt it , the Aussie flag belonged in one or two places ; either up a flagpole or over the coffin of a notable dead Australian . <p> It most certainly never belonged on the backs of so-called patriots and wrapped around their faces to conceal their identities . The debasement of our flag as a symbol to promote the filth pretending to be patriots is disgusting .

 <h> Finding a way through smoke and vapours <p> It is clear Bendigo has a health problem when it comes to smoking , with significantly higher rates of smokers than the national average and all the attendant health problems . <p> The indicators are this is also a vice that afflicts lower socio-economic groups more harshly and is more prevalent amongst older people . <p> In short , those who have smoked for a long time probably picked up the habit when it was more normalised and are now finding it increasingly difficult to quit . <p> The issue of whether e-cigarettes can play a role helping people to quit has again been raised by advocates as an option . <p> So far , only products that have been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration can be marketed as quitting aids and no electronic cigarette has received approval . In Victoria , it is not illegal to sell non-nicotine electronic cigarettes , but laws passed last year that will come into effect on August 1 ban the sale of all electronic cigarettes to people under the age of 18 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products . <p> This week Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation president Dr Alex Wodak made the claim nicotine vaping products are less harmful than combustible tobacco and as many smokers would never be able to give up , an option is a good public health solution . He used the emotional comparison to a parliamentary committee in Queensland of methadone treatment for heroin addiction ; " Most parents would rather have their son or daughter alive and on methadone than dead and not on methadone . " <p> This , of course , is focused chiefly on the argument that vaping is a therapeutic aid and not another marketing ploy by big tobacco eyeing off young , untapped markets where tobacco restrictions have made successful inroads . <p> The advertising certainly seems to be targeting a more sophisticated , younger market with its flavours and products and not those simply desperate to give up . <p> Equally , such a solution is going to be of little attraction to the lower socio-economic smoking group , arguably those most in need of help , when the prices of these products are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning to the bulk of public health advocates is the unmeasured harm of vaping , particularly if it contains nicotine , whether people do stop smoking at all and the precedent behaviour it sets for another generation . 
 <p> Writer , explorer and cultural commentator Robyn Davidson is most famous for her book Tracks , less known is her powerful connection to the Australian sheep industry . <p> " There is lanolin running in these veins , " she told 300 enthralled attendees at the eighth Australian Sheep and Wool Show 's Women of Wool event yesterday . <p> She grew up in the " tiny , daring " community of Mooloolah , Queensland , where her family , with " foolish pluck " raised sheep . <p> She poetically described the gruelling conditions faced by the family 's mob of 250 Border Leicesters and Romney sheep , who like many other British migrants at the time , found Australia " harsh , horrid and whinged " . <p> " Our sheep whinged about the floods in which they died by the score , they whinged about the sub-tropical conditions that gave them footrot and blowflies to infest their tails , " Ms Davidson said . <p> " They whinged about the wild dogs that found their way through the dingo-proof netting to disembowel them and eat their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather in which they decided to give birth . " <p> During this period , she said the 1950s was tough for woman with the " cramping " expectations and social limitations placed upon them . <p> " I suspect that while many things have improved for people on the land , for women in particular , some basic ingredients remain the same , " she said . <p> " Coping with the inherent anxieties of dependency on weather and banks , the difficulty of schooling children , of having a social life and trying to be a good manager that is not trashing the country but still trying to earn a decent living from it . " <p> She spoke about the connection between her former nomadic life , which included her solo odyssey across Australia with her dog and four camels , and the similarity of a farmer , both requiring an inherent connection to the land and environment in which they survive . <p> " Country people all develop affection for their own bit of bush , though it has taken time for scientific knowledge to percolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruthlessness of our forefathers , " Ms Davidson said . <p> " What you do to the land today will rebound in its productivity tomorrow . What you give to it today will be re-payed to you in the future and in your children 's future . " <p> " In all the nomadic cultures I have come across , the woman tended to have a great deal more worth and power than in equivalent sedentary societies . <p> " They were hugely important component in the economic structure of their world -- the men were in awe of them , and a bit scared of them .

Why do we suspect that a fair amount of product was consumed in the creation of these labels ? <p> +++ <p> A few weeks back , DTM threw out a call for anyone who knew anything at all about an unresolved Unidentified Flying Object report in Bendigo from May 1983 which turned up in an Australian Air Force investigation report 30 years later . <p> We had a detailed response from a very well-known and respected Bendigo bloke -- he even has a gong . His name is ... well , his initials are Dennis , and as usual , this **32;642;TOOLONG bloke made clear sense . <p> He said that back in 1983 he and some staff and colleagues at the old Bendigo College of Advanced Education were carrying out some experiments .

 <h> Square beats Hurst to take hold of top spot <p> GOLDEN Square held Sandhurst to just one behind at the Barnard Street end of the Queen Elizabeth Oval across the second and fourth quarters on Saturday to end a string of six losses in a row against the Dragons . <p> The Bulldogs moved into top spot on the BFNL ladder with their 27-point victory -- 11.14 ( 80 ) to 8.5 ( 53 ) . <p> Of the eight goals the Dragons kicked , they booted six in the third quarter when they rallied from 19 points down at half-time to take a four-point advantage -- and the momentum -- into the final term . <p> However , the Bulldogs weathered the surge from the Dragons , controlling the final term from the moment Adam Baird ran onto a kind bounce and into an open goal to give Golden Square back the lead for good . <p> The Bulldogs finished with 4.7 to no score in the last quarter as they extended their winning streak to eight in a row and beat the Dragons for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win moved the Bulldogs to 10-2 and top of the ladder , the reigning premier Dragons -- who opened the season $1.55 flag favourites with Sportsbet -- are now outside the top five after 12 rounds . <p> The star for the Bulldogs was again key forward Travis Baird , who continued his career-best form to be one of the key differences between the two sides . <p> Baird bagged six goals , with his haul coming on the back of returns of six , eight and five in his previous three games . <p> His first five goals came from marks , while his sixth from a snap broke the game wide open as it put the Bulldogs 22 points up at the 14-minute mark of the last term . <p> It was the final goal of the game , with the Bulldogs ' final five scores all behinds . <p> Baird should have kicked seven , but hit the post 25m out straight in front early in the final term . <p> It was a breakout game for Sandhurst 's Oscar McKinley , who kicked three goals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dragons ' charge , while he also provided the highlight of the match with his brilliant soaring mark over the top of Jon Coe in the third term . <p> On what was a perfect day for football , just seven goals were kicked in the first half -- Square led 5.5 to 2.4 -- as the defences of both sides were on top , stoppages were constant and the ball regularly sailed out on the full on the swimming pool wing . <p> The Dragons did n't help their cause in the second term when Zac East ( twice ) and Lee Coghlan sprayed shots at goal out on the full . 
 <p> FOR the second time this season Colbinabbin and Huntly have gone down to the wire against each other in the Heathcote District league . <p> But unlike round five when the Hawks won by six points , this time it was the Grasshoppers who prevailed on Saturday at home . <p> In a pivotal match between the two teams vieing for third spot and the double chance , the Grasshoppers snuck over the line by five points , 14.13 ( 97 ) to 14.8 ( 92 ) , in only their third win in their past 10 clashes against the Hawks . <p> The victory keeps the Grasshoppers in third position , with their buffer on the Hawks -- who have a game in hand -- now eight points , plus 22.3 per cent , with four rounds remaining . <p> " I 'm really proud of the boys ...

 <h> Editorial : First in many steps in a bigger war on waste <p> There can be little doubt that losing the expectation of getting something for free will annoy more than a few people when the major supermarkets decide to ban plastic bags and replace them with heavier bags they can purchase . <p> Expectation is an odd thing . Bunnings and Aldi have never offered free bags but people have adapted without too much angst . Now the challenge is to really change behaviour . A report from the US on the nine billion tonnes of plastic produced worldwide since 1950 reveals less than a quarter is still be used , meaning seven billion tonnes of it is in landfill or clogging up the waterways and oceans of the world . It is a grim enough picture to demand action . <p> And if the sense of urgency does n't sink in about this wastefulness , in those 70 years more than half has been produced in the last 30 and is used once and tossed away . <p> So while the bag ban represents a small positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is plastics and wider waste of an accelerating consumer society . Bans imposed in South Australia and the ACT found that while there are decreases of almost 40 per cent in the number of bags reaching landfill , there is a subsequent rise in the sale of heavier plastic bags or bin liners , designed specifically for rubbish which , like purchased shopping bags that are n't reused , represent heavier and therefore more plastic ending up in waste . Add potentially more toxic colouring and you have the potential for worse environmental outcomes . <p> Looking at the carelessly discarded element of waste , a recent Keep Australia Beautiful litter report found that the bags represent only 1 per cent of litter . This leaves a vast amount of improvement room for drink containers , fast food packaging and some of the other key culprits that make up the other 99 per cent of litter . <p> Other academics have also been keen to point out even shopping bags made of alternative materials like paper or canvas bags have environmental impacts and require significant re-use to equal the lightweight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cotton bags in terms of resource use , energy and greenhouse outcomes . <p> So while in itself the bag ban has been referred to as a " nudge " policy , helping change behaviour through slight and slow incentives , the real challenge lies in a much wider rethinking of how we use and re-use plastics -- no matter how hard that is. 
 <h> Facing ' narcotics emergency ' , Indonesia ramps up war on drugs <p> Jewel Topsfield and Karuni Aug 2017 , 10:40 p.m . <p> Government agency says 50 per cent of drug circulation in the country is controlled from prisons . <p> Jakarta : Within days of Indonesian President Joko Widodo ordering police to shoot drug dealers who resist arrest , the government last week announced a radical shake-up of the nation 's prisons . <p> Amid revelations that prisoners continue to operate drug syndicates behind bars , the Ministry of Law and Human Rights has come up with an ambitious plan to consolidate drug felons in four jails across the nation . <p> According to Corrections data the level of drug activity behind bars in Indonesia is extraordinary : of the nation 's 225,000 prisoners there are 54,000 dealers and 32,000 users . <p> Jokowi , as he is popularly known , is once again claiming Indonesia is facing a narcotics " emergency " , with the BNN pointing to five million drug users , 27 per cent of whom are " active users " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2015 , when he used a national drugs emergency to justify the executions of drug felons including Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan . <p> The latest crackdown has alarmed human rights activists who point to " sinister echoes " of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte 's " war on drugs " , which has seen more than 7000 drug dealers and users killed . <p> " From practice in the field , we see that when we shoot at drug dealers they go away , " the National Police Chief , General Tito Karnavian was quoted saying in The Jakarta Post , in an apparent reference to the Philippines . <p> General Tito vowed police would be particularly firm on foreign drug traffickers , whom Indonesians largely blame for the scourge of drugs . <p> Shortly after Jokowi 's edict , police showered an alleged crystal methamphetamine dealer , who they said resisted arrest , with seven bullets in Pekanbaru on the island of Sumatra on July 29 . <p> However some question whether the tough stance on drugs is more about political populism than a spiralling drug emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drugs and Crime , general population prevalence rates of most illegal and illicit drugs in Indonesia largely remained stable since the early 2000s , " Claudia Stoicescu , a doctoral researcher at University of Oxford 's Centre for Evidence Based Intervention , writes in Al Jazeera . <p> " Far from constituting an outlier , Indonesia 's annual rates of drug consumption are similar to rates in other South-East Asian countries such as Vietnam and Myanmar and much lower than rates in the United States and much of Europe . " <p> The Indonesian Drug Users Network ( PKNI ) , an NGO established to fight the stigma and discrimination faced by drug users , believes Jokowi 's order to shoot drug dealers who resisted arrest was made in haste . <p> His comments - in a speech to a political party meeting - came after four Taiwanese men were arrested and another shot dead for allegedly distributing one tonne of crystal meth in Jakarta . <p> " Besides , by shooting them to death the police can not uncover their network properly . So I think killing them should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the People 's Movement Against Drugs - said when the police shot dead drug dealers in the 90s the business was drastically reduced . <p> " Whenever the government wants to uphold the law human rights stand in the way , " founder Sofyan Ali told Fairfax Media . <p> He said Jokowi was a good president , who unlike previous presidents , " knows what he does because he goes down to the field " . <p> " Other countries like the Philippines or the US take action whenever they see a situation that threatens their people . They forget human rights because the situation is causing a real problem , " Sofyan said . <p> " But it does n't happen here . We fight against our own people on human rights so we may achieve nothing . " <p> Meanwhile the plan to contain drug offenders in four prisons in West Java , North Sumatra , Central Java and Central Kalimantan was hatched after a prisoner named on Nusakambangan - Indonesia 's equivalent of Alcatraz - was linked to 1.2 million ecstasy pills seized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including weapons and x-ray machines . Prison officers , who are often involved in drug syndicates , would be strictly vetted . <p> " The biggest problem right now is drug dealers inside jails and our officers are overwhelmed , " the Security Director from Corrections , , told reporters . <p> He said the ratio of officers to prisoners was one to 62 , when the recommended ratio was one to 20 . <p> " So we must take extraordinary steps by strengthening the officers , by collaborating with BNN the national narcotics agency and the police .

 <h> Bendigo Advertiser letters to the editor <h> Web behind retail decline <p> With people 's shopping habits the whole world over changing so rapidly , I fail to understand how our city council can , or is even expected , to fix Bendigo 's retail problems . <p> I shop how , when and where I choose , and I would expect most people to be of the same opinion . <p> Perhaps to gain an understanding of the shopping habits of those living in the Bendigo area , a survey of people employed by some of our larger businesses such as the Bendigo Bank staff , Bendigo Health and the Greater City of Bendigo , staff would give our council a broad overview and a better understanding of why not only Bendigo , but many other cities and towns , are faced with the same retail problem . <p> It is my guess that the survey , if carried out , will show that online shopping , along with ease in which we can travel to major cities , plays a huge part in the demise of country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Melbourne with a promise of ' buy today have your item delivered today ' . This type of service will impact heavily on our already troubled retail sector . <p> Bendigo is a beautiful city with many wonderful attractions , let our council concentrate on these areas . The retail sector will given time take care of itself . <h> Lorna Wight , Bendigo <h> Terrorism threat is real <p> I found your editorial ( " Numbers do n't add up for terrorism threat " , August 3 ) to be mischievous and misleading . <p> To begin with , you state that " just three people have died as victims of terrorist attacks in Australia " . You then go on to list the number of deaths attributed to such things as police shootings , domestic violence and " falling off vehicles " , amongst many others . <p> I ask : is this some kind of warped statistical contest ? Exactly how many Australian citizens have to die at the hands of Islamic extremists before the threat of terrorism in this country is given recognition ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was murdered in cold blood at the Brighton apartments in early June of this year by Islamic extremist Yacqub Khayre , a man earlier acquitted of planning to storm the Holsworthy Army Barracks in Sydney with automatic weapons and kill as many people as possible . <p> His three compatriots were sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment , the sentencing judge noting that they were " unrepentant radical Muslims who would remain a threat to the public " . <p> Is it my imagination , or were a number of men arrested in Sydney just recently on suspicion of plotting to blow up an aircraft ? And , in fact , it appears that we have now learned that prior to their arrest these individuals came perilously close to actually getting an improvised explosive device on board a plane but failed in that attempt . <p> Let us not forget Numan Haider , who attempted to murder two police officers outside the Endeavour Hills Police Station . And two men and two teenagers have just pleaded guilty to conspiring to blow up government buildings in 2014 . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has stated : " Here in Australia , it is only good intelligence gathering and probably a little bit of luck that have helped us avoid ( so far ) a full blown mass casualty terrorist event similar to those in the UK and Europe . " <p> Many experts have stated that such an horrific event occurring in Australia is not a matter of " if " but " when " . <p> I found it offensive that your editorial seemed to go to great lengths to trivialise the growing threat of terrorism in our society ; even going so far as to describe this belief as a " sham " and that interest in it by the general populace is due only to the fact that it is a more " exciting " subject than " road accidents or people drinking too much " . <p> I believe that you have insulted the intelligence of your readers in this regard . The threat of terrorism in Australia is real . 
 <h> Part of Calder Alternative to close for three months <p> Part of the Calder Alternative Highway will be closed to all Melbourne-bound traffic for three months from next week as work on the Ravenswood Interchange upgrade continues . <p> To allow construction of the elevated circular road to continue , the southbound lane of the highway will be closed to traffic between the Road and the Calder Highway for three months from August 17 . <p> The northbound lane towards Marong will remain open while the work is under way and a signed detour route will be in place for southbound drivers , including freight vehicles , via Lockwood Road and the Calder Highway . <p> As part of the works , the U-turn bay near Beilharz Road will also close permanently from the same day . <p> As the bay will not reopen to traffic , drivers wanting to travel southbound on the Calder Highway are advised to use the U-turn bay located near Belvoir Park Road . <p> Construction on the $86 million upgrade began in February , with $41 million in state government funding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once complete , the Ravenswood Interchange will become a Victorian-first elevated circular roadway that will separate freight and slow-moving traffic from faster moving traffic . <p> Truck drivers will no longer have to stop , wait in the median and accelerate to join traffic to enter the Calder Highway as they head towards Melbourne . <p> When work began earlier this year , the state government forecast the project would contribute up to 800 jobs to the local economy . <p> The intersection was dubbed " arguably the most dangerous intersection anywhere in Victoria " by former-Premier Denis Napthine , after recording seven casualty crashes in the five years to June 30 , 2012 . <p> In 2014 a 30-year-old woman was killed in a crash at the intersection , in which two men and an 8-year-old girl were also injured . <p> The crash occurred when the vehicle the woman was driving collided with a cement truck . 
 <h> Young at Heart Choice should be a part of life and death <p> Two Christian archbishops and five bishops have written a letter criticising the Victorian Government for planning to introduce legislation to support medically-assisted dying ... dying with dignity . <p> Considering that the 2016 census reveals a decline in Christian affiliation and a sharp rise in those who identify as having no religion , I question why this group of bishops believes it can speak with such authority . Yes , I acknowledge their right to speak out , but equally the authority they once represented is no longer so powerful . <p> The debate around dying with dignity laws should not be about religion , politics or personal glory . This is purely about the right of those who wish to have a choice in the time of their dying , when pain becomes intolerable , and people diagnosed as terminally i 'll . <p> Once again Christian spokespeople believe they have some God-given right to attempt to stop a law allowing people the right to make that decision for themselves . <p> This is simply about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance to die unless they wish to take up the option . There are a list of strict safeguards which will protect the vulnerable , those with dementia , those who may feel they are being coerced by family , so why the concern ? <p> I have nothing but praise for the social work the churches constantly provide today , sheltering the homeless , assisting those in need of counselling , fostering families in crises . It 's the churches , not the state , who are picking up the pieces of people 's lives and helping put them together again . We have good communities who care compassionately for these people . <p> And yet it is the Christian religious in particular who appear on the back foot when it comes to supporting more contemporary ideas and beliefs . They continue to present last century arguments against changing mores around social issues in our community . <p> Those in the church hierarchy have made known their views against same-sex marriage , and they are again at their most strident as the Victorian Government considers passing legislation to allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own choosing , when life has become an intolerable one of pain , discomfort and distress . <p> I am not a Catholic , but I am of the generation which first experienced the freedom and choice to take the contraceptive pill . <p> I watched Catholic women friends suffer the full fury of the Catholic Church . Some damned by the same priests who were found later to be sexually assaulting children . The hypocrisy was breathtaking . Women braved the might of the Catholic Church and ignored the outrage from the pulpit . <p> The same could be said for dying with dignity if this legislation is passed . Those heartbreaking last few days or weeks for both sufferer and family could become a thing of the past , if legalised dying with dignity became an option . <p> Arguments supporting assisted dying legislation have grown in recent years as our population ages and is better educated and informed than previous generations . They are able to present powerful and compelling arguments towards supporting this legislation . The bishops who proclaim that ' dying laws devalue life ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain , or the indignity of daily living with a failing body . 
 <p> Barrister Emrys Nekvapil told the court the his two clients were aware of ECT . <p> " Each of my clients understands this procedure and is terrified of it , " he said . <p> The case focuses on whether a person has the capacity to give informed consent and how treatment options should be considered . <p> Both patients reject their diagnoses of schizophrenia and say they retain the capacity to make informed decisions about treatment , Mr Nekvapil said . <p> Outside court , Victoria Legal Aid spokesman Dan Nicholson said it was the first time the provisions of the state 's Mental Health Act have been tested in the Supreme Court . <p> " This is a case about ensuring that important legislative safeguards about compulsory electroconvulsive therapy are made a reality and that people can have as much say in their medical treatment as possible , even when they 're unwell , " he said . <p> Neither patient had legal representation when ordered to undergo ECT by the state 's Mental Health Tribunal . 
 <p> Victoria Legal Aid director civil justice access and equity Dan Nicholson speaks to the media in front of the Supreme Court as the court considers the forced electro-convulsive therapy case of a Bendigo woman . <p> A BENDIGO woman challenging an order for forced electro-shock therapy has been robbed of the " dignity of choice " , her lawyer has told a Supreme Court hearing . <p> The woman , known as NJE , is one of two Victorians challenging their forced electroconvulsive treatment orders in a test case for the Mental Health Act , updated in 2014 . <p> She objected to the order while a patient of Bendigo Health earlier this year , but the order was upheld by the Mental Health Tribunal and the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal . <p> The Supreme Court is now considering whether ECT can be enforced upon a person who fully understands the procedure , but opposes it . VCAT found the fact NJE did not believe she had treatment-resistant schizophrenia meant she was unable to make her own informed decision . <p> The matter is being heard this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less restrictive means available for the person to receive treatment , if there is a serious risk of deterioration of the person 's mental health without the treatment , and if there are risks to others if the treatment does not go ahead . <p> The court heard opening arguments from Emrys Nekvapil earlier this week , representing NJE and the other person PBU , on behalf of Victoria Legal Aid . <p> He told the court the Mental Health Act was changed in 2014 to give more rights to people with mental illness . <p> " This act , in our submission , was intended to alter the balance , to give greater autonomy to persons engaging in this system , " Mr Nekvapil said . <p> " The approach here , although it 's not back to those days , it still does n't look sufficiently to the world as experienced by the patient , and the dignity of choice , which the act is supposed to protect and promote . " <p> VCAT found NJE could understand and remember information about ECT , but could not " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give informed consent . <p> Mr Nekvapil said this was an " error " on the part of the tribunal 's judgement , and said NJE was using all the information she found to be relevant . <p> " It describes her reasoning process , but it then says her decision was made without prior consideration , even though the tribunal has just referred to her prior consideration and to the reasons she had for refusing ECT , " he said . <p> " In one way , it at least engages with the test more but it does it in a way that does n't really , with respect , try and see this person as an autonomous individual who might have their own reasons for not wanting ECT . <p> " Whether the tribunal thinks that those are good reasons or reasonable reasons , it really does n't engage with the fact that she gone through her own process of consideration . " <p> ECT involves placing a person under general anesthetic and muscle relaxant , before running electric currents through the brain causing seizures . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illnesses . <p> NJE was ordered to receive up to 12 rounds of the treatment at Bendigo Health . Doctors claimed they had tried to engage with NJE about the treatment . <p> PBU has already undergone ECT in a Melbourne hospital , but has objected to any more courses . <p> A UK court case involving a Jehovah 's Witness who refused a blood transfusion was used as an example of how the rights and decisions of a patient are paramount . <p> In that case , the presiding justices found every adult has the right and capacity to refuse medical treatment . <p> Mr Nekvapil said in order to consent to a procedure , the person only had to understand its nature . <p> He said patients in Victoria also confronted a " power imbalance " when they appeared before the Mental Health Tribunal to argue their case . <p> " If a person feels that they 're not being heard as part of their consultation process , then their response to the frustration of that may manifest in something which is then taken to indicate incapacity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not receive the treatment until the Supreme Court hands down its judgement later this year . <p> Supreme Court Justice Kevin Bell said it was a complex matter . <p> " I think the tribunal 's really saying , look , this is a terribly difficult problem , " he told the court . <p> " We 've got two people who are squandering under the existent treatment regime . <p> " Their life 's not getting any better . Medically , they 're not improving . Their quality of life is poor . It could be so much better on ECT . " <p> Justice Bell said there was also a risk that ECT would cause a deterioration to their health . <p> " If we have patients who do not wish to have ECT because they 're terrified of what it might do to them , and they want to remain under the current treatment regime ... yet one can foresee on medical evidence gradual deterioration to a position of even more grave want of health ... what 's to happen ? " he asked . 
 <h> Kooka 's hungry for bite of online market <p> As its products disappear from Woolworths shelves outside Victoria and Tasmania , a Donald biscuit manufacturer is making a new play for a slice of the online market . <p> Just two weeks after Woolworths told Kooka 's Country Cookies their biscuits would no longer be stocked outside the two southern states , the regional Victorian company has signed up with online retailer . <p> The website matches shoppers directly with Australian farmers and manufacturers , circumventing supermarkets and returning more profit to the supplier . <p> Farmers and manufacturers deliver their produce to the warehouse , from which it is delivered to online shoppers . <p> Kooka 's sales manager Kerry Vogel said the movement online was " something a bit different " for the 23-year-old biscuit manufacturer and hoped it could patch the revenue gap left by Woolworths . <p> " I think a lot of people are going that way now , ordering online , and they 're looking to buy Australian products , " she said . <p> " We have changed with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

 <p> The toll road will link traffic between the West Gate Freeway , CityLink and the CBD via a new tunnel beneath Yarraville and a bridge over the Maribyrnong River . <p> But experts and locals say there are serious flaws in the plans . <p> Peter Somerville has been taking cruises along the Maribyrnong River for 38 years . <p> He said if the bridge was built lower than four metres above the river at high tide he would be forced to wind back his business . <p> " We would only be able to go down at low tide , " said Mr Somerville . <p> A high-profile panel including former Labor minister Justin Madden and former Victorian government architect Geoffrey London are also against the current proposal , and say a radical redesign of the road is needed to allow for urban renewal . <p> The government will present its argument over the road 's likely traffic impacts on Monday . <p> It will be challenged by Melbourne City Council , which argues the toll road 's city off-ramps will flood the streets of North and West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The high-profile figures warned in a report that the bridge and two ramps crossing east over the Maribyrnong River onto Footscray Road did " not satisfactorily respond to the significance of the river and adjacent land use and future development of the Port of Melbourne " . <p> The bridge should be moved " further east " and off-ramps carrying trucks to the Port removed , the report recommended . <p> An artist 's impression of the Maribyrnong river crossing .

 <h> ' Astounding ' : CBA facing potential class action over Austrac scandal <p> Clancy Aug 2017 , 12:44 p.m . <p> The Commonwealth Bank faces a potential investor class action over its disclosure of more than 53,000 alleged breaches of anti-money laundering laws , following a sharp fall in its share price when the scandal emerged earlier this month . <h> ' ' : CBA facing potential class action over Austrac scandal <p> The Commonwealth Bank faces a potential investor class action over its disclosure of more than 53,000 alleged breaches of anti-money laundering laws , following a sharp fall in its share price when the scandal emerged earlier this month . <p> Plaintiff law firm Maurice Blackburn , backed by listed litigation funder IMF Bentham , said on Wednesday it would investigate a potential class action on behalf of CBA shareholders , citing the hit to the bank 's share price . <p> Maurice Blackburn said it was " astounding " that the bank did not tell investors about the alleged breaches earlier . <p> IMF Bentham said it was investigating claims relating to alleged misleading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the bank of its continuous disclosure obligations , relating to Austrac 's legal action against the bank . <p> " Austrac alleges that CBA contravened the AML/CTF Act on more than 53,000 occasions . The Austrac allegations are extensive and it is astounding that the market would not be advised of such serious and repeated breaches as soon as the company became aware of them , " the national head of class actions at Maurice Blackburn , Andrew Watson , said . <p> Mr Watson said he was confident the action would proceed , and its size was likely to be " very large " because of the very high number of shareholders in CBA . <p> Mr Watson pointed to CBA 's own statements that it was aware of thousands of alleged breaches of its obligations to report transactions above $10,000 to Austrac in 2015 , but had not informed the market . <p> He also said the bank had made " specific representations " to the market that it was complying with anti-money laundering laws through its website , and documents used in a capital raising and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frankly , that you could have the level of non-compliance which the Austrac pleadings allege , and a board think that that was not sufficiently material that the shareholders should be informed , " he said . <p> The law firm is taking registrations from shareholders who bought the stock between August 17 , 2015 and August 3 , 2017 , the day the Austrac action was announced . <p> CBA , which has been contacted for comment , has not yet lodged its defence in the Austrac case . <p> Chief executive Ian Narev has previously said it was alerted to two breaches by Austrac in August 2015 , in which it failed to notify authorities of cash deposits above $10,000 . Mr Narev said CBA then looked into the matter and found tens of thousands of such breaches , which it said were caused by a " coding error " . <p> The bank has said it did not become aware of Austrac 's civil suit against it until it was lodged on August 3 . <p> It has not said when it became aware Austrac was conducting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complied with disclosure obligations , which require companies to tell investors about news that is " material " . <p> CBA 's share price fell from an intraday high of $84.69 on the day the Austrac action was announced , a Thursday , and opened at $80.11 on the following Monday , Maurice Blackburn said . <p> " Our investigations and analysis show that this drop was in the top 1 per cent of price movements that CBA experienced in the past five years , making it apparent that the news was of material significance to shareholders , " Mr Watson said . <p> Director of IMF Bentham , Hugh McLernon , said claims from shareholders could be registered from Wednesday . <p> " CBA is facing most serious allegations from Austrac , and there are serious questions to be answered about what the company knew and when , " Mr McLernon said . 
 <p> MOVING the date away from the Australia Day long weekend appears to be the only way to save the Fryerstown Antique Fair , according to the local council . <p> The 2018 fair has been cancelled after emergency services refused to support the event in the middle of summer , in a town with only one main entrance and exit , and attendances that could reach into the thousands . <p> The Fryerstown Antique Fair committee believes the event must be held in the small town of 200 people , otherwise it would no longer be the " Fryerstown " fair . <p> Mount Alexander Shire Council mayor Sharon Telford said moving the date further back in the year would be the likely solution to allay fire concerns and to ensure the fair remained in Fryerstown . <p> " If they had the fair at a time of the year when the fire danger is not so great , then it could still be possible to have the fair in Fryerstown , " she said . <p> " At the moment the risk is just too great . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town . " <p> Mount Alexander Shire attempted to help the committee find a new venue , offering to hold the event at the Campbells Creek Recreation Reserve , about eight kilometres away from Fryerstown . <p> The antique fair committee voted against that option , however . <p> Cr Telford said it was ultimately up to the committee to find a solution to save the fair , which attracts 20,000 people over several days and has been held for 43 years . <p> " It 's a very active community and the townspeople are desperately trying to figure it out , " she said . <p> " There are people on that committee who have been volunteering since the very beginning , it 's been an extraordinary effort . <p> " It 's very important for Fryerstown . " <p> The cancellation could be a boon for the Maldon Antique Fair , held two weeks after Fryerstown . Cr Telford said stallholders have been contacting Maldon in an attempt to secure a stall . <h> ' No way ' town could be evacuated during fire <p> A committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of people could be quickly evacuated from Fryerstown in the event of a bushfire during the late-January event . <p> The committee is made up of members from Victoria Police , the CFA , Mount Alexander Shire Council and DELWP . <p> They released a statement regarding the cancellation of the popular antique fair , stating there were too many risks in holding the fair in Fryerstown during a period of high fire danger . <p> " While the Fryerstown bushland setting is iconic , there is no way that thousands of people could quickly and safely evacuate the fair in the event of a bushfire , " the statement read . <p> " Holding the event during the high fire danger at that time of year at that location means there is an extreme risk to the public in the event of a bushfire . <p> " We remain committed to working with fair organisers to identify alternative dates or venues and to support the event through marketing and promotion , should organisers wish to reconsider .

 <p> AS Victoria on Thursday farewells Australia 's first minister for the prevention of family violence , there are calls for ' Fiona 's Law ' to be passed to ensure her plan for long-term funding is protected by legislation . <p> The Minister for Women and Prevention of Family Violence , Fiona Richardson , passed away last week after a prolonged battle with cancer . <p> She has been remembered as a champion for women , and for her advocacy for gender equality and the prevention of violence against women and children . <p> Ms Richardson was responsible for overseeing the Royal Commission into Family Violence , having Respectful Relationships added to the state curriculum and developing the state 's first gender equality strategy . <p> A statement released by husband Stephen and children Marcus and Catherine , remembered Ms Richardson as " an unwavering advocate on behalf of victim-survivors and every Victorian touched by the tragedy of family violence ' ' . " She achieved so much for victims in a short space of time , ' ' her family wrote . <p> The final report from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all of which the Victorian government has agreed to implement . <p> Annie North women 's refuge chief executive Julie Oberin said Victoria was " now seen as leading the way nationally and to some degree internationally , since the Victorian government not only committed to implementing all of the Royal Commission recommendations , but released unprecedented funds to ensure that the implementation had the best possible chance of achieving the recommendations ' ' . " But there is still unfinished work , ' ' she said . <p> " Ms Richardson was planning dedicated and long term funding for prevention work , protected by legislation . She had the vision to understand the importance of the prevention work and the determination to protect it from the whim of future governments . It would be a world first and a flagship move which we must continue to advocate for . <p> " Fiona 's Chief of Staff referred to it as ' Fiona 's Law ' and I think that would be a fitting tribute . I hope that all parties support the introduction of this legislation .

' ' <p> Many across the state will also be pausing to reflect on their own memories of the Minister for Women and Minister for Prevention of Family Violence , and how she changed lives . <p> It is my sad and solemn duty to confirm that Fiona Richardson has passed away at the age of 50. https : <p> Ms met Ms Richardson when the minister 's office requested an informal meeting while she was visiting Bendigo a few years ago . <p> " Ms Richardson came , without any fanfare , and spent a couple of hours with us , and listened to our experience of delivering services to our community , ' ' Ms said . <p> " She was particularly interested in how we were working to maximise the safety of women and children and hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms Richardson was incredibly aware of the drivers of violence against women and that the only way we were going to prevent this from occurring in the long term , was to hold gender equality at the core of all of our work and efforts . ' ' <p> From that day , Ms Richardson continued to impress Ms with her " knowledge and insight into the issues impacting on women and children , specialist family violence services and the broader system " . <p> " She also was very impressed with the integrated safety led model we have developed over the last 10 to 12 years and stated publicly that our model was the blueprint for future service reform , ' ' she said . <p> Ms Richardson told the Bendigo Advertiser in August , 2016 , the Centre for Non-Violence was being looked at as a best practice model that could be rolled out across the state . <p> Rosie Batty , Premier Daniel Andrews and Fiona Richardson , Minister for the Prevention of Family Violence , at the release of the report by the Royal Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim . <p> She said the centre was regarded as a leader and offered " a model that could be easily replicated in other communities around Victoria ' ' following recommendations to come out of the Royal Commission into Family Violence . <p> " I 'm particularly excited by their approach and particularly the good outcomes they deliver for women and children , ' ' Ms Richardson said . " So , how we can learn from that and learn from their innovation in particular and the take that model and road test it in other parts of the state is a critical part of the work we 're doing . <p> " Most hub services will separate out the perpetrator from the victim or they wo n't have perpetrator responses at all , whereas the centre takes an holistic view and never loses sight of the child in that work . As a consequence of that rather sophisticated approach , it gets better outcomes for families and women and children in particular . " <p> Ms said Ms Richardson led her portfolio with a " quiet and insistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more effective in both responding to , and preventing family violence ' ' . <p> " She was also a wonderful advocate for specialist women 's services and for the experience of victim/survivors . That she herself was a survivor of violence made her capacity for advocacy even more meaningful , ' ' she said . <p> " We will miss Ms Richardson immensely , however the legacy she leaves behind is the landmark 227 Royal Commission into Family Violence recommendations which are being implemented in full . <p> Ms Richardson was incredibly aware of the drivers of violence against women and that the only way we were going to prevent this from occurring in the long term , was to hold gender equality at the core of all of our work and efforts . - Margaret <p> " Her work has also ensured that record levels of investment have been made to respond to and prevent family violence and work towards gender equality .

' ' <p> " She wanted to see things first hand , and importantly she was determined to listen to the voices of women who had experienced family violence when it came to designing a new system response for family violence reform , ' ' she said . <p> " She was the first Minister for Family Violence Prevention , and she developed Victoria 's first Gender Equality Strategy which is now seen as a benchmark . <p> " She knew the link between gender equality and violence against women and she knew that family violence was not going to stop while gender inequality existed . " <p> Importantly , Ms Oberin said , Ms Richardson " did things because they needed to be done , not so as to be recognised for the work ' ' . <p> " She said ' we can do more , and we must ' .

 <h> Junction Hotel suitors told of financial stress <p> TWO men negotiating over the Junction Hotel claim its owners were in financial difficulty in the lead-up to a fire that destroyed the premises in 2014 . <p> The hotel 's then-owner Jozef Jansen , 65 , and his son Remco Jansen , 42 , appeared at the second day of a trial in the Bendigo County Court after pleading not guilty to a charge of arson for gain . <p> The court heard evidence from Michael Stevens , who paid $20,000 and $2000 deposits on the hotel in Ravenswood in August 2013 with a view to purchasing the pub . <p> He started moving belongings into the Junction Hotel in 2014 and held garage sales from the premises , and was close to signing the contract when he found out about a VicRoads overlay on the property . <p> " They were just wanting me to sign as quick as I could , " Mr Stevens told the court . <p> " I just knew they were having a lot of financial problems . " <p> He pulled out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . <p> Mr Stevens said he lost a lot of belongings in the fire , and claimed he never received his deposit back from the Jansens . <p> The court was told that in mid-2013 , local winemaker Scott Harrington also took an interest in the property . He attempted to negotiate a lease for the Junction Hotel , to turn it into a cellar door for wine and cider , and claimed he signed a heads of agreement with Jozef Jansen . <p> The deal was cancelled however , when Mr Stevens signalled his intention of buying the property with no plans of leasing it to Mr Harrington . <p> Mr Harrington told the court the Jansens were keen to sell rather than lease because of their financial issues . <p> " They were currently experiencing some hardship with their mortgage , they were in arrears of their mortgage , " he said . <p> Jozef Jansen has also been charged with obtaining property by deception , for claiming more than $300,000 from APIA . <p> In his opening address , prosecutor Kevin Doyle told the court the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank in May 2014 . <p> Jozef Jansen lived in the Junction Hotel with his wife . <p> The court heard his wife booked them into a motel in Moama for June 9 -- the night of the fire . The booking was made on June 6 , the day they found out the sale with Mr Stevens had fallen through . <p> Jozef Jansen purchased the hotel from Barry Lyons for $152,000 in 2007 , and initially managed to meet his repayments . <p> Bendigo CFA senior station officer Darren was the first person on the scene of the fire about 9.30pm , as he was driving past on the Calder Highway with his family . <p> He told the court the fire was in the back of the building , but he had time to retrieve some photographs from the walls before fire brigades arrived . <p> " I think it was two or three boxes of things , photos off the walls , I put them outside , " Mr said . <p> The court was earlier told the fire started in the office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Screenshots from a conversation between Remco Jansen and his friend Nathan Waddington were tendered to court . The conversation showed Mr Waddington told Remco about the fire after seeing posts on Facebook . <p> When he was informed about the fire , Remco Jansen responded : " what bulls--- " , and " really ? ? ?

 <p> Inspector Michael Cruse fell in love with being a detective early on in his career . <p> He joined the Victorian police force straight out of high school and after graduating , spent the next five years stationed at Melbourne suburb Avondale Heights . <p> But during those five years , he spent much of it seconded to other units within the police force , investigating everything from drugs to Asian gangs . <p> " I fell in love with being a detective , to be honest , " he said . <p> " I really loved it . I loved using all of our resources and techniques and , at the time , and even today , the way you investigate is constantly changing with technology . " <p> It was Inspector Cruse 's first taste of being a detective and it was an experience that served him well , as three months ago he took up the lead role overseeing central Victoria 's investigations teams . <p> " This role is the investigations and response manager , so essentially I manage all of our investigative units in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region stretches from Echuca in the north , Gisborne in the south , Maryborough in the west and Rushworth in the east . <p> In Inspector Cruse 's 17-year career , he 's taken up numerous roles within Victoria Police 's crime command , working in both the drug and armed crime taskforces before becoming a detective sergeant at the Echo taskforce , investigating outlaw motorcycle gangs . <p> " I 've loved every minute really . There 's no times when I 've thought about doing anything else , " he said . <p> " Those first few years in the police force were just terrific and really exciting . " <p> Inspector Cruse made the move to Melbourne after growing up on the New South Wales coast at Coffs Harbour . <p> He 's still not sure what originally lead him into the police force , but he applied while still at school after completing work experience at the local station . <p> " I 've thought about it in the past but I actually ca n't really remember why it was the case , but it just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cruse 's most memorable cases was when he was at the armed crime taskforce . <p> A man and a woman had committed a series of armed robberies across Melbourne 's western suburbs and Inspector Cruse said it was a challenging case . <p> " They 'd done five or six and we had no idea who they were , " he said . <p> " And so there was some pressures coming because we were n't solving these crimes . " <p> Eventually the team was able to solve the case , catching the criminals " red-handed " attempting another armed robbery in Richmond . <p> " That brought the case to an end but it was a lot of hard work for a number of weeks and months , " Inspector Cruse said . <p> " I still look at those moments . At the time we were working with a really great team , which has been my experience throughout most of my career . " <p> Inspector Cruse 's 17 years in the police force has also involved time at the organisation 's Professional Standards Command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " If a door opens , then I think you gain more by walking through it than not , " says Inspector Cruse of his philosophy in accepting new challenges in the force . <p> Last year , he made the choice to step up into an inspector role , upgrading at Geelong with a desire to influence positive change within Victoria Police . <p> He secured the investigations role at Bendigo in June , which was originally paired with tasking co-ordination but became too big of a job for one person . <p> So three months ago , Inspector Cruse took up the position and he describes it as a straight management role . <p> " I manage all of the investigations , so as the investigation comes in , sometimes we talk about how an investigations progressing , I approve search warrants , allocate investigations , " he said . <p> " For instance if you 've got an area where there 's a spate of crimes happening then I need to move people into those areas so we can essentially reduce or stop the crimes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played out as soon as Inspector Cruse arrived , with a spate of high volume crimes in Campaspe . <p> More police were sent to the region to help catch the offenders and reduce the crimes through the Crime Crackdown . <p> Inspector Cruse said going forward , he would like to see more proactivity in their response . <p> " What I 'd like to see is utilising lots of our stakeholders and partners to have a bit of a holistic , proactive response to offenders , " he said . <p> " So we essentially prevent the crime before it occurs , rather than investigating it after it occurs , which in my mind is always more efficient and effective and significantly reduces the harm . " <p> Community forums and a youth summit are high on the list of things Inspector Cruse would like to implement during his time in the region and he encouraged the community to play a role in reducing crime . <p> " Truthfully witnesses coming forward and people telling us what 's occurring in their community is still in my belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I 'd ask them if they could report anything they see that is suspicious that is definitely going to help us in the future .

 <h> Bendigo trains delayed at stations <p> Trains stopping at stations too long is one of the main reasons behind delays on the Bendigo line , according to the regional public transport operator . <p> V/Line released its August performance results this week , showing 86 per cent of Bendigo services arrived on time during the month . <p> The figure is the highest the line has recorded in three months , however , it is marginally lower than the previous year 's August figure of 86.5 per cent . <p> V/Line chief executive James Pinder said 700 of the 816 Bendigo line trains that operated in August arrived at their destination on time . <p> " This is the highest punctuality result since May , which is really good to see , " he said . <p> In terms of reliability , the Bendigo line reported its best month this year , with 98.4 per cent of services being delivered , and highest figure since November last year . <p> Like punctuality , the August 2017 figure for reliability is marginally below what is was in August 2016 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Pinder said one of the main reasons for delays on the Bendigo line in August was some trains stopping at stations longer than scheduled to allow passengers time to board and depart their service . <p> " There 's a lot of work going on to improve dwell times at stations , " he said . <p> " This includes station announcements from staff to encourage passengers to spread out along the platform and use all available doors when boarding to help ensure a train departs on time . " <p> Mr Pinder said an extra 18 services on the Bendigo line introduced at the end of August would help meet demand and address the growing patronage , as would the regional rail revival program . <p> The program will see $91 million spent on upgrades to the Bendigo line and provide an additional daily service to Echuca -- where only 73.8 per cent of services arrived on time in August . <p> The figure is a big jump from the previous month , when just 46.1 per cent of services arrived on time on the Echuca and Swan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of services were delivered . <p> Across the V/Line network , on-time performance increased for the third consecutive month to its highest level since October last year , with 85.2 per cent of trains arriving at their destination on time . <p> " On-time performance across the network has been a big focus so it 's really pleasing to see punctuality at its highest level in 10 months and we will be working to ensure this continues , " Mr Pinder said . <p> Reliability of services remained constant , with 98.4 per cent of services delivered in August , the same figure for July . 
 <p> The Bulldogs -- playing in their fifth grand final in the past six years -- were outplayed for much of the game by the slicker Bombers as they fell short in their bid to win a hat-trick of premierships for the first time in club history . <p> The Bulldogs , who trailed by as many as 40 points during the last term , were beaten 15.18 ( 108 ) to 12.10 ( 82 ) at Huntly in a game where they were outscored in all four quarters and constantly put under immense pressure by the impressive Bombers . <p> " They were far too good for us today , " Bennett said . <p> " They used the footy a lot better than us around the ground and going into their forward 50 . <p> " They did n't give us any time or space to steady up and hit a target and we just seemed to be under pressure every time we had the footy. 
 <h> Bendigo Advertiser letters to the editor <h> Focus on the issues affecting residents <p> I 'm pleased that council has taken a neutral position on the ' same-sex marriage " issue ; neither voicing an opinion for or against , that 's how it should be . <p> It 's fine for Cr Alden to make any comments she likes as an individual , and I respect her right to do so , however those statements should be reported as being made by an individual not as someone representing the views of the people of Bendigo . <p> As members of a city council , councillors should concentrate their energy on the issues they were elected to be responsible for , by all the people of Bendigo . Unless of course they stated before they were elected that they would be addressing issues of a national importance outside of their jurisdiction , or the mandate they were given by ratepayers . <p> They should concentrate on issues they were elected to deal with and have direct control over , matters such as footpaths damaged and made unsafe for residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk around Bendigo and of course the issue of the re-supply of bags for the green compost bins which was a great initiative . <p> Unfortunately to date this initiative has failed , because despite a press release some months ago of more bags being delivered to residents this has not eventuated . We were assured during two visits in four weeks to council offices the problem was being address , sadly this is not the case . <p> Sorry councillors but these are just examples of some of the issues you were elected to deal with , we already pay more than enough for others elected to deal with issues of a national or state importance , and as individuals you have the right to join them . Until you make that choice I suggest that you all stick to your job description . <h> David Arscott , Kangaroo Flat <h> Retain foundations <p> In 1947 Winston Churchill said ( quoting an unknown predecessor ) : " Democracy is the worst form of government , except for all the others . " Someone else has said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is nearly always wrong ! " <p> Both statements are relevant to the debate about same-sex marriage . We need to be well informed with reliable information from well-documented sources , rather than from the results of random surveys and vested interests . In the past , the gay community has been poorly treated by some , but now , causes are being promoted that could well harm the very fabric of society in the future . <p> In 2008 , 85 laws were amended by the federal parliament , removing legal discrimination against gay men , lesbians and same-sex couples . <p> As far as benefits are concerned , legally there is no difference between same-sex couples , other de facto couples or married couples in such things as taxation , superannuation , Medicare , DVA spouse pension , next of kin , etc . <p> One of the main purposes of marriage , by the joining of a man and a woman , is the opportunity to produce children . It is a well-known and scientifically established fact , through decades of research , that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married biological parents . Hence the need to encourage , strengthen and support this . <p> As we prepare to vote on the question of same-sex marriage and its effects on our society , it is important that we act compassionately and respectfully and in a well-informed way , whilst retaining solid foundations .
