In this article we look to simplify them , so you can hold your own when you are at the local DIY store ! <h> Thermal Conductivity of insulating materials <p> Thermal conductivity , also known as Lambda ( denoted by the greek symbol ++ ) , is the measure of how easily heat flows through a specific type of material , - independent- of the thickness of the material in question . <p> The lower the thermal conductivity of a material , the better the thermal performance ( i.e. the slower heat will move across a material ) . <p> It is measured in Watts per Metre Kelvin ( W/mK ) . <p> To allow you to get a feel of insulating materials " their thermal conductivity varies between about 0.008 W/mK for vacuum insulated panels ( so these are the best , but very expensive ! ) to about 0.061 W/mK for some types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep 's wool to insulate you property this comes in about 0.034 W/mK , about the same as most of the other wool and fibre insulating materials . <h> R-Values <p> The R-value is a measure of resistance to heat flow through a given thickness of material . So the higher the R-value , the more thermal resistance the material has and therefore the better its insulating properties . <p> If you were to insulate a solid brick wall , you simply find the R-value of the insulation and then add the two together. - If you insulated this with 80mm thick foil-faced polyisocyanurate ( with- thermal conductivity ++=0.022W/mK and R-value of 0.08 / 0.022 = 3.64 m2K/W ) , you would have a total R-value for the insulated wall of 0.18 + 3.64 = 3.82 m2K/W . Therefore it would- improve the thermal resistance by more than 21 times ! <p> The R-value is therefore a relatively simple way to compare two insulating materials if you have the thermal conductivity for each material. - It also allows you to see the impact of adding thicker layers of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up of many different material layers. - The total thermal resistance- of the entire wall is- calculated by adding the thermal resistance of each separate layer . <p> Unfortunately heat moves in and out of your home in several different- ways- and R-values only take into account conduction . It does not include either convection or radiation . <p> Therefore you may choose to use the U-value which takes into account all the different mechanisms of heat loss read on to find out how this is calculated ! <h> U-Values <p> The U value of a building element is the inverse of the total thermal resistance of that element. - The U-value is a measure of how much heat is lost through a given thickness of a particular material , but includes the three major ways in which heat loss occurs conduction , convection and radiation . <p> The environmental temperatures inside and outside a building play- an important role when calculating the U-value of an element. - If we imagine the inside surface of a 1 m- section of an external wall of a heated building in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiation from all parts of the inside the building- and- by convection from the air inside the building .

We have scoured the can find one of these tradesmen on our easy to use local installer map . <h> 24 comments <p> I 'll admit straight off that I did n't  try to do the math on this , definitely not my forte . I was simply trying to get a feel for how much more efficient a .25 U window is compare to a .28 U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient window but does it make sense to keep pushing downward . On my current project the .25 U window package comes out to roughly $3K more . Is it possible to calculate the time to pay off additional cost ? I 'm guessing ( emphasize guessing ) that it would take over 50 years . <p> Be aware that there are metric and imperial U and R values , which is why you ( imperial ) are getting 0.3 whereas me Im getting 0.7 <p> The biggest difference Ive seen is warmth of the room . If you have large amounts of glass and the rest is well insulated the window areas become a cold zone . You also need to realise that the people in the room generate heat ! What you can do is get close to a passive house , in that the heating is n't on but the house stays warm . <p> As to payback timescales , that has to be done on a house-by-house basis . There are a large number of factors ( inc. outside temp/inside temp/occupancy profile/occupancy load/other insulation ) that determine payback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the property ? As you do n't  want to replace the windows every 5 years . <p> I was also confused doing the R calculation . 1 . The wall is 220 mm thick . 2 . I also misread that R was the reciprocal of Lambda . It was not a 1 , but L/R where L= thickness of the wall . 3 . The " extra " M arrives when you use L ( in metres ) not a simple 1 ; so R = L ( m ) / ( W/mK ) = m2K/W . This is also for one square metre for one degree K temperture difference , so if you had a wall 150m2 , you would have to multiply R by 150 and also the temperatue difference between inside and out . ( I might be wrong , so please check ! ) <p> I understand you explanation , but , our produces are 250mmx150mmx80mm , so yes we can calculate the 80mm thickness but the end results is per square meter our product is 375 square cms would it be correct to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little underwhelmed by the figures in the first example that concluded that 80mm of PIR insulation would only double the insulation properties of a solid brick wall . <p> I think the measurement for the insulation was incorrectly specified as 8mm , ( 0.008m ) so should this calculation not read ; ( with an R-value of 0.08 / 0.022 = 3.63 m2K/W ) , Total = 3.63 + 0.29 = 3.92 m2K/W thus improving the insulation of the 220mm brick wall by a factor of 13 ?

Good lighting makes people feel both mentally and physically better so it is worth getting right ! <h> What determines the type of light produced by a lamp ? <p> The light produced from a lamp is dependant on three things : colour temperature , colour rendering and lumen output . <h> Colour temperature <p> Different types of light bulb tend to produce different colours of light . For example , a traditional incandescent bulb tends to glow a warm yellow colour , while a strip light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The colour of light produced by a bulb is known as the colour temperature or more correctly , the correlated colour temperature ( CCT ) . <p> The best way to envisage this is to imagine heating a piece of iron . Initially it will be a dark dull colour , but as you heat it , it will begin to glow orange and as you take the temperature up even further it becomes a brighter white . The CCT refers to the colour at a particular temperature , so the hotter the temperature the brighter ( and whiter ) the light colour . <p> Now , the CCT is actually determined from the colour changes of a black body radiator ' as it is heated " but obviously the piece of iron is a much easier concept to get your head around ! <p> So the colour temperature is simply a numerical value assigned to the colour emitted from a light source depending on the temperature ( measured in degrees Kelvin ) . In the chart on the right , you can see examples of different types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chart is used just to illustrate the point ; different bulbs can operate at slightly different colour temperatures , but this can certainly be used as a guide . <p> Typically , we refer to low colour temperature as being warm in appearance , while high colour temperature is referred to as cool in appearance . If you consider your home , it is likely to be dominated by warm light " halogen GU10 spotlights and traditional incandescent bulbs , conversely offices tend to be lit by more cold light , including things like fluorescent tubes . <h> Colour rendering <p> Colour rendering is the ability of a light source to give good colour representation of the colour it is illuminating . It is measured on a scale of Ra 0 " 100 ( Ra is sometimes replaced with CRI ) . Ra 100 is considered the best and this is equivalent to the rendering provided by daylight , hence many work places are now using daylighting as a matter of course . <p> The European Union 's standard for workplace lighting ( EN 12464-1:2011 ) dictates that lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously no such standard for the home , but the higher the Ra number , the- more vivid and lively representation of the object being illuminated . It is possible to get lights with Ra 90+ but as you might expect , the bulbs will cost considerably more . <h> Lumen output <p> The lumen is a unit of measurement for the brightness of light . A bulb with a higher number of lumens will produce a brighter light , while fewer lumens results in a dimmer light . <p> In the past , consumers relied on watts to get a feel for the brightness of a bulb . A 100w incandescent bulb is far brighter than a 40w bulb , for example . However since the advent of low energy lighting , comparing wattage just is n't feasible since a 5w LED might produce the same number of lumens as an equivalent 40w incandescent bulb . <p> In the table on the right , you can see a list of typical bulbs and their relative luminous efficiency " which is simply the lumens you can expect per watt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the best . <p> When replacing your existing bulbs with new LEDs , we recommend using the lumen as a comparison , to ensure your new LED bulbs have a similar level of brightness . <h> Lux " measuring the intensity of light <p> Remember that the lumen is a unit of measurement for the brightness of light . <p> Regardless of how bright a light is , if you are a long way from it , it will- provide less light intensity than if you stood- right next to it . <p> Lux is the measure of the apparent intensity of light hitting or passing through a surface at a given distance . A light source 1 metre away will appear far brighter than the same light source from 100 metres way . <p> 1 lux is equal to 1 lumen per square metre , so if you have 1000 lumens concentrated on an area of 1m2 then the area will be light up with an illuminance of 1000 lux . <p> If you had the same 1000 lumen bulb concentrated on an area of 10m2 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be 100 lux . <h> What this all means for the lighting in your- home <p> In the majority of cases , we recommend going for a bulb with a colour temperature of between 2,700k and 4,200k . This is the equivalent to a more traditional incandescent or halogen bulb . <p> Having said all that , the colour temperature of the lighting you opt for is a very personal preference , but we do recommend trying a few different bulbs to see which- you prefer before investing in a whole load of them . <p> One thing that you do need to ensure is that you opt for the same colour temperature in each area . This means that when you bulk-buy bulbs for a targeted area they are the same colour temperature and ideally the same bulb ( this will ensure they have the same lifespan which can reduce maintenance costs ) . <p> In terms of colour rendering , as mentioned , bulbs that have a higher colour-rendering figure will cost more .

@@36748734 @5748734/ <h> Conduction , Convection and Radiation <h> June 2 , 2014 <p> In this blog , we are going to look at the various ways heat can be transferred and what that means for both heating and insulation . <h> Convection Heating <p> Radiators and storage heaters are two of the most common heating systems in the UK and they both take advantage of convection to heat spaces . When a radiator gets warm , it heats the air that comes into direct contact with it , which causes the air to increase in temperature <p> As the air gets warm , it expands and becomes less dense which causes it to rise upwards . As it rises , cool air is pulled to the radiator to replace it , which then in turn gets warmed too . The warm air in the room cools naturally as it transfers its heat when it hits cooler objects and therefore the cycle repeats itself in what is known as a convection cycle . <p> Advantages of convection heating : <p> Moves air around the room <p> Relatively cheap because it works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Can push dust around the home , exacerbating allergies . <p> Heats the air , which means opening a window will lose heat much more quickly than radiant heat . <h> Radiant Heating <p> Radiant heaters use radiation to heat surfaces . Unlike convection heaters that heat the air , radiant heaters ( or infrared heaters ) emit infrared radiation , which travels unimpeded until it hits a solid object which absorbs the radiation and warms up . The best example of radiant heating is the sun " this is why even on a cold winters day , you can still feel the warmth of the sun on your face . <p> A photo of a white glass infrared heating panel . <p> Once the objects warm up as a result of the radiant heating , they gently give off their heat to the surrounding air .

This is where the molecules pass on their energy directly from one to another . Generally gasses are really bad conductors , so it is not possible to heat a room using conduction alone .

Convection can be reduced by preventing the exchange of air between the inside and outside of the home " best achieved by draught proofing and ensuring the home is as air tight as possible . <p> Conduction can be reduced by placing insulating materials as a barrier between the inside and outside . Fibre , wool and foam insulation work by trapping pockets of air in their layers ( gasses being poor conductors ) " This cuts any convection that might occur and prevents the conduction of heat from one side to the other . Rigid , solid insulation like Celotex relies on the material itself to prevent the heat transfer " but can be similarly effective . <p> Double glazing is more efficient than single glazing because of that vacuum between the panes of glass " it prevents the conduction of heat because vacuums have no molecules with which to transfer the heat from one side to the other . 
@@36748735 @5748735/ <h> What is the difference between cavity wall insulation and solid wall insulation ? <h> April 24 , 2015 <p> This can be a little confusing , so let 's take a look at the two main types of insulation for your walls and when they are applicable . <h> What is a cavity wall ? <p> Cavity walls were developed in the first half of the 20th century as a way to alleviate damp . Very simply , instead of having a 9 inch thick brick wall between the inside and outside of the house , a cavity wall has two layers of brick , with a gap in between . The gap can be anything from 20 to 100mm wide and therefore means that cavity walls tend to be much wider than a solid brick wall . <p> You can tell if your property is a cavity wall by looking at any exposed brickwork . If all the bricks are of even length ( i.e. they have all been laid lengthways ) you probably have a cavity wall . You can also look at the width of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you have a cavity wall . <h> What is cavity wall insulation ? <p> Cavity wall insulation is fairly cheap to install and only takes a few hours on an average house . The gap between the bricks is filled with one of several different materials at a cost of around -5-8 per square meter . It is cheap , easy to install and will save you plenty on your bills . Most properties in the country that are able to install this form of insulation have already had it done . <p> There are a few different types of cavity insulation . Modern properties will be built with insulation already in place , usually rigid board insulation . When insulation is retrofitted for an older property , the options are the cheaper fibre glass type insulation , or polystyrene bead insulation , which is more expensive but has a higher performance . There are ECO grants available for cavity wall insulation , so you usually will get the work heavily subsidised , if not free . <h> What is a solid wall ? <p> A solid brick wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with each row of bricks interlocking to form a completely solid 9 inch brick wall . There is no gap between the bricks to insulate , and so you must either add insulation to the inside of the property , or do so externally . <p> These sorts of walls can be identified by looking at the brickwork again . If the bricks alternate between a mixture of header ( short ) and stretcher ( long ) bricks , you have a solid wall . If the property is rendered , check the width of the wall " if it is less than 260mm , chances are that the wall is solid brick . The vast majority of properties built prior to the 30s will be solid brick . <h> What is solid wall insulation ? <p> Whether you choose to insulate internally or externally , solid wall insulation is expensive . There is some funding available for this form of insulation , but you will probably have to make a contribution of your own in the realm of thousands rather than hundreds of pounds . <p> A photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Insulating a typical solid wall makes an even bigger difference to a property than cavity wall insulation , with a typical semi detached property seeing a saving of -300 on their bill , or around 25% of a home 's heating bill . That is some serious money savings ! <h> What is the cost difference ? <p> Many people get a shock when they hear the cost of solid wall insulation . It is a very labour intensive , material rich job that takes weeks rather than hours to properly install . Cavity wall insulation can be done in a few hours on an equivalent property , and the cost is an order of magnitude lower . -5-8 per square meter for cavity wall compared to -100 per square meter for solid wall insulation .

@@36748736 @5748736/ <h> Is Concrete bad for the environment ? <p> First off , I would like to apologise this subject really is very dry , I have tried to make the blog below interesting , but it was a struggle and so you might want to grab a strong coffee before you get started ! <p> So here goes .. <p> Concrete is the most widely used building material today as a result of its strength and its durability . It is used in homes , airports , skyscrapers , tunnels and pretty much every other type of construction you can think of . <p> Concrete and cement are terms that are often used interchangeably , however cement is actually an ingredient that makes up concrete , along with water , sand and gravel . Cement acts as a hydraulic binding material , hardening with water and tying together all the aggregate materials . <h> Why is Concrete a Problem ? <p> After coal-powered electricity , cement manufacture is the next biggest emitter of greenhouse gases , accounting for approximately 5% of annual anthropogenic global CO2 production . In 2011 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the construction industry the problem being that for every tonne of cement produced , one tonne of CO2 is also produced . <p> I am not going to try to use this blog as a platform to preach that we should stop building that would be ridiculous . People need a place to live and businesses need to grow . However , I am going to look at the current manufacturing processes and identify a few technologies and areas of investigation that are being toyed with to reduce the impact of the cement / concrete industry and the impact it has on anthropogenic CO2 emissions . <h> How is Cement Made ? <p> First a bit of science ! To make cement , limestone ( calcium carbonate " CaCO3 ) is heated to temperatures approaching 10000C , along with other feedstock materials such as clay ( which contains silicates ) . At this temperature , the limestone ( and other feedstock ) breaks down into Calcium Oxide ( known as Lime CaO ) , Silicon Oxides and Carbon dioxide . The two oxides then combine to produce di &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder producing a product known as clinker ' . <p> Finally Gypsum is added to the clinker ( to prevent flash setting of the cement ) , and this is ground to produce the cement , which can then be used as the main ingredient to make concrete . <p> There are two ways that making cement releases CO2 : <p> Burning fossil fuels to heat the kilns to achieve the reaction temperatures <p> Breaking down calcium carbonate into calcium oxide and CO2 <p> The burning of the fossil fuels accounts for about- 30% of the total CO2 , while breaking down the calcium carbonate accounts for 70% <h> Processes to Make Cement Manufacture Greener ' <p> So how can you make greener ' cement , thereby helping to reduce the total volume of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere ? <h> Carbon Sequestration <p> Well strictly , the first couple of processes I touch upon are not related to changing the manufacturing process , but instead installing carbon sequestration techniques , thereby using the CO2 rich flue gasses to produce new materials . <p> As covered across TheGreenAge , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products . Artificial photosynthesis would use this gas to produce sugars that are essentially a store of energy , replicating the natural process that plants use for growth everyday . The benefit of this technique would be not only limiting CO2 emissions , but also producing a valuable by-product . <p> Bio-algal synthesis is another technique for using the CO2 ; in this process the gas is pumped through a waste water growth medium infused with microalgae . These algae use sunlight and the CO2 for growth , doubling their mass every 24 hours , which can eventually be crushed for algae oil and algae meal for cattle . The advantage of the algae meal is that there is little cellulose within it ( unlike regular crop derived meal ) , so when digested by cattle , very little methane is produced ( another greenhouse gas ) , helping to solve another greenhouse gas emitting problem . <p> In terms of changes to the process itself , there are numerous different ways that it could be carried out to produce lower carbon dioxide emissions . <h> Using Electrolysis to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , replacing the initial kiln part of the reaction , different resulting molecules would be produced . <p> If carried out over 8000C , electrolysis would produce lime in addition to carbon and an oxygen molecule . If it is carried out under 8000C , the Lime is produced along with carbon monoxide and an oxygen atom . Carbon monoxide can be used to produce fuel and form plastics , and has a value of approximately $600 / tonne , allowing one to actually make money from the process ( based on the lower cost to produce the lime ) . <h> Make Extra Strong Concrete , Need to Use Less ! <p> This is a fairly simple idea , but by changing the feedstock entering the initial furnace , you can change the chemical composition of the clinker. - So why not make extra strong ' concrete , so you do n't need to use as much to perform the same job . Placticisers are additives that are added to the concrete that increase its strength . They are relatively complex but essentially to get strong concrete you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These placticisers act as spacers between the cement molecules , ensuring that there is less water in contact with these molecules , hence stronger concrete . <h> Use Solar Power <p> The kilns used in the current process ( to heat the clay and limestone ) need to reach incredibly high temperatures . Historically , these temperatures have been reached by using the heat from burning fossil fuels ( accounting for 30% of the carbon dioxide emissions from the cement manufacturing process ) . If the kilns were instead heated using a green electricity source , for example a concentrated solar power plant , this would obviously instantly remove much of the CO2 produced in the process . <h> Use Consistent mixes to make the concrete <p> Currently under EU standards there are 170 different types of concrete mix used in the construction industry . This poses a problem for builders , who simply do not know the strength of the different types , so in order to make sure ' the construction is strong enough , excess concrete is used. - If there were only say 10 types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the characteristics of each one , and they would be able to predict accurately how much of that particular type to use , thereby using less in the overall construction process . <h> Actually redefining the Ingredients That Make Up Concrete <p> There are numerous companies at the moment looking at creating a new concrete altogether . Instead of relying on limestone for the source of lime , research startups are trying to harness other techniques . <p> Novacem , a startup based in Imperial College , is looking to replace limestone with Magnesium based Silicates , current prototypes are beginning to demonstrate strength on par with traditional concrete . <p> Calera , based in California and backed by Vinod Khosla , is looking to use the flue gases of other high CO2 emitting industries to make the cement . <p> Louisiana Tech is looking to do away with limestone too , by creating a paste from fly ash ( bits of non combustible fuel thrown out of the flue with exhaust gases ) , sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide . <p> As a $170bn industry , it is clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have started popping up have decided to spend the time and financial resources to try to come up with a greener concrete , that could one day replace the traditional concrete . <h> The Future of Concrete <p> China currently use about half of the world 's supply of cement , and this demand is expected to rise by an additional 700,000 tonnes over the next 5 years . If current production techniques are used , an equivalent 700,000 tonnes of CO2 will enter the atmosphere . <p> This is just China though ; hopefully in the next couple of years the worlds economies will be able to put the current financial situation behind them , and begin a new phase of growth . As a result , global demand for concrete is only going to rise , therefore we really need to come up with a way to lessen the impact of the concrete industry on the environment , potentially using one of the methods detailed above . <h> 8 comments <p> Thanks for explanation .

It 's interesting , because we have a real problem with the cost of heating our homes in the UK , so why are other countries so different ? <h> What do we use to heat our homes ? <p> In the US , around 50% of properties are heated with natural gas , whilst around a third are heated with electricity . There are also a smaller percentage of oil and biomass , making up 12% of the market . Only 15% of the UK does not have access to mains gas , which means the UK has a much higher level of grid connected homes . Most homes on the gas grid utilise gas boilers with a central heating system , whilst most off grid homes use electricity . <p> These figures are n't particularly different , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating . This shows a drastic difference , with the vast majority of US homes being heated with a warm air system of some kind . Whether the method is a gas or oil fired furnace , heating air which is pumped around the house , or if it is an electric air source heat pump , converting electricity to warm air and ducting that around the house , the most common method of heating in the States is a ducted warm air system . <p> The UK is of course very different . Whilst offices might use ducted heating , the vast majority of homes use a boiler heating water , which is then moved around the house to heat radiators . There are obviously exceptions , but it is interesting to see such a huge disparity between two modern western countries . <h> How much do utilities cost ? <p> The first clue as to why someone would choose one heating method over another is the cost of fuel . The two key ones in the UK are electricity and natural gas . <p> UK <p> US <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $0.074/kwh <p> $0.032/kwh <p> All this tells us however is that the US has cheaper fuel . Electricity and gas are both around half the price in the US , and this on its own does not really give us an idea as to why one method predominates . <h> More off-grid properties <p> The US is a big country , with a lot of smaller rural communities dotted across the map . This means that there is a smaller percentage of properties on the gas grid when compared to the UK . It therefore follows that there will be more off grid properties , and more properties using de-centralised heating methods , like biomass for example . With less properties on the gas grid , it makes sense that there will be slightly more homes heating with electricity , because the electricity grid is much more extensive . <h> Big temperature differences <p> America is a country of temperature extremes , both regionally and seasonally . Big seasonal variations mean that having a heating system that can also cool the property is going to be a big advantage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the summer they can be used to cool . Heat pumps are really efficient at doing this , so you will find that in the warmer parts of the US , these sorts of system are commonplace . <p> In cooler parts of the US , in some of the northern states , heat pumps just wo n't work in winter , at least not in any reasonable efficiency . Temperatures can reach -20 degrees or more , and at this sort of temperature heat pumps are really inefficient . <p> Here , a warm air furnace is preferred , utilising either gas , oil or wood . These are good ways to heat the home in cold climates because of the high temperatures at which they operate . <h> Space requirements <p> Space is at a premium in the UK . Especially in towns , every square meter costs a small fortune , so it is really in our interest to keep heating systems as small as possible . This means compact combi boilers , and slimline electric heaters . <p> Whilst this is also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in suburban areas , homes tend to be more spaced out , and therefore have plenty of room for the heating system . Homes have room for ducting and big furnace heating systems . There is also more space to store biomass fuel and oil , which contributes to more than 1 in 9 US homes using wood or oil fuel . <h> US vs . UK <p> So there are some key things to come out of this . In the States we see a slightly more decentralised system , leading to more wood and oil fuel use , a greater use of warm air heating and many more heat pumps than in the UK . Over on our side of the pond , we see a predominantly gas boiler and static electric heating systems , focussing on space restrictions and heating rather than cooling . 
@@36748738 @5748738/ <h> Multipoint and single point hot water heaters <h> August 17 , 2015 <p> Although carrying a different name , these heaters are effectively boilers . The only difference is that boilers heat the central heating , and usually the hot water for your taps too , whilst the multipoint heater will just provide hot water for your taps and your shower at best . Single point heaters just provide heat for a single tap in the home . The gas version looks very similar to a gas boiler , whilst the electric version is generally smaller and works in a similar way to your electric shower unit . <h> How efficient are these multipoint heaters ? <p> The answer to this really depends on the age of the unit and the power source . You will find both electric and gas operating heaters , and as you will find with boilers , electric heaters are 100% efficient , whilst gas heaters will vary from 60% all the way up to 90% or so . Once again , the price of the fuel will mean that gas water heaters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> What are the advantages of multipoint heaters over a conventional combi ? <p> Let 's assume that the fuel is the same , why would you go for a multipoint heater over a combi ? There are a few reasons that spring to mind : <p> Although the cost of the boiler itself is very similar , the cost of installing central heating is very high , and it will be much cheaper just to run pipes to the taps that might need hot water than to plumb in radiators as well . <p> You may wish to install a water heater in a part of the home that does not need central heating , but does need hot water . This could be an annex or workshop for example . <p> If you are off gas grid , a multi point heater combined with a dry central heating system is going to be much more cost effective than an electric boiler and a wet central heating system . <h> What are the disadvantages ? <p> There are some obvious problems with installing one of these heaters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls , so you are sometimes in the situation where the water is scalding hot going into the sink , when you only need it warm . So the efficiency of the heater may be high , but if the heat is unnecessary , then there is a lot of wastage . Modern heaters with good controls will negate this . <p> Another disadvantage is that having a split system if you like " where hot water is controlled by one system and the heating controlled by another , is going to be less efficient than having one system controlling everything . It is also going to take up more space and could require more maintenance . <h> Do you need a gas safe installer ? <p> If you are working with gas to install a multipoint heater then you will need a gas safe installer to do the job . Of course if you are dealing with an electric water heater you will not need a gas safe engineer . Installing a water heater will be a similar cost to a standard boiler , perhaps a little less . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit for you . <h> How much do they cost ? <p> A gas multipoint heater will cost about -400-500 for the unit . The cost of installation will vary greatly depending on the location and complexity of the job , but the total cost is going to be a bit less than an equivalent boiler install . <h> Is there any funding for water heaters ? <p> Unfortunately there is no green deal or GDHIF funding for this measure . In a similar vein , there is no funding to replace hot water cylinders and the like , only for new central heating boilers . So you will have to fund a water heater yourself ! <h> Do you install multi point heaters ? <p> We can provide a quote to install a multipoint or single point heater for customers in the greater London area .

Insulating this pipework is called lagging- and by sealing in heat , it saves energy and has a number of other benefits too . Here we talk you through reasons for the measure , how it is done and materials you can choose from . <h> What are the dangers of un-insulated water pipes ? <p> There are several reasons to insulate your pipework : <p> Coppers high conductivity- means it is great for transporting hot water- in central heating systems , but just as the pipes get very warm , they can also get too cold . When water freezes , pipes can burst , - potentially leading to expensive repair work . <p> Pipes in cold environments- can attract water vapour when it condenses on the surface , it can lead to corrosion . It can also potentially encourage damp within walls .

You can also see our thoughts on the Conservatives policies . <p> The document sets out 3 key focuses : <p> To ensure security of energy supply and keep the lights on . ' <p> To ensure energy costs are affordable for consumers and businesses . ' <h> Energy policy <p> Labour 's manifesto says what the UK 's energy mix needs and the current government has n't delivered is modernisation and non-polluting alternatives . However , Labour 's policies in regards to energy generation seem pretty muddled . It does acknowledge that energy blackouts are now a very real threat , as- successive governments have been burying their heads in the sand with regards to the UKs waning capacity for energy generation . <p> However , despite stating its commitment to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifesto does n't specify how it will boost energy generation . It talks about the positives of a low-carbon energy sector and mentions banning fracking to diversify away from fossil fuels " but it does n't rule out the use of oil or gas . In fact , it actually talks about protecting North Sea assets ' . <p> One thing Labour and Conservatives agree on is the investing in tidal lagoons , like the one currently planned for Swansea . Their enthusiasm for this technology might well hinge on the technology 's promise as a huge economic export for the UK . <p> Disappointingly , the document completely fails to mention wind or solar at all . This is surprising considering the proven potential of the UK 's renewable sources . <p> The one thing that is clear is that the manifesto is wholly in favour of nuclear energy ; it proudly states that the UK has the world 's oldest nuclear industry ' and vows to support future nuclear projects . <h> Fuel poverty <p> The manifesto- points to the fact that customers are being overcharged on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering from fuel poverty . Labour also states its intention to insulate 4 million homes to fight fuel poverty and help prevent the health problems and winter deaths associated with it . Like Theresa May , Labour proposes introducing an energy fuel cap , limiting the amount suppliers can charge for gas and electricity . This is intended to curb the increasing profits of the big six energy companies , while ensuring that energy is affordable for everyone . One drastic way Labour 's energy policy would differ to that of the Conservatives is its proposed renationalisation of the energy companies . <h> Air pollution <p> The manifesto is predictably damning in in regards to the actions " and inactions of the current Conservative government . It highlights how ministers evaded their responsibilities on air quality , and allowed fracking in national parks . ' The manifesto sets out the intension to establish an environmental tribunal to hear challenges to unlawful government decisions like those made on the - Conservatives ' air quality strategy . <p> One thing foregrounded in the manifesto is Labour 's commitment to tackling the UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms that our air is killing us ' . Its own Sadiq Khan 's has introduced several measures to combat air pollution during his first few months as Mayor of London , and " in theory " most of these could be brought into place nationwide . <h> Other green policies <p> Labour 's broader green policies focus on sustainable farming and fishing , safeguarding marine life and protecting the UK 's forests . It states its intention to plant a million trees of native species to promote biodiversity and better flood management . ' Labour also promises to safeguard ocean species and cut food manufacturing waste . It mentions researching carbon capture and storage , but does n't go into any detail . <h> What do people think of Labours environmental policies ? <p> There has been a pretty mixed reception to this section of the manifesto " and it 's easy to see why . It comes across as a lot of half-baked ideas , mentioned but not expanded on . It certainly does n't go far enough to offer radical change to those for whom green issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Green Party were so keen- to claim a lot of the ideas as their own . <p> There are some good suggestions for combating fuel poverty , and on a lot of emphasis on environmental issues concerning animals and Britain 's green spaces . The subjects of cutting carbon , boosting energy generation and moving to renewables should arguably have got much more attention than they did . <p> The manifesto has some good ideas , but it is also full of contradictions . As Jonathan Bartley succinctly put it , - You ca n't pour money into Hinkley nuclear power plant and create a renewable energy revolution . ' The Labour manifesto does n't offer anything like an energy revolution " but it does have some awareness of the key areas that need improvement .

@@36748741 @5748741/ <h> Coefficient of Performance and Seasonal Performance Factor <h> February 28 , 2014 <p> When it comes to researching heat pumps , you will come across two terms constantly that you need to understand " Coefficient of Performance ( often abbreviated to CoP ) and Seasonal Performance Factor ( abbreviated to SPF ) . <p> Understanding what these terms mean is absolutely key , since they reveal the efficiency of a heat pump . Obviously the more efficient the heat pump the better , since running costs will be lower , but also these values will have a direct impact on the amount you will receive via the renewable heat incentive ! <h> The Coefficient of Performance of Heat Pumps <p> The Coefficient of Performance is a simple ratio of the heating provided by a heat pump to the electricity consumed . <p> In a heat pump , electricity is used to move heat from a cold reservoir to a hot reservoir in a very efficient way . How efficient ? Where an electric heater converts 1kW of electricity into 1kW of heat , a heat pump converts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It is easy to think that this is defying the laws of thermodynamics , but of course the heat from the pump is not being generated , it is simply being shipped from outside the property into the inside . The warmer the external heat source , the better , since there is less electricity required to get it up to a nice temperature . <p> The Coefficient of Performance therefore varies throughout the year " in the winter months , an air source heat pump will require more electricity to get the heat up to a comfortable temperature so the CoP will be relatively low ( perhaps 2.5 ) . In the summer the opposite is true ; since the external temperature of the air is warm already , the heat pump does n't require much electricity to get the heat pump up to a nice temperature , so the CoP might be as high as 4 or more . <p> Now consider a Ground Source heat pump , this takes advantage of heat in the ground and uses a series of buried pipes to absorb the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the year , the CoP will likewise be relatively consistent . <p> Hopefully you can spot a problem with using CoP as the sole measure of heat pump efficiency " since there is massive seasonal variation we need a means of getting an average efficiency of the heat pump over a year , to be able to compare different heat pumps . <h> The Seasonal Performance Factor of Heat Pumps <p> As we have said , the temperature of the ground or air being used by the heat pump plays a key role in the system 's efficiency . The seasonal performance factor takes into account how well the pump works at both low and high temperatures , and is a far better reflector of how efficient your pump will be than the CoP . <p> It allows you to make calculations between different ground , air and even water source heat pumps , which is pretty fundamental since the variation in costs between the different units . For example we quote a guide price of -25,000 for a ground source heat pump , while an air source heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPF of a ground source heat pump could be as high as 4 over the year , while the SPF of an ASHP may be only just over the 2.5 mark . Depending on energy usage , this means that relatively quickly , opting for a GSHP could be a better decision based on energy savings . <p> Likewise , if you look at the calculation for the Renewable Heat Incentive " it takes into account the SPF , rewarding a heat pump that is more efficient through higher payments . You can see how to calculate the RHI here . <h> Good CoP , Bad CoP <p> As we have seen , the performance of a heat pump can vary wildly depending on a number of factors , but generally speaking ground source heat pumps can regularly be found on the market with a COP greater than 4 . Air source heat pumps tend to be less efficient , and a COP over 3 is considered good .

@@36748742 @5748742/ <h> Air Source Heat Pumps Vs . Ground Source heat Pumps <h> January 28 , 2014 <p> Now the- Renewable Heat incentive- has launched , - we - are going to take a look at the key differences between an air source heat pump and a ground source heat pump , to help you make a better informed investment decision ! <h> A bit of background on heat pumps <p> Heat pumps are a fantastic way to create hot water in the home ; they absorb heat from either the air or the ground ( hence air source and ground source heat pump ! ) into a fluid . This fluid then gets compressed which drives up the temperature even further and a heat exchanger then transfers the heat from the liquid to water travelling around your heating system . <p> Electricity is traditionally considered the more expensive way to heat the home " one kWh of electricity costs 15p , while one kWh of gas costs only 4p . The thing with heat pumps though , is that unlike a traditional electric radiator that turns that 1kWh into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1kWh into 3.5 or more units of useful heat . <p> Therefore , electrically run heat pumps are actually a really efficient way to heat the home . However , because the extent of the hot water temperature produced by them is not as much as with a gas boiler , you need to ensure that your home is sufficiently insulated in order for the heat pump 's influence to become maximised . <p> However , if you are satisfied that your property is sufficiently insulated then the next question is , which to go for " a ground source heat pump or an air source heat pump ? <h> Cost of heat pumps <p> While the scientific basis between the two technologies is the same , the cost of having them installed is not ! The cost of an air source heat pump ( without considering underfloor heating ) is approximately -7,500 . A Ground source heat pump on the other hand is -23,000 , with much of the additional cost going on bore hole that needs to be drilled " this could cost as much as -9,000 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your back garden . If you have the space , you can lay the ground source heat pump piping not vertically down , but horizontally within a field , but this obviously requires a lot of space , which brings me nicely on to the next point . <h> Land Requirements of heat pumps <p> Air source heat pump units look very much like air conditioning units that you may have seen on office buildings . The size of the heat pump will be determined by your installer based on your homes heat demand " the bigger the home ( + the less insulated ) , the more heat it is going to require " so the larger the air source heat pump unit . <p> A typical unit might be a metre high by a meter wide with a depth of about half a meter . This will obviously vary greatly between models , but will give you something to work with ! <p> A ground source heat pump requires buried pipes in the garden , so the first consideration is whether or not you have a garden to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vertically , bore holing machinery will need to be able to access the garden . In some cases even this might be a showstopper . Although , as said previously , while laying the pipework horizontally takes up a larger surface area of land , it is a cheaper method . <h> Efficiency of Air Source heat pumps vs . Ground Source Heat Pumps <p> Firstly , consider what time of year you use most hot water in your home " the middle of the winter . It is then that the radiators are on at full whack and you have more hot baths and showers . <p> Secondly consider how a heat pump works " it takes heat from either the air or the ground , which warms a working fluid ' , which in turn gets compressed maximising the potential temperature . <p> Now , the higher the temperature of the air / ground , the easier the heat pump needs to work to get up it up to the required temperature . So in the summer , an air source heat pump will take in warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the heat pump will have to do very little to heat the water to the required temperature . <p> Conversely , consider the winter months , when there is a far higher demand for hot water . At this time of year , the air temperature is far lower , so the air source heat pump will need to work far harder to reach the required temperature . <p> With a GSHP , the pipes are running buried in the ground , where you do n't get the same temperature fluctuations as you do above ground " the ground is fixed at about 100C . This means that during the winter , when the air temperature is cooler and the ASHP will need to be working really hard , a comparative GSHP can provide the same hot water requirements off fewer units of electricity . <h> The Coefficient of Performance of Heat Pumps <p> The coefficient of performance ( CoP ) is the ratio of heat delivered by the heat pump versus the electricity supplied to the compressor , so the bigger the CoP the better . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that for every 3kWh of heat output , 1kWh of electricity is used to drive the heat pump . <p> Now as I have mentioned previously , the heat pump will need to work harder when it is colder , and less hard when it is warmer , so the CoP varies on a daily basis . Therefore , in order to compare different heat pumps it is best to look at the Seasonal Performance Factor , which is defined as the ratio of heat delivered by the heat pump versus the electricity supplied to the compressor over the heating season . <h> The Seasonal Performance Factor of Heat Pumps <p> For an air source heat pump you can assume a typical seasonal performance factor of 2.5 " 2.8 . This takes into account that during the winter , the CoP will fall well below the 2.5 level , but during the summer it might be as high as 4 . <p> For a ground source heat pump you can expect a typical season performance factor of about 4 . That means that across the heating season , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reward of investing in a heat pump " the RHI <p> The Renewable Heat Incentive- has- now launched and has been introduced to reward early adopters of heat pumps with generous financial subsidies . The RHI for heat pumps are calculated by taking into account the heat demand for the property and the seasonal performance factor for that particular heat pump . <p> However the RHI tariff for the GSHP is 18.8p / kWh , while for the ASHP it is just 7.3p / kWh . This is due to the up front cost of an ASHP , -7,500 and a GSHP , -23,000 . <p> They have calculated that so by and large the RHI ( at the initial rates they will be reviewed downward on a quarterly basis ) will cover the cost of the installation . <h> Final Thoughts " Ground Source versus Air Source Heat pumps <p> In summary , heat pumps are a very worthwhile financial investment ( especially when you consider the renewable heat incentive ) , particularly if you do n't have access to mains gas . <p> Whether you opt for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your situation , but to be honest as the technology improves there is very little in it " I guess it really depends on whether you can afford the additional expense of the GSHP for the increased efficiency bearing in mind that the RHI at its current level should largely cover the install cost of both of the- technologies . 184563 @qwx384563 184570 @qwx384570 184567 @qwx384567 184575 @qwx384575 184577 @qwx384577 184572 @qwx384572 <h> 25 comments <p> Can you explain to me how much more does a ground source heat pump cost to an air source heat pump and what in your view makes up the biggest cost differential .

The ground source heat pump stuff would have to be installed outside the mound , and it is very liable for flooding here . Will this damage the equipment sited under the ground ? Many thanks <p> Hi Janice , Thanks for your question . We cant give you a definitive answer here , but when you speak with your installer they will be able to answer this question . Since the heat pump is underground anyway ( and therefore often below the water table ) , it will be a sealed system . You should n't therefore have a problem with flood water . I would not let this put you off considering a heat pump , just talk to your installer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I live in a rural village without mains gas . I currently heat the house and the AGA off oil . The house is over 300 years old ( an therefore not very well insulated ) . Solar would be nice as we have a south facing roof , but it would ruin the cottage period character ( property frontage ) . We have a big garden , but would not want to dig up the whole lawn . We are about to embark on building work and will also update the plumbing system . Our oil tank is corroding and I ideally do n't  want to replace it and get rid of need for oil ( especially because we really struggle to get oil delivered ) . <p> I was thinking of converting the AGA to electric ( which is far more efficient ) Already decided . Get rid of oil Ideally . Change the current storage tank and old water heating tank system maybe to something like a Megaflo . We need to update the system but open to suggestions . Install a wood burner ( but still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiators/hot water ) Install ASH or GSH or we have also considered Combined Heat &amp; Power ( GHP ) ( I cant however find much info on this it seems to be a dead option ) . <p> Can anyone solve my heating and hot water problem but helping me with a solution ? <p> Hi Brad , So based on what you have said , the best ( although biggest financial outlay ) would be to install a ground source heat pump . These run on electricity as I am sure you know , but they are far more effective than conventional electric convection heaters , since they turn each unit of electricity into 4 units of useful heat . <p> Based on the fact you do n't  want to dig up the garden you would need to go with boreholes , the number of boreholes ( and depth ) depends on the heat demand of the property and would need to be determined by the MCS registered installer . <p> The nice thing about this setup , aside from the fact that they are efficient is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which should pretty much cover the cost of installing the unit in the first place . <p> This would negate the need for a wood burner , however these are a nice feature and kick out a lot of heat so might be a nice supplementary heating source on those colder winter nights . <p> The key thing about the heat pumps is that they produce hot water at a far lower temperature than traditional gas boilers so you really need to insulate the house prior to getting this installed . <p> In November the GDHIF scheme is due to relaunch which should ( although yet to be confirmed ) provide some financial assistance to get the solid wall installed if you want to go that route . <p> Obviously this is just an opinion and I have n't seen the property , but it hopefully gives you a starter for 10 ! <p> They are both good makes . Watch out that you get an MCS accredited installer . Both those makes also only allow their heat pumps to be installed by installers who have been on the company training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website to find one . <p> Very good article . Some additional considerations with heatpumps , both ground source and air source , is the flow temperature of the distribution system ; at a minimum you must use low temp radiators circa 55 degrees or the best solution is to use underfloor heating circa 45 degrees . If you design the UFH for heatpumps you can go as low as 35 degrees . The rooms are all still heated to 20 odd degrees . Low flow temp significantly improve heatpump ( seasonal ) COP to between 4 and 5 . Also the way you heat a house with heatpumps is quite different , best results come from operating the heating 24/7 , trickling heat in all the time . This is the main reason that heatpumps only work on properties that are extremely well insulated . If you use solar recharge , pumping spare solar heat down you ground source collector in the summer , you can possibly double you COP . All this means that heat pumps work well on new build but are difficult to retro fit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a ground source system . I have seen 4 bed domestic systems installed for -12,000 for heat pump &amp; collectors . <p> I agree , -23,000 is a little high . We 'd install for somewhere around -15,000 , plus the trenching . Also , the ASHP price there is a little low if you 're going to install a new unvented hot water cylinder as well , which you normally would . <p> Hi Mike , Leah I am not sure I agree , it seems the borehole companies are charging about -7,000 per hole at the minute ( it seems they are cashing in on the popularity of the RHI ) . I agree if you are just digging trenches then getting a heat pump installed is far cheaper but in London , seldom to households have gardens big enough to lay the pipe work horizontally . <p> Pete very interesting .

This payment should cover the total install cost of the heat pump over the 7 years .

I have two GU10s to replace , 8w will get me same brightness . I have four unused GU10 Halogens some years old , so I figure they are free , vs frosted LEDs I would use which are verrry pricey . Analyse your use carefully methinks before splashing out on leds , an 8W LED in 5 years time will be about 20 percent the cost it is now and a better product . <p> Hi Paul , I appreciated your points they all do make sense , but we have obviously had to look at standard usage etc . LED bulbs certainly do cost more than their equivalent Halogens , however the energy savings are pretty dramatic so even you move after 5 years they should more than cover the initial cost of buying the bulb . <p> I fitted non-dimmable 6 watt LED spots around the house replacing 8x 35w halogens and 4 x 50w halogen spots .

B&amp;Q was here I bought them . <p> Hi lee , Thanks for the comment . LED bulbs use 90% less energy than the equivalent halogen spots so it is definitely worth swapping over . The only issues we encounter is when people swap out their MR16 halogen bulbs with LEDs becuase they require an external transformer and these do n't  tend to be compatible with the new LED bulbs so you get flickering . Our advice would always be to swap to GU10 so swap to a new fitting + bulb rather than trying to get the MR16s to work with new LED transformer / drivers . <p> the equivilant of a 50w halogen is a 12w LED not 5w , ( which for those reading means your running costs of it are actually twice as much as stated in this article/table and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hi , that is not entirely true ! ! We have 5w bulbs in the office that are very similiar to a 50w . In fact we also have 7w bulbs and these are much brighter . Obviously the higher the wattage of the bulb used , the higher the electricity usage and the higher the cost , but the figures you have suggested are just not true ! <p> Please correct my arithmetic . 1 kWh is 1 kW over 1 hour . If it existed , a 1kW bulb would use 1 kW in 1 hour . Over 40000 hours it would use 40000 kW . In 40000 hours a 50W bulb uses 1/20th of that = 2000 kWh . So how did you calculate 1250 hours ?

' <p> The answer is it depends ! <p> By leaving your heating on , the boiler will have to work to keep the temperature at a set level , whereas having it come on and off at set times will only heat your home at a given period , however your boiler will need to work harder to heat the house from cold to the required temperature . <h> Is your home well-insulated ? <p> The answer is purely dependant on how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very well insulated , you are better off leaving the heating on at a set temperature , where the thermostat will work with the boiler to maintain the temperature relatively easily , since there is little heat loss occurring . <p> Conversely , if your home is not energy efficient , potentially a Victorian property for example , then you are better off just heating it up for the times when you need it . The majority of people are out during the day , so most people opting for this heating schedule will fire the boiler to come up early in the morning for a couple of hours so the house is nice and comfortable when they wake up , then set it to come on in the late afternoon until they go to bed . <p> It will be more cost effective to heat the home as and when you need it , as any heat you generate will be lost fairly quickly through the walls , so if you try and maintain that warmer temperature all the time , your boiler is going to have work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have the home warm ' all the time , but if you work during the day , it should make things a lot cheaper compared to leaving the boiler on . <h> Do n't take our word for it test it for yourself ! <p> So granted I have cast everyone into two baskets " energy efficient and not energy efficient . The truth of the matter is that you will most likely be somewhere between the two , so which heating method will work for you ? <p> Well there is a simple test you can run at home to see whether you should have the heating on all the time or you should use the programmer so it only fires up a couple of times a day . Basically over the course of two weeks " test each method . You will need to take gas readings to do the test , and also bear in mind that if a sudden cold spell hits then your results will most likely be null and void ! <h> The importance of insulation <p> We seem to touch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . If you live in a well-insulated house you will spend less on your energy bills . <p> If you live in an older solid wall property , cavity wall insulation wont be possible and you will need to insulate either internally or externally . <p> Getting a more efficient boiler can also help lower your bills , along with better heating controls . For example , if you do n't have a thermostat , you will likely be overheating your home when the programmer kicks in . Thermostatic valves on your radiators can also regulate the temperature in rooms and they allow you to stop heating rooms you are n't currently using . <h> 26 comments <p> Hi Carole , when you are on Economy 7 , there are normally 2 immersion elements one linked to the cheaper night time electricity and one linked to the day time ( more expensive ) electricity . The cheaper to run immersion could be on all night as the thermostat on the hot water tank will stop it producing hot water when the required temperature is met , however we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per night and only running the day time immersion when there is an absolute emergency for hot water as this will cost you about 3 times as much to produce hot water at this time . <p> I agree completely with daveM . I.e. You save by switching off . This is just A level physics ( and I have a Cambridge PhD in the subject ) . Test question : do you think that if you were going away for a month you would save by keeping the heating running ? <p> I beg to differ regarding keeping the heating on or switching it off . The sure way to reduce fuel consumption is to reduce the temperature indoors since heat loss is proportional to difference of temperature between indoors and outside . The easy way is to have the heating off at times when that has no effect on comfort e.g. When no one is at home or when everyone is tucked up under their duvets .. The classic question is : would you save by leaving the heating on if you were going away for a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me for a boiler service . He is truly remarkable while working he identified a fault with my three year old Worcester-Bosch Greenstar boiler . This was a potential safety concern ; he gave me appropriate advice .

He put up with difficult working conditions and parking restrictions without complaint . You were right to recommend him and I 'm very glad you did . Finally , a heating engineer whom I feel able to trust . <p> Hi Kim , if it ran 24/7 it would cost approximately 36 pence per hour ( 3kw x 12 pence per kWh ) . To be honest though , they normally have thermostats built in which ensures the heating is not left on all the time , this means you would actually use slightly less . The best thing to do to get an accurate measure of how much electricity that device uses is either use an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed on your property . Once you get this , you can then see the cost of keeping the unit on over that time . The key to getting an accurate reading though is to ensure that you do n't  switch on and off other appliances as you are carrying out the test , as this will obviously impact the amount of energy used too ! <p> For me it was defintely cheaper to turn my heating on and off , basically because if the house is cold in the morning it forces me out of bed ! It bugs the wife and kids , but it then means that our heating comes on at 4 pm , and it tends to warm up pretty quick and it goes off about 10pm . I cant beleive it would be anymore energy-efficient to keep the heating on all the time ? <p> Hi Orto , it is normally only worth doing when the house is incredibly well insulated ( i.e. a new build ) . The reason here is the rate of heat loss is extremely slow , so the boiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . When you consider older properties , they get cold very quickly when the heating is switched off , so for these properties it is normally worth trying to minimise cold draughts entering the house ( by draught proofing ) but actually the heating should only come on as and when it is required to help lower energy usage . <p> We had a guy come fix our radiators because it took almost an hour to heat and he had to bleed it out because there was air in it . He suggested we leave our radiators on at a certain temperature and it will be cheaper so we did that of course . A month goes by and we get our gas bill , it came out to be $256 ! ! ! ! Its not cheap at all to leave it on at all times and we had it set to 62 degrees ! ! ! Do not leave your radiators on ! ! ! <p> This answer is misleading because it is always better to have the heating on only when you need it ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the level of insulation . The short answer is to keep the temperature as low as you can bear ( without being uncomfortable ) and turn it off when you do n't  need it , for example if you are out , or in bed . <p> The correct technical explanation is simple physics ( thermodynamics ) and that is that the heat lost is proportional to the temperature difference between the external and internal temperatures the bigger the difference , the more heat is lost . A well insulated property will lose less heat than a poorly insulated one , so for any given internal and external temperatures , the energy consumed ( and therefore the costs ) will be lower . Leaving the heating on when its not needed maintains a higher temperature difference ( because the internal temperature does not fall ) , so more energy is wasted , even though the heating may have to work harder when its switched back on . <p> Of course that is correct people should only turn their heating on when it is required , however most people are n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who use their thermostat to manage their heating . This is what most people do , it means they do n't  need to be on it since their thermostat wont overheat their homes . The issue is that if you live in an older property which lacks insulation then you will burn through fuel so turning it on and off with a programmer is better . Conversely if you live in a really well insulated house , then leaving your heating on all the time ( but using the thermostat to manage the temperature ) is the best way to go . <p> When I lived in an old house with an oil system , I saved nearly a 1000$ one year leaving it on at 19 C all the time . Then , the next year , I had this idiot downstairs neighbor opening her windows at -30C , the floor would turn icy I moved cause of that imbecile .

@@36748745 @5748745/ <h> Expanded polystyrene and the environment <h> January 31 , 2017 <p> EPS is the most commonly used material in external wall insulation . Whilst Rockwool is sometimes specified , the fact that it needs a greater thickness to achieve the same results and costs more to supply and install means that EPS is used on the vast majority of jobs . <p> However EPS , unlike Rockwool , is an oil-based product and therefore gets its environmental credentials questioned regularly . The fact is , - pretty much all modern building and insulation materials are quite carbon-intensive to produce . Cement , for example , produces huge amounts of CO2 in production . Steel takes huge amounts of energy to manufacture , as do insulating materials like Rockwool and phenolic board . <p> In this blog however , we are going to take a closer look at EPS and the whole cycle from production to disposal " exactly what effect does it have on the environment ? <h> Manufacturing EPS <p> EPS is predominantly air " in fact in the average block around 98% of the space is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived from oil is fed into what is called a pre-expander . This machine heats the mixture to around 100 degrees , which expands the material from densities of 630kg/m3 down to 10-30kg/m3 . This process traps air in the closed-cell structure of the EPS creating a very light product . <p> The material is then matured in silos , which allows the vacuums in the cells to slowly permit air to diffuse into the structure . At this stage the product is simply beads of polystyrene . The final stage is to mould the beads into the required shape " in the case of insulation this is simply large blocks , which can then be cut down into sheets of the necessary thickness . <p> In making EPS , there is very little waste generated . Energy usually comes from a conventional gas boiler and water used in the process is recycled . The main environmental impact at this stage will be from the original ingredients . <h> EPS and your wall <p> EPS insulation on your wall is extremely inert . It will react very minimally in response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed to the elements , but it also has fantastic insulating properties , making it one of the best products to use for insulating a property it requires around 20% less thickness to achieve the same performance levels as spun glass wool or fibre insulation . <p> Furthermore it is a great product to work with . It is really easy to shape and cut , lightweight and easy to move around the site . It does not absorb water , making it good as a moisture barrier and it is compatible with nearly all other construction materials because of its inert nature . <h> Disposal of EPS " Recycling and Landfill <p> EPS is a very visual product . It is the first thing that gets spotted in pictures of landfill . But in actuality , a lot of EPS is recycled . It is a relatively easy product to recycle , it is just very low in value , which is why some recycling centres do n't take it " it is not profitable to recycle . That said , if you want your EPS to be recycled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is recycled , it often does end up in landfill , and one of the big problems with this is that it is so bulky . EPS only takes up 1% of the weight in landfill , but the volume of landfill is much higher than this . There is also some evidence that styrene , one of the constituents of EPS , is a human carcinogen ; it is important that the EPS is either recycled , or that the landfill is contained and not allowed to reach streams and waterways where it might be ingested by animals . These chemicals concentrate as they work their way up the food chain , so humans are going to be at risk if the EPS is allowed to move into the wider environment . <p> So , in conclusion , to minimise damage to the environment , EPS should be recycled . EPS is 100% recyclable , so there is no reason not to do so and ensure that as little as possible is sent to landfill . 
@@36748746 @5748746/ <h> Introduction to heating controls <h> Heating <h> What are heating controls ? <p> Heating controls allow you to easily regulate the temperature of your home . The controls automatically turn the heating on and- off based on settings input by the user , to ensure maximum comfort . This process moves away from a fixed , traditional timer system and can therefore be used to better control the temperature within your home . <p> Thermostats , allowing people to control the temperature of their home , have been around for a long time . Newer heating- control systems have evolved to the give residents total control of their heating , and by extension , their bills . The latest technology allows you to automatically control your heating to work- around your daily schedule . <h> Products that make up a- heating control system <p> There are four products that normally make up a full heating control system ( based on a home with a traditional central heating system ) : <p> A room thermostat <p> A boiler programmer <p> A hot water cylinder thermostat <p> Thermostatic radiator valves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or two of these . <h> Room thermostat <p> Room thermostats take the temperature of the ambient air in the home and feed it back to the boiler to tell it to either fire up to raise- the temperature of the home , or to turn off since the home is warm enough and no additional heating is required . <p> They require free-flowing air so that the sensor can work out the right temperature . You 'll need to ensure that the thermostats are not blocked by household objects like curtains or furniture and avoid placing them near heat-emitting objects ( fireplaces , radiators , household appliances etc ) . It is also recommended to house these in the lounge , since this is where homeowners typically spend most of their time . Having your thermostat in the hallway by your front door , for example , will not give an accurate reflection of the temperature of your home . This is because its an area commonly affected by draughts , when the front door is opened and closed . <h> Boiler programmers <p> A boiler programmer is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People tend to like their homes to be warm when they wake up or come home from work . There seems little point in heating the home when no-one is there to get the benefit from the heat . A programmer allows you to set very specific time frames for when the heating comes on from day to day . <p> Let 's take the example of- a family that go- to school/work during the day . Typically the boiler would come on at approximately 6-7am to heat the house ready for when the family wakes up . This would then go off at about 9 when the people in the home leave for work or school . The boiler could then fire up again about 4pm in preparation for everyone coming home and go off just before everyone goes to bed . <p> These programmers allow you to set different heating patterns for each day , so if at the weekend more time is spent at home , you could use the programmer to reflect that . <h> The hot water cylinder thermostat <p> If you have an older boiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thermostat is a great way of ensuring the temperature of the water in the tank does n't  get unnecessarily- warm . Storing water at very high temperatures increases your bills , since you need to use more gas ( or electricity if you use the immersion heater ) to heat it. - In addition , unless you 're a fan of a scalding hot shower or bath , you tend to add cold water to wash comfortably , which means you do n't  need your water to be boiling in the first place . <p> The hot water cylinder thermostat is strapped to the hot water tank and has a dial on the front where you can adjust the temperature . Normally this temperature is set between 60 and 650c , which is hot enough to kill any bacteria but not so hot as to scold you when it comes out of the tap . It is a important to check the temperature of the thermostat on your hot water cylinder , since if it is set any higher than 650c , the chances are that you can turn it down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit on your gas bill at the same time . <p> If you do n't  have a thermostat on your hot water cylinder it is certainly worth getting one fitted , since they cost less than -20 and can really help you to use less gas , but we do recommend getting a trained plumber to fit the thermostat . <h> Thermostatic radiator valves <p> Using programmers and thermostats you can , in theory , - dictate when you want the heating to come on and the temperature that you want it to be . Thermostatic radiator valves ( TRVs ) allow you additional control to further fine-tune your heating system . <p> Much like the main thermostat , these TRVs track the temperature of the room in which the radiator is situated and will turn the radiator down ( or off altogether ) once it reaches the temperature chosen by you . TRVs allow the temperature of each room to be controlled individually from one another . <p> TRVs therefore really allow you to fine tune your heating system . For example , a room may have a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home- when the sun is out . In this case , the thermostatic valve can shut off just that radiator , ensuring the occupant maximum comfort . <h> The future : intelligent heating systems <p> Heating optimisation works through an intelligent system that can- help to save consumers additional money on their energy bills . Most people set their heating to come on at least an hour before they need it ( in the mornings and evenings ) , but an intelligent heating system can sense the time it will take to heat the household to the required temperature , and turn heaters on automatically . <p> For example , a- household might get- up at 7am and want- their home to be warm for this time . The traditional timer turns the heating on at 6am and works for an hour before everyone gets up . However on warmer days , the warmup time may be shorter than on cold days . An intelligent heating system will take this into consideration and set your boiler to fire up later , meaning less fuel will be used , resulting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard programmer that at most allows you to turn your heating on or off two or three times per day . An intelligent heating system can set multiple points where you set the time and temperature requirements for that day. - The idea being- that one may have different heating requirements for each day of- the week . <p> Certain products on the market can have over 20 built-in plans , with further programmes available for customisation to an individual 's personal needs . For example , if you are a flexible worker , you can set customised patterns to suit your needs on different days . When you go on holiday , you can programme your heating not to come for the time you 're away . <p> In addition , these intelligent heating systems can be linked wirelessly to your phone or computer , so you can set the heating to come on as you are beginning your commute home .

There 's a lot more detail in regards to energy policies in the Conservatives offering but it does n't  really offer anything new . One of six main promises on the first page of the manifesto is competitive and affordable energy costs ' , and there are some promising suggestions for how to implement this , but very little about environmental measures . There is a failure to diversify around from fossil fuels , an insistence on- fracking despite public opposition , and a lot of recycled- old ideas . <h> Energy generation <p> The Conservatives set out their ultimate stance on energy in one key sentence : <p> Above all , we believe that energy policy should be focused on outcomes rather than the means by which we reach our objectives . So , after we have left the European Union , we will form our energy policy based not on the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <p> In other words , the amount of energy produced , and the profit arising from it , is more important than reducing environmental impact . Like Labour 's , Conservative energy policy centres mainly on nuclear and gas , but with a few key differences , such as its insistence on the benefits of fracking . The manifesto talks a lot about nuclear , oil and gas in terms of protecting our critical national infrastructure . ' It then goes on to assert that the Conservatives will be careful about foreign ownership of companies controlling important infrastructure ' , and mentions nuclear power as an example . This is pretty ironic , considering the fact that Hinkley Point C , the UK 's new- nuclear plant in production , is owned by EDF ! The Conservatives also promise to continue to support the North Sea oil and gas industry and build on the unprecedented support already provided to the oil and gas sector . ' <p> There 's a section on creating a diverse energy mix ' , but the only new energy source mentioned is fracking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution ' brought by fracking in the US , driving down prices and reducing reliance on imported energy . It justifies the expansion of fracking by saying shale is cleaner than coal . This might be true " but it could hardly be claimed as a green ' method of energy production and it 's irrelevant considering coal will no longer be used in the UK by 2025 . <p> The idea expressed that they will only be able to do so if we maintain public confidence in the process ' is a bit of a joke considering the UK public 's huge concerns- about the potential environmental and health impacts of the technology . They are in fact intending to circumnavigate public and legal opposition by changing planning law for shale applications . Non-fracking drilling will be treated as permitted development ' , and they will take power over the decision away from local councils , to reduce pressure . Perhaps the most worrying part of these plans is to give tax revenues to shale gas back to the communities that host extraction site , plus the option of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' It rings alarm bells that the Conservatives believe they will need to placate people by paying them , to offset their concerns . <p> Solar power is not mentioned at all , and wind just once , asserting that only offshore wind will be invested in . <h> Energy poverty <p> The manifesto acknowledges the increasing stress that rising energy prices are causing for those on the poverty line . It promises to make energy affordable ' , stating an ambition to make the UK 's energy costs the lowest in Europe . The manifesto promises the party will therefore commission an independent review into the Cost of Energy , which will be asked to make recommendations as to how we can ensure UK energy costs are as low as possible , while ensuring a reliable supply and allowing us to meet our 2050 carbon reduction objective . ' ( Its worth mentioning that this is the only reference- to reducing carbon in the entire document ) <p> The manifesto explains the common misconception that people believe they will be rewarded by choosing one of the big energy companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyal . It states that a lot of people " and especially the vulnerable " do not know that they could get a much better deal by changing supplier . It says it will maintain competition for energy companies by supporting initiatives to make the switching process easier and more reliable ' , while protecting those who do n't switch by introducing an energy price cap , limiting the amount energy companies can charge consumers . It 's nice to hear the strong words about abusive price changes ' , but it 's tempting to wonder why they 've never done anything about it until now <p> The manifesto also mentions the rollout of smart meters to hopefully give people more control over their energy bills . It says it concentrate on energy efficiency in buildings , reviewing building regulations as well as upgrading all existing fuel poor homes to EPC Band C by 2030 . However , it does n't say how it will do this , or whether homeowners and tenants will carry the cost . It seems contradictory considering the current Conservative government axed the Green Deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The manifesto 's approach to environmental issues is , like Labours , contradictory . Considering the Conservatives ' continued support of fossil fuels , and the fact the word renewable ' does n't appear once in the whole document , it 's hard to see their grounding for claiming to uphold rigorous environmental protections ' . They 've arguably shown very little commitment to environmental stuff since being elected ( slashing home renewables subsidies , not meeting air pollution targets , not investing in renewables ) . They state that As Conservatives , they are committed to leaving the environment in better condition than they inherited it . ' It then misleadingly makes a point of the UK being the first country to introduce a Climate Change Act , conveniently failing to mention that it was a Labour government ( 2008 ) that brought it in . <p> It mentions the leaving the European Union as an opportunity to take control of our environmental legislation again .

If they delivered all their promises ( especially in regards to cutting energy prices ) , it would be quite impressive " but would they , and what would the environmental cost be ? There is an uncomfortable recurring theme of profit over environment throughout . There 's no focus on- renewables , and you might also question why , if they care about consumers ' energy bills so much , they 've let the problem get worse during their 7 years in power . <p> The bottom line is that ensuring security of energy supply and reducing carbon emissions do n't  seem to be priorities for either of the two biggest political parties in the UK ! 
@@36748748 @5748748/ <h> Linking solar PV and the immersion heater <h> October 8 , 2013 <h> Immersion heaters powered by Solar PV <p> Solar PV panels produce electricity from the sun ; these panels can be coupled with the immersion heater on the hot water tank to produce free hot water using a device known as a power diverter or Solar PV optimiser. <h> -249.99 <p> The solar power diverter works by constantly measuring the electricity being produced by the solar PV on the roof and how much energy is being used in the home . As soon as there is an excess of electricity being produced , these units divert the excess electricity to the immersion unit on the hot water tank providing the household with free electricity . <h> What about the- Solar PV export tariff ? <p> Remember that almost all solar PV systems installed in the UK are grid-tied systems , that means that the electricity you produce can either be used by you in the home or the electricity gets exported very few people have electricity storage capability . <p> When you have solar PV installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for every unit of electricity you produce . This is known as the generation tariff , and currently the rate is just over 14p / kWh about the same price as buying the electricity from the energy company . The amount of electricity you produce is recorded through a generation meter . <p> As part of the Feed-in tariff , you- also get paid for exporting electricity back to the grid , through a subsidy known as the export tariff . This pays you in theory for every unit of electricity you export back to the wider energy grid for others to use . The reason we say in theory is that when the solar PV is installed , the systems are rarely installed with a export meter , instead the energy companies take the generation meter readings and half them as if you are exporting 50% . <p> Based on the fact you are going to get paid 50% of what you generate via the export tariff , it is irrelevant if you actually export 0% , 50% or 100% , you are going to always be paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not worth exporting any electricity . To maximise your solar PV investment you in fact want to export 0% of the electricity you produce this means you still get paid the export tariff , but you have this free electricity to use in your home . <p> The solar power diverter allows you to do just that never again will you export any electricity from your solar PV installation ! <h> Another reason for not exporting electricity you produce <p> Even if you are one of the few to have an export meter installed , using the electricity you produce in the home is better than exporting it because you only get paid4.64p for each unit ( kWh ) you export . If you find a way to sensibly use the electricity , then it means you do n't  need to buy- that unit from the grid , and so this produces a saving on your energy bill of about 15p/kWh . <p> Therefore it is approximately three times better to use the electricity you create rather than exporting it " although this will be saving on the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the best way to maximise the return ? <p> It is important to note though that you should n't just increase the amount of electricity you are using just for the sake of it " ideally you need to use the same amount of electricity , but just change your usage patterns so you are using it during the day when the sun is shining and you are producing it . <p> There are obviously behavioural changes that you can adopt to use more electricity during the day . For example you can set your washing machine / dishwasher to start as you leave to go to work . This will mean that they run during times of peak electrical output for your Solar PV panels . <p> The link between Solar PV panels and the immersion heater is a great way to maximise electricity usage in the home , providing you have a system or regular boiler ( i.e. you have a hot water tank ) . If you have a combi boiler unfortunately this is n't going to work for you . <h> How do- Solar PV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar PV optimisers- involve- clipping a sensor on to electrical cables that- can accurately determine in real time whether electricity is being used or exported . Once it detects that electricity is being exported it diverts the electricity to the immersion heater to heat the water . This means that you then do n't need to use gas to heat your water , thereby lowering your heating bill ( which normally makes up about 70% of your energy bill ) . <p> This technology is ideal if you produce your own electricity since it allows you to use any surplus energy you create during the day to heat water via the immersion heater . So despite me talking about solar above , you can apply this technology to wind turbines and hydroelectric electricity production too . <p> The great thing is that it will work with your existing immersion " and there is no other equipment required to make it work , making it a simple and elegant solution . <h> -249.99 <p> The units normally retail at about -350 + , but Apollo have just launched a simple unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water effortlessly from the free electricity you are producing from your solar PV system . <h> 19 comments <p> We have a pressurised hot water tank which is heated by the gas fired boiler .

Would diverting solar power to the hot water tank work in our set up ? We are thinking of getting a Hive central heating control which might overcome the joint control of heat and water issue ? <p> If an electrical solar panel system is connected directly to an immersion heater as a stand alone system what could be done with the power being produced when the domestic water has reached its temperature and the thermostat in the heater has switched itself off ? <p> I do n't  have an immersion heater fitted at present . If i have the immersion installed and only intend to use power from the solar panels to heat the water , is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water is currently heated from the boiler and I would n't intend to use mains electricity to heat the water . If this is possible , which product would you recommend ? <p> Hi Ivan , the good thing about the solar optimisers is that they only turn on the immersion heater when the home is making an excess of electricity from the solar panels . If they panels are n't  producing any electricity , then the immersion is not on and therefore the gas boiler will continue to produce all your hot water . We rate the Apollo Gem very highly , it is simple ( plug in and forget ) and good value ( just -250 ) therefore that is the one we normally suggest . <p> Hi Dave , You are going to have to find where the heating element is on the hot tub and essentially divert the electricity to this as opposed to the immersion on the hot water tank . Should be relatively simple , but speak to an electrician / plumber ! <p> Hi i have been given a solar boost controller and going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiler . I do n't  have a tank at present but will be fitted when the boiler is done . here 's my question being a bit of an optimist is there a controller available to switch a 3 way valve that is temperature controlled , should the temperature in the tank drop below a set temp . would switch over to take the hot water direct from the boiler ? Thanks Simon . <p> I have a SolarCache system and to answer some of the other questions : the immersion is always switched on at the wall but the gizmo in the airing cupboard is between the wall socket and the immersion so the gizmo becomes the switch . The gizmo then talks to the part of your system that knows how much you 're using and how much you 're generating . Whatever the surplus is , it gets routed to the immersion heater . The immersion itself then has its own thermostat to decide if it wants that power , so when the water is up to temp , it does n't  bother using it . My system has routed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lower the wattage , the longer it might take to heat the water . <p> I do n't  yet know if it might ever try to use more than 3kw though the settings in the SolarCache screen indicate it would be limited . <p> Also , I am trying to decide whether to turn up the thermostat on the immersion so that the water in the tank gets hotter it is " free " after all . That way the water might not cool below the temperature that my main heating thermostat is set at and therefore not need to be topped up later in the evening after the sun has gone to bed <p> I have a 4kW array and excess solar over my 500W base load setting goes to my 3kW immersion heater . Would a 1 or 1.5kW immersion heater be more efficient than the 3kW one currently installed especially during the autumn/winter when we do n't  generate as much ? <p> I have this arrangement , and when it works it works well . The immersion heater does NOT draw more power from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generated by the PV cells , provided of course that the thermostat is still calling for heat . So the tank stores some of my generated energy that otherwise whizzes off into the grid . Often there is more power available than is needed and so the thermostat at the end of the immersion heater turns off the power . However , I have had two immersion heaters fail now in a year . Can anyone recommend one ? James Alcock ? ? <p> If the Immersion heather is rated at 3KW and the PV array is generating less than this amount , does this mean that addition ( top-up ) power will be taken from the grid in order to reach the 3KW level of the element or does it simply use what power the PV array has available ? ie. if the PVs deliver 2KW is an extra 1KW needed from the grid to run the heather element . Or does it just accept the 2KW and take longer to heat the water tank ? Thanks <p> Hi Rog , So it would just divert the surplus amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figures you have , it would divert 2kW to the immersion heater and take a little bit longer to heat up . <p> Hi , Just read that last comment . A 3kW immersion heater takes 3kW at 230 Volts . If you are generating 1kW then the immersion heater will take a further 2kW from the mains that you 're paying for . This is physics there 's a relationship between the resistance of the immersion heater ( fixed ) , the voltage ( fixed ) and the current drawn from the mains . As the first two are unchanging , the current drawn and therefore the power are the same too . <p> Tony , this is not the case . The proportional controller ( diverter ) ensures that the immersion heater does not draw more power than the excess power available form the PV panels . It does this by modulating the voltage sent to the immersion heater with a roughly rectangular pulsing waveform where the width of the rectangular pulses is variable . Thus the AVERAGE voltage applied to the heater is limited to less than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than its nominal rating . The modulation is just a nice engineering solution to enable the controller to limit the voltage . By altering the modulation waveform the amount of limiting is varied and the neat thing is that it is adjuster to exactly match the spare electricity . Its similar to variable-wave rectification which is used on model railway controllers to enable trains to creep without stalling on a very low voltage . Careful engineering goes into these devices which is why they cost -350 . Mine is an ImmerSun and it is excellent . I strongly recommend it . <p> Hi Tony , this is the point of the solar diverters they only divert the excess meaning you do n't  export any electricity . This means you wont be drawing any mains electricity so you wo n't pay anything . Have a look at them online Apollo Gem , Immersun and Optimmersion all offer these products but there are plenty of others available too they all essentially do the same thing divert the excess ( only ! ) 
@@36748749 @5748749/ <h> Understanding your energy tariff : standing charges and usage charges <h> April 25 , 2016 <p> Over the last couple of years , the Government have made a real effort to simplify energy tariffs . We have looked at these before both electricity and gas but since these changes we thought we should revisit the subject . We can give you an idea of how much energy you are using in your home and also find a way to move to a cheaper tariff . <p> So the main change is that all energy tariffs have two parts to them now . Let 's take a look at each of them in turn : <h> The standing charge <p> The first is the standing charge " this is a daily payment that you make for the right to have electricity or gas . This can vary hugely between energy companies but you are looking at a cost of between 10p and 30p for each one . So over a 12-month period this could contribute significantly to the energy bill you end up paying . <p> For instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gas . The standing charge on my tariff for electricity 18.61p and for gas it is 16.01p . That means that it costs me -68 per year for electricity ( -0.1861 x 365 days ) and -58 for gas . This part of the bill is completely independent of how much energy you use on a day to day basis . <h> The usage- charge <p> The second part of your energy bill is all about usage . Your energy usage is measured in kilowatt hours , or kWh for short . <p> If you look closely at the instructions of any electrical device , it will normally have a power rating which tells you how much electricity it needs to work " this is normally given in watts ( W ) or kilowatts ( kW ) - ( 1000W = 1kW ) . <p> Of course , the amount of electricity it uses depends on how long it 's on for , and this is measured in kilowatt-hours ( kWh ) . <p> The example all the energy companies use to help people understand this is that 1kwh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 25 hours . <p> In our opinion this is a really terrible analogy , since more and more people are moving to LED bulbs and do n't even have a 40w bulb in their home . The numbers do n't mean much anyway ! <p> Our example numbers are calculated for a ( very bright ) 10w LED bulb " this could be on continuously for 4 days and you would use 1kWh . <h> So how much does 1kWh cost ? <p> For electricity you can expect to pay between 10 " 15p per kWh <p> For gas you can expect to pay between 2.5 " 4p per kWh <p> This is why people tend to heat their homes with central heating systems if they have the option . Heating your home with gas is about 1/3 of the price of heating your home with electricity . <h> Going back to appliances " how much do they cost to run ? <p> Remember that electricity costs between 10 " 15p per kWh , so if you know how many kWh an appliance uses you can simply multiply the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this may use might use 1-1.5kWh a day " so will cost you approximately 15p to run each day . A fridge will use less at just 1kWh so will only cost 10p a day . <p> Heating wise , a 2000w convector heater will use 1kWh in just 30 mins , so it will cost you 20p or more for every hour you have it on . <p> Tumble dryers are especially bad " sometimes as much as 3.5kWh per cycle . This is basically -0.50 per use , so if you have a washing line use it ! <p> Each time you use your electric oven it uses approximately 1.5kWh , so it will cost 15 pence or more . A gas oven uses about the same amount in kWh terms so is much cheaper to run , costing just 6-7p . An electric hob uses about 0.75 kWh per use , which will cost about 8-9p . <p> The actual kWh usage of all these appliances will vary based on their power rating , and the cost for using them will vary depending on your exact tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now then " what is an average energy bill ? <h> Looking at the electricity bill first <p> According to DECC , - the average yearly electricity usage for domestic properties in the UK is 3,800kWh . <p> So what would that cost per year ? Well I am going to take my tariff details here " and I am with First Utility " and apply them to these figures . You can see all the tariff details in the table below : <p> For electricity , my standing charge is 18.610p per day and the unit rate ( so the amount I pay per kWh ) is 12.065p / kWh . <p> Therefore the standing charge would be -0.1861 x 365 = -67.92 <p> The usage charge based on DECC 's figures would be 3,800 x -0.12065 = -458.47 <p> So the total ectricity bill is -526.39 based on my tariff rates . <h> Repeating the process for the average gas bill <p> The average domestic yearly gas usage is 15,000kWh according to this same set of statistics released by DECC . <p> Looking at the table above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my standing charge and the unit price is 2.747p / kWh . <p> Therefore the standing charge would be -0.1601 x 365 = -58.44 <p> The usage charge would be 15,000 x -0.02747 = -412.05 <p> So the total gas bill would be -470.49 based on my tariff rates . <h> The Economy 7 tariff <p> The only exception to the above is the Economy 7 tariff . This is when you pay two different rates for electricity and is normally used when people have storage heaters installed in their homes . Basically , the electricity you use at night costs less than the electricity you use during the day . The cheaper electricity is usually available either from 11.00pm to 6.00am , 12.00am to 7.00am or 1.00am to 8.00am . <p> The principles discussed are exactly the same you still have a standing charge but you have two usage rates : the night rate and the day rate . You can apply the same techniques as before to calculate your bill . <h> Take these values with a pinch of salt ! <p> It goes without saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of size and heating system . Also there are people out there who like their home to be an oven even during tshe coldest winter days . Conversely there are also people who monitor their thermostat like a hawk and never let it go above 17 degrees . <p> As such the amount of kWh used by different homes really does vary a huge amount . There are two important points to take away here : <h> Shop around for better energy deals <p> Firstly all electricity/gas is the same regardless of the supplier you are with , so unless you have a particular affinity with an energy provider , do n't be afraid to swap ! Paying less for both electricity and gas is a bit of no-brainer and there are fortunately now lots of different companies out there that offer this service completely free of charge . They do all the admin in the backend " all you need to do is take your closing meter readings and submit them . <p> The Government are really keen to push people to shop around for the best energy deals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It seems the message is sticking too " during 2015 , 6 million people switched energy provider to get a cheaper deal ! Typically , but not always , smaller energy providers can offer more competitive prices because they have lower overheads . Click on the link above and try USwitch " it literally takes two minutes ! <h> Use less energy ! <p> The other thing you can do is try to use less energy . This way , not only do you keep more money in your pocket , you are also doing your bit for the environment . There are loads of ways you can easily save energy in your home . <h> 2 comments <p> Are energy suppliers obligated to us qualified safety engineers to check the safety of the gas and electricity meters/supply of my residential property ? EDF currently use no qualified individuals , through Lowri Beck , to take readings and to visually check the meters for any issues . Is this valid ? <p> You have been using First Utility as an example , I had Economy 7 with First Utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the day rime supply , and again for the night time supply . This will make a difference of about -60 per year . This is not made clear in their advertising . On the gas side , the meter records cubic meters of gas , to get to the number of Kwhrs consumed , the usage as shown by the meter has to be multiplied by a factor of 11.16382 , then you can calculate the cost of the gas consumed .

As many of these pipes are located in the loft , they are more likely to freeze in the winter ( if cold water pipes ) , but also they can lose heat ( if hot water is sitting in them ) . To minimise the risk of both freezing and heat loss , these copper pipes can be insulated fairly cheaply with pipe insulation , often referred to as pipe lagging .

The panels create not only electricity but also produce hot water for use in the home . Two functions from one investment ! <h> Hot solar PV panels produce less- electricity <p> Contrary to popular belief , solar PV panels actually work more efficiently in cold sunny weather . People often assume that hot sunny conditions are the best , but actually as solar PV panels get warmer , they become less efficient . In fact , for an average PV panel , each degree warmer the panel becomes , it will become around 0.5% less efficient . So in the UK , where the dark solar panels regularly hit 70-800c , this could mean a 25% decrease in efficiency at peak time . <p> This is the reason why many solar installers will try to mount the solar panels on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure air can circulate around the unit to help keep it cool . <p> Bearing this in mind , the theory behind running both solar PV and solar thermal through the same panel is sound .

There is no longer the requirement to invest in separate panels to carry out the different functions which can look unsightly . One type of panel will produce both your hot water and electricity . <h> So what are the issues with solar PVT / Solar Hybrid Panels ? <p> While solar PVT hybrid panels in principal are a fantastic idea , there are 3 major issues- with them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from both the feed-in tariff and the renewable heat incentive , since you are producing electricity and renewable heat. - Having spoken to the Government teams responsible for these schemes ( Aug 2014 ) , in domestic situations they have confirmed that the PV-T hybrid solar panels in domestic installations will only benefit from the Feed-in tariff " not the RHI . However for- Non-domestic Solar PV-T installations , one would be able to claim for both the FiT and the RHI . This does mean the payback period for domestic PV-T installations is longer although for commercial applications it still makes great financial sense . The fact that the Government has approved the double income for commercial suggests that it wo n't be too long before this is extended to domestic installs too ! <p> Solar PVT panels are more expensive than- the price of traditional solar PV panels . Having said that , Solar PV-T systems can be installed at almost the same cost as the equivalent capacity of separate PV and Solar thermal and so can be a sensible investment where roof space is tight . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an individual PV panel and solar thermal panel installation but 25% more efficient than the individual technologies . Manufacturers also hope as volume builds the panel costs will come down making them a cheaper option as opposed to the traditional alternative . <p> The last issue with PV-T panels is that they produce the majority of the hot water and electricity in the summer months . In the winter months when you need a lot of hot water for space heating , the PV-T panels wo n't produce enough hot water so you will need to supplement the heating with a boiler " this however is the same problem with solar thermal too ! There are companies with a neat solution to this however , they use the summer heat to charge the ground and then use heat pumps to pull out and upgrade this heat in the winter . This keeps the panels cool in the summer , which maximises their output at the same time as increasing the source temperature for the heat pump in the winter making it run more efficiently . <h> Do Solar PVT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! PV-T can add value even without the domestic RHI . There are a few companies now that offer PV-T hybrid solar panels therefore proofing the commercialisation of this technology is the future . <p> In time , PV-T panels will surely get the necessary paperwork to profit from the financial incentives like their commercial counterparts in turn boosting their popularity . And with this will come economies of scale which will see a drop in the price of installation . But do n't forgot even now PV-T panels are on a par with the equivalent separate PV and solar thermal system . <p> We are the only UK manufacturer of PV-T panels and have numerous case studies an installations to back up the suitability of the technology . You can view our technical data section online if you wish to find out more behind the technology , including some performance charts comparing PV-T with PV and thermal in terms of carbon displacement per M2 . <p> I have collected written information from many trade publications and company web sites that manufacture or promote PVT .

In the past 4 years i have invested $100,000 with American investors to develop a self assemble thermal cooling panel for any brand of PV panels in the global market . The first testing will be carried out in Portland Maine , starting next month to take in the heavy snow fall this part of the USA see every year .

If you have a virgin loft ( i.e. 25mm or less of insulation ) then insulating it will produce massive savings on your energy bill and the great thing is that for many of us , the energy companies offer this insulation free . <p> Without proper loft insulation , a lot of the warmth produced by your heating system escapes through the roof of your property ; in fact , as much as 25% of the heat in an uninsulated house is lost in this way . Loft insulation acts as a barrier , slowing the movement of heat out of the property during the winter and into the property during the summer . <p> Even if you ca n't get it installed for free , it is an incredibly easy DIY job . In the tabs above , you can find out exactly how- to do it . <p> The first decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm loft or cold loft .

Never stand between the joists , otherwise you will more than likely come through the ceiling ! <p> Wooden boards can then be laid over all the insulation if you need to make the loft usable for things like storage . The insulating mineral wool used normally comes in rolls of blanket , which is a consistent thickness and width . <h> Sheep wool insulation <p> If you are using sheep wool insulation you will get the added benefits of the material being able to absorb moisture as well . Warm air rises from the heated rooms below and condenses when it comes into contact with cold insulation materials . Unlike other wool products , sheep wool can absorb some of this moisture and protect the joist timbers from rotting , without affecting its own insulating properties . <h> From -11/m2 <h> Loose-fill loft insulation <p> Insulating your loft floor using loose-fill is great as a top-up process for a pre-insulated space . It tends to be light material such as recycled newspapers and mineral wool , which can be spread to cover any gaps between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pour into any spaces that were previously lacking an adequate- level of insulation . This process is a fairly simple do-it-yourself job . <h> Rigid insulation boards <p> These boards , produced by companies like Celotex , are ideal for insulating loft spaces . They are more expensive than the wool , however they offer double the insulating capacity ( therefore where you would normally use 270mm of wool , you would only require 135mm of the insulating board ) . In addition , since they are rigid it is easy to store items directly on top of them without laying board on top of them first . They can be cut to size using a saw to fit between the joists and also drilled to allow room for light fittings . <h> Blown fibre insulation <p> Another type of loft insulation is blown fibre insulation , which must be installed by a professional . An installer will use specialist equipment to blow insulation material into the gaps that require it . <p> Having a carpet of insulation in your roof- will significantly reduce heat loss out of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loft insulation and consider it the no.1 method of saving energy in the home is basically because the insulation is incredibly cheap to buy and the process of producing a cold loft is so easy . <p> Now a couple of important things to mention ; while this is certainly the cheapest way to go , the loft space itself will be very cold in the winter . This means that anything you really value should be kept in the home itself , not in the loft . In addition you need to insulate any pipework and cold water tanks up in the loft as these may now be liable to freezing and the cost of repairing bursting pipes will far outweigh the energy savings produced ! <p> For detailed instructions on how to insulate your loft to produce a cold loft please click the tab here . <h> Insulating your loft at the rafters <p> Gravity is a pain " it makes producing a warm loft that much harder . Unfortunately if one tries to insulate between the rafters by squishing in lots of wool insulation then 9 times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However if your heart is set on creating a warm loft space then it is definitely possible . There are four main ways to insulate your rafters ; the first is to use netting and wool insulation . Using solid insulation board is again a really good way to minimise heat loss out of your home . The third way is simply to use reflective foil stapled to the rafters " this does n't produce significant energy savings but is by far the simplest way to go , requiring just reflective foil and a staple gun . You might want to use reflective foil anyway even if you do opt for a cold loft . <h> What materials can you use to insulate between rafters ? <p> The materials you should use to insulate the rafter space will depend on the way you have chosen to insulate , however the products used will tend to be denser and more rigid than those used for joists . <p> If you are looking to insulate between the rafters you can use both wool or insulation boards . <p> If you are looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use insulation boards or reflective foil . <p> Normally the process you decide on depends how- deep the actual rafters are . If the depth is rather shallow the best option will be to insulate below the rafters . You can in theory increase the depth yourself by attaching planks of wood top of the rafter , but then you are giving yourself more work and adding complexity to the process . <h> Mineral wool for insulating between the rafters <p> This can be glass wool , rock or mineral wool and it comes in rolls . You will need to wear protective material , a mask and have the adequate tools to fix this to the space between the rafters . The material is then fixed to the space between the rafters , whilst ensuring there is gap to the roof membrane to avoid condensation . <p> The difficulty in creating a warm loft with mineral wool insulation is basically due to the thickness of wool insulation needed to hit the necessary U-value as specified by building regulations ( 300mm ) although to be honest , if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conform . The way to keep the insulation in place is to use a net that you can then staple to the rafters which acts as a hammock for the insulation . <h> Sheep wool- for insulating between the rafters <p> If you are using sheep 's wool , which is not an irritant , then you can handle the material without wearing protective clothing . If you are using sheep wool insulation you will also get the added benefits of the material being able to absorb moisture . Warm air rises from the heated rooms below and condenses when it comes into contact with cold insulation materials . Sheep wool , unlike other wool products , can absorb some of this moisture and protect the rafter timbers from rot , without it affecting its own insulating properties . When insulating rafters , a more rigid form of sheep 's wool insulation can be used , which is more suited to rafter insulation . <h> Insulation boards- for insulating between or below the rafters <p> Insulating board can be fitted between the rafters or below the rafters . Note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going below the rafter space you will certainly lose headroom in the loft space . If your rafters are shallow then you have no choice and have to insulate below . <p> These boards , produced by companies like Celotex or Kingspan , are ideal for insulating loft spaces . They are more expensive than the basic mineral wool , however they offer double the insulating properties ( therefore where you would normally use 200mm of wool , you would only require 100mm of the insulating board ) . They can be cut to size using a saw to fit between the spaces and drilled through for cabling . <h> Reflective foil for insulating below the rafters <p> A thin layer of reflective material is placed below the rafters to prevent heat escaping from the property . This is the most simple way to insulate your loft via the rafters , but obviously the insulating properties on this type of insulation are very limited compared to either mineral wool or insulating board . <p> As mentioned , the foil is by far the easiest way to insulate your loft ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth starting at the apex of the ceiling and then working down the rafters , overlapping the foil to achieve a continuous reflect surface . You can then tape over the joins . <h> Spray foam <p> A layer of foam is sprayed into the rafters and sets hard . This can only be installed professionally . <p> When professionals come in and install spray foams , they can achieve high thermal efficiency with very little depth . The two downsides of this firstly that it is very expensive compared to the other methods and also it does n't allow the roof to breath , locking in the water next to the timber " which as we have mentioned previously can lead to problems . <p> While having a warm loft space is great because you can then use the space " you are now heating an extra room ' that you would n't normally heat if you insulated just above the ceiling ( i.e. a cold loft ) " which means your heating bill will be higher . <h> Benefits <p> A warmer home . <p> Can be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> CO2 saving of 210kg to 730kg p/a. 184564 @qwx384564 <p> None <h> Installing loft insulation <p> map . 184568 @qwx384568 <p> Interested in having loft insulation installed ? 184572 @qwx384572 <p> Hi , I am interested in getting loft insulation , but I am aware we have an electric shower in one of the rooms directly beneath the loft . I have heard the cable that powers this shower which is currently visible in the loft can not be covered , but it is tight to the joists . Is there anything I can do here so we do n't  get a big cold spot in the loft where I cant add the extra insulation . We are extremely keen to put the loft insulation in ahead of the colder months . We did this on a previous property and it made a big difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should be looking at it ? In B&amp;Q they sell Earthwool , which comes in lots of different thicknesses but I have also seen you can get Rockwool . Is there any difference or will all the wool insulations have a similar level of performance . <p> Hi , I have been reading your website for a while because I recently bought a house and am looking for some advice on the type of insulation i should be using in the loft . I have been up there and you can very easily see the top of the joists , so I guess there are a couple of inches at best . should I remove the existing loft insulation because it looks pretty tatty and start again . or do I simply roll out new insulation on top . Also i can see that there are lots of spot lights coming up in to the loft void . If I put lots of insulation on top is there a risk of those overheating ? Do you cap them or leave a space around them ? Although if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the insulation in the first place as there will be lots of places without any . My final question is about which insulation to use ? We have been recommend rockwall but it seems expensive compared to the earthwool insulation I can get at B&amp;Q . Is there really any difference or are these just brands ? Keen to get this done ASAP so any speedy advice would be very much appreciated . <p> In terms of insulating your loft , firstly it is a great idea to do lots of energy savings / lower energy bills ! In terms of the existing loft insulation , I would leave it in place to be honest , unless it is genuinely falling apart or it is very compressed since it wont be nearly as effective if this is the case . Do bear in mind that removing loft insulation is a bit of a pain ( as is installing it ) just because the wool tends to be itchy . The other reason you may want to remove it is you are starting from fresh and it is very easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you put between the joists ) but it is less easy to get rolls of 50mm insulation . Anyway you are trying to achieve a total depth of 300mm of insulation in an ideal world . All the different types of wool have slightly different characteristics , i.e sheep wool is breathable , Rockwool does n't  combust but on the whole they all provide near enough the same level of improved thermal comfort when you use the same like for like thickness . For the downlights , you can get downlight covers that sit on top of the fitting and then you can insulate around them ! Good luck with the job hope it goes well ! <p> I am looking to insulate my home with loft insulation . I wasn wondering whether to kingsman PIR board but I am worried about condensation forming and leading to damp / rotting . I want to use the kingsman though is so can easily put chipboard on the top and have a decent storage place . If you do raise the joists with timber to accomdate wool insulation is there a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> We moved into our house 5 years ago and I know it has some loft insulation , but I do n't  know what type or when it was installed . It looks a bit patchy but I 'm not sure what it 's meant to look like really ! how do we find out we need new insulation and what should we use ? <p> Hi Joel , if the install was done in the last few years , there tends to be a printed page taped to a joist in the loft detailing exactly what was installed and to what depth . If in doubt , you are looking to install 270mm of insulation or more , so get a ruler / tape measure to gauge the existing depth of the insulation . If there are areas of the loft that are a bit low in terms of the loft insulation you can always top it up by buying a couple of rolls from your local DIY store just be sure to check on the packaging the depth that the rolls comes in ( as this varies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't  very big ( in terms of depth ) then you will only want to buy the smaller thickness rolls of loft insulation . <p> We had some loft insulation installed when we moved into our house years ago but it 's really cold in the winter so I do n't think it 's doing much . Can we just add some more on the top ? Or do we have to rip it all up and start again ? How much will it cost ? <p> Hi Lewis , You can easily add an additional layer of loft insulation on top of what is already there . Over time , the amount of loft insulation that the Government recommends installing has increased . It is currently recommended that 270mm is installed in the loft ( which is why you can buy rolls of loft insulation that are 170mm in depth in case you had ever wondered ! ) so first I recommend measuring the current depth . If the insulation comes to the top of the joists you can pretty accurately estimate that 100mm of loft insulation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200mm of insulation to take you over and above the recommended 270mm . The cost will be approximately -2-3 per m2 to achieve this kind of depth of insulation . <p> has anyone heard of Micafil ? We need new loft insulation and someone recommended it to us . I just want some ideas really " do n't mind what we go for as long as it works , but just want to make sure I 'm spending the money on the right thing ! <p> Hi Rob , Micafil is pretty easy to use since it comes in bags and can be poured where required . The individual particles of Micafil are extremely light and are pretty good in terms of thermal performance although the rolls of wool do offer insulate more effectively when you compare the two like for like . <p> The downside is the cost to be honest a bag costs roughly -20 ( will do 1m2 to a depth of 100mm ) where as a roll of insulation also costs -20 and will cover 8m2 ( if you look at Earthwool ) . We actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next few weeks so stay tuned to our blogs ! <p> This loft insulation guide is extremely useful . I need to do this before the cold weather hits and know I am pretty comfortable I can do this myself without having to pay someone to come in to do this for me . I think we are going to go with the joist level insulation just because it sounds easier , but thanks for all the insight ! <p> Loft insulation is always cited as the no.1 energy saving measure and it is very easy to see why . It is very cheap and easy to do and the results are tangible energy savings that you can see on your reduced heating bills . This is a good starter piece by GreenAge again . Becoming a very useful resource for people ! <p> We got our loft insulated free last September before the winter . We have been in house for 3 years now and therefore I know how cold it used to get . The loft insulation has made a huge difference , not sure on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice and warm and takes longer to get cold when we turn the heating off . I can see why gov. were so keen for everyone to get it done ! ! <p> We insulated our loft with 200mm kinsman board . Made a huge difference and can store stuff on it . A useful introduction . Worth mentioning ventilation . Easiest was is to put spacers between loft felt flaps so air can easily flow . Lots of people forget and it can lead to condensation issues . <p> Thanks for the comment Tad , agreed adequate ventilation in the loft space is really important to prevent condensation during the cold winter months . We have heard numerous stories of people getting their loft insulated for free under the Governments ECO scheme only for the installers to not bother with the ventilation leading to items being stored in the loft getting damaged due to them becoming damp . Any installer should really install the ventilation as part of the loft insulation they install as the two do go hand in hand . Thanks for your comment though and glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I had loft insulation installed be british gas three years ago . It has made my house unbearably hot and to make matters worse our energy bill has kept going up every year . I am honestly thinking about taking the stuff out , but I went up into the loft to assess the insulation and touched it and it was very itchy . I did n't  pay for the insulation cause it was done under a government scheme but I wish i had n't  bothered at all . loft insulation is a complete waste and has n't  helped at all . <p> Hi Chris , The point of loft insulation is to slow the movement of heat in the house , so if you had this installed and did n't  turn down your heating then you would expect the house to get warmer ! Do you have a thermostat or any other type of heating control ? If so turning down the heating will make the house more comfortable ( the thermostat will prevent the home ever getting warmer than the temperature you set ) and in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulation is a bit of a no brainer it is very cheap and you can make significant savings hence we really do try and push homeowners without it to get it done . <p> Interesting article . We have a loft bedroom that was constructed by the previous tenants at least a decade ago . Its chilly and almost certainly has little insulation . I have heard that there are two different types of roofing felt , that which breathes and that which does not . Depending on which you have different insulation ( or fitting ) is advised , otherwise condensation will build up . <p> Hi Dave , Although many roofing felts are now marketed as being vapour permeable , until recently almost all felts were impervious . With breathable roofing felts you can use PIR board quite happily . With impervious roofing felts ( which are often found on older roofs ) , you have to use wool ideally sheep wool which can regulate moisture in the loft space .

When talking about primary energy use , we tend to be referring to electricity and gas , although some properties use oil or other means for heating. - Electricity in the home tends to be used for- lighting , cooling systems ( AC unit ) and electrical appliances while gas is normally used for heating and hot water generation . Energy is used 24/7 , all year round , as most homes have background appliances running all the time . <p> It is said the average home in the UK has an average energy bill of -1,326 per year which is split between electricity and gas . <p> This average house phrase is used all the time in the energy industry and more and more often we are subjected to it in the media too but what exactly is an average house ? <p> Perhaps more importantly we are going to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the UK is so diverse , not many of us are going to find ourselves living in an average home so we hope having read this you can perhaps tailor the meaning of this average home to make it slightly more specific to your home ! <h> Determining the size of a typical home <p> The most common type of dwelling here in the UK- is a- three bed- semi-detached property with 2-3 occupants . The average home- comprises of a living room , - kitchen , bathroom and 2 or 3 bedrooms . The average home tends to have been built from- solid brick 220mm walls ( instead of cavity walls ) , double or single glazing with modest loft insulation and some form of central heating system . <p> According to RIBA ( The Case for Space : the size of England 's new home , Royal Institute of British Architects , September 2011 ) - a survey of- a sample of 3,418 homes across 71 sites concludes- that an average three-bedroom home has a internal floor area of approximately 88m2 . <h> Average energy cost for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 2015 , the annual average dual fuel customer bill in the U.K. was -1,326 as can be seen in the table- below ( source : Ofgem ) .

So , the total heat losses of the house are therefore determined by the fabric and ventilation heat losses . The fabric heat losses can be calculated working out the surface of the exposed- external walls and then calculating the- u-values of each element . The ventilation losses depend on the cubic volume of each room and the air changes per hour through open windows and other forms of infiltration. - <p> For example , the fabric heat loss coefficient of an average semi-detached 2-storey house of medium size ( Total floor area : 98m2 , - Total window area 8m2- South and 8m2- North ) can be given by the next equation : <p> cf = + UxA ( W/K ) where , <p> cf- is the fabric heat loss coefficient , <p> + UxA is the sum of the products of the U-values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the building <p> degree-days are the number of days when the average outside temperature is lower than a base temperature- above which a building needs no heating . <p> The degree-day figures normally assume a balance temperature or degree-day base temperature of 15.5-C . As can be seen in the next map , the value for London is approximately 2100 Degree days , for Newcastle 2400 and for Plymouth 1900 . This figure is supposed to be representative of most dwellings , but for very well insulated dwellings and many commercial buildings it is too high , and leads to significant overestimates of annual space heat demand . <p> Figure 5 : Degree Days map of UK based on- 15.5-C <p> The next table shows the space heating demand for 3 different UK locations . Notice that this is the price for space heating only and not for the total gas consumption that comes from the hot water and cooking too . <p> - <p> Degree-days <p> Annual space heat demand <p> Cost for heating <p> Newcastle <p> 2,400 <p> 10,368 kWh <p> -363 <p> London <p> 2,100 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kWh <p> -287 <p> * Gas unit price is taken as 3.50p/kWh <h> The- space heating type <p> The main sources of heating are gas and electricity , but some homes are heated by- oil and even biomass pellets .

Non-condensing gas boilers have efficiency between 0.65 and 0.70. - We will now use the gas boiler example to demonstrate how to calculate the useful heating required for your home . <p> To- calculate the space heating- required take the gas consumption for the home in kWhs ( you can look at your annual gas bill statement ) and then divide this figure by- the average efficiency of your heating system . <p> For example , for an average house like we described previously located in London , to reach the required space heating demand of 9,072 kWh the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9,072 kWhs of gas/ 0.87 SPF = 10,428 kWh for this particular- house , assuming continuous heating throughout the heating season ( the six months around Christmas ) . <p> For a non-condensing boiler : 9,072kWhs of gas/ 0.65 SPF = 13,957 <p> Type of Boiler- <p> Required space heating- ( kWh ) <p> Boiler efficiency <p> Energy consumption ( kWh ) <p> Condensing Boiler <p> 9,072 <p> 87% <p> 10,428 <p> Non-condensing Boiler <p> 9,072 <p> 65% <p> 13,957 <p> Save <p> 3,529 <p> According to Sedbuk , the annual fuel costs for different boiler types is : <p> Boiler Type <p> Flat <p> Semi-detached <p> Detached <p> Boiler efficiency <p> Old gas heavy weight <p> -779 <p> -1204 <p> -1705 <p> 55% <p> Old gas light weight <p> -659 <p> -1019 <p> -1442 <p> 65% <p> New non-condensing <p> -549 <p> -849 <p> -1202 <p> 78% <p> New condensing <p> -481 <p> -744 <p> -1053 <p> 89% <p> *These figures are based on a gas unit price of 4.36p per kWh ( April 2013 ) <h> Quality of- wall , floor and loft insulation <p> The average energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK is SAP60 , which- puts it into a- band D. At SAP60 the insulation quality of a home can be described as moderate with areas that could certainly be- improved . There are millions of homes though that have a far lower SAP energy score though - particularly- homes built before 1930 , when insulation quality was n't really a consideration . <p> Below we look at a home with- some of the typical characteristics including the property fabric , quality of insulation and information on the heating system . <p> This is a typical- semi-detached house with- 4 habitable- rooms , built between 1930 and 1949 with solid brick walls . There is no wall insulation and very little in the loft . The windows are double-glazed . The central heating system uses gas and the total area of a house is 100m2- and is occupied by 4 people . <p> This type of house would have the following kind of SAP information <p> We ran some numbers through the- RDSAP calcualtion method , and the typical household energy bill for such a house is -1,576 , 65% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prices for electricity and gas , 12.5p/kWh and 3.5p/kWh respectively , this house consumes 4,413kWh for electricity and 29,269kWh for gas per year . <p> Figure 5 : Fa+ade of a common detached maisonette <p> Figure 6 : Floor plans of a common detached maisonette <p> - <h> The external wall area and windows area <p> The type of glazing and the frame type are responsible for the heat losses through the windows . Most of the UK houses have already replaced the old single-glazed windows and frames and they are now double-glazed . The ventilation and infiltration rate through the glazing and the frames is calculated given the volume of the house and the air changes per hour . <p> So , for an average UK house with double-glazed windows the air changes per hour are 0.8-1.0 and for double-glazed windows are 0.3 . <p> - <p> ACH <p> Ventilation loss coefficient cv <p> Required space heating- ( kWh ) <p> Single-glazing <p> 0.8 <p> 65 <p> 9,072 <p> Double-glazing <p> 0.3 <p> 24.5 <p> 7,031 <p> Save <p> 2,041 <h> The efficiency of the appliances and lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights , each of them consuming 50W of electricity .

So , you would have a reduction of 90% in your electricity consumption for lighting . Taking into account that- lighting and home appliances tend to account for 20% of a typical energy bill this investment will save a significant amount of your money . <h> The occupancy <p> The heating and cooling loads of a home are influenced by the internal gains of the people who live at the house .

The main difference is that the fuel used is stored on site rather than coming off the grid ' . The fuel is used to heat water in the boiler , which can then be used for hot water or for heating the home via a central heating system . <h> Oil or LPG ? <p> Heating oil is a liquid and is generally a bit cheaper than LPG . The advantage in LPG is that you can use it as a fuel for your oven and hob , or your gas fire , whereas heating oil is a lot more restricted to the boiler only . The boiler itself is very similar , but the important differences come with the costs and charges for the various fuels . <h> How expensive is oil ? <p> A typical heating oil or LPG system will be more expensive to run than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not always possible to get mains gas in your property , and for those people , oil is an effective way to heat your property .

Often the supplier will not let you change suppliers either " using the principle that if it is their tank " they only want their fuel in it . That means it is less easy to shop around for better rates with these fuels than it is with gas and electricity . <h> How much do they cost to install ? <p> The boiler installation itself is going to cost a similar amount to a gas boiler install " typically anywhere from -1,500--2,000 .

You can learn more about what a U-value is by clicking here . <p> The U-value signifies the heat lost through a given thickness of a particular material . You do n't really need to understand the mechanics of how it is calculated " instead it is useful to be able to compare different substances by their U-values . <p> The best insulating materials have a U-value of close to zero " the lower- the better . Building regulations currently stipulate that for a new building , the elements must have maximum U-values as follows : <p> Wall " 0.3 W/m2k <p> Roof " 0.15 W/m2k <p> Windows " 1.6 W/m2k <p> So in each section below we are going to examine each of the different elements and their typical U-values , we will then show you how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations ( Part L ) . <h> U-values of SOLID WALLS <p> Solid walls were the norm in most properties built prior to the 1930s unfortunately at this time energy efficiency was n't really on the radar , since fuel was very cheap . However nowadays trying to keep this sort of home warm is very costly , so insulating them can considerably lower the heating bill . <p> An uninsulated solid brick wall with a thickness of 225mm value will have a U-value of 2.70 W/m2k <p> To insulate a solid wall you can either insulate internally or externally . <p> 100mm of EPS- insulation located internally or externally should bring the U-value of the wall down to 0.29 W/m2k in line with building regulations ( in this example we have use EWI-PRO 100mm graphite EPS with thermal conductivity ++=0.032W/mk ) <p> To achieve this with rockwool insulation you will need to add about 110mm to either the inside or outside wall ( in this example we have use rockwool 100mm with thermal conductivity ++=0.036W/mk ) " obviously if this is done externally you will need to attach it firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you want to do this internally it is going to steal a large area of floor space . <p> ThermaLine Plus is internal wall insulation ( often referred to as dry-lining ) attached to plasterboard and if you opt for the 40mm thick ThermaLine Plus you should achieve a U-value of about 0.65 W/m2k . This is n't bad , but if you need to adhere to building regulations ( i.e. it is a new extension for example ) you are going to have to opt for something else . <h> U-values of CAVITY WALLS <p> Cavity walls became the norm in the 1930s . However until 1995 we assume that they were built but left unfilled ( with insulation ) . <h> - Unfilled cavity walls <p> Unfilled cavity wall ( built prior to 1900 ) will have a U-value of 2.0 W/m2k <p> For a new build cavity wall to achieve a U-value of- 0.2 W/m2k you would need to install 150mm of wool but this obviously means extremely thick walls " but this is the cheapest option available to builders . <p> Using Celotex to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only need to use 100mm celotex to achieve a U-value of- 0.2 W/m2k . The only thing to bear in mind here is that you still need to keep a residual cavity on the outside " but this means the cavity can be marginally thinner . <p> The maximum U-value you can achieve by retrofitting cavity wall insulation in any property older that 1975 is 0.5 W/m2k since you are limited by the thickness of the cavity . In this instance to achieve a U-value of less than 0.2 W/m2k , you need to apply either internal or external wall insulation too , although you will only need to apply 50mm of celotex either internally or externally to achieve this . <p> If you retrofit insulation in cavity walls built between 1970 and 1995 , you should achieve a U-rating of 0.5 W/m2k . <p> Any cavity wall after that date should already have cavity wall insulation as part of building regulations " the U-values of these types of walls can be seen above in the Filled Cavity Walls section . <h> 40 comments <p> Your definition of U value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the heat loss per degree temperature difference for a given completed building element per square m ( eg a brick cavity wall with 80mm of kinspan .

A programmer allows the occupant to specify when the heating comes on to match their lifestyle and their heating requirements . <p> For many people in the UK , this simply means firing up the heating in the winter months for a couple of hours in the morning , so the house is warm when they wake up , and then firing the heating up again in the evening so the house is warm when they get home until they go to bed . <p> This means that the heating wo n't be on in the interim times , for example during the day when they are at work , or in the middle of the night ( although some people do like a warm house even when asleep ! ) . <p> Programmers range massively in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of boiler " combi or heat only . A combi boiler produces hot water on demand whilst a heat-only boiler ( despite the name ) , produces hot water that gets stored in a hot water tank until required . <h> Two-channel programmers versus single-channel programmers <p> With a heat-only boiler , you need a two-channel system : one channel that allows you to program when the hot water is being produced and the other for the heating in the home . <p> For a combi boiler , you only require a single channel programmer " since you are only worried about when the heating comes on . <p> It is not uncommon for us to encounter boilers that have a malfunctioning two-channel programmer , where the heating and hot water are tied to one another " so when you turn the heating on , the hot water is being produced and vice-versa ! <h> Accuracy of heating programmer <p> Once you have established what type of programmer you need " a single or dual channel system , then you can choose the functionality you need . <p> Obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . For example Monday to Friday it might be very similar , however on Saturday/Sunday , you might require the heating to come on later in the morning . <p> There are essentially three types of programmer that each allow you different levels of control . There are one-day programmers that allow you to specify when the heating comes on each day but every days heating pattern will be mirrored . <p> So with this type of programmer you might opt for something like this . <p> Depending on the type of programmer you have it may also allow you to set further time slots for the heating to come on " e.g. instead of just heating the home morning and evening , it may allow you to specify 2 hours in the morning , 2 hours at midday and then a few hours in the evening . <p> The most advanced ( but the one than can most accurately match your heating requirements ) is the 7-day programmer and most bought today would be of this type . This allows you to set heating requirements for each day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of programmer you might opt for something like this ( based on the fact that this occupant works from home Tuesday and Thursday ) . <p> The good thing about the new programmers is that they allow you to dumb down the complexity if you do n't want it " so if your heating requirements are fairly simple you may just wish to go with 5-7 functionality . <h> The override button <p> All new programmers will have an override button , which can give your heating or hot water ( if you have a heat only boiler ) a boost . If you are using a lot of hot water for example ( and you have a hot water tank ) you can hit the override button and it will fire up the hot water for an additional hour " allowing you to run more showers or baths . <h> Programmers working with thermostats and TRVs <p> You can find more information on thermostats here , but they can be used in conjunction with programmers . The programmer means that the boiler will only fire up as per the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature the thermostat will instruct the boiler to turn off . <p> Working together , thermostats and programmers and TRVs compliment each other to help you tailor your heating demands . This means not heating rooms unnecessarily and also no overheating which helps reduce heating bills . <p> Taking heating systems a step further you might want to consider intelligent heating control systems which allow you to monitor and change the temperature in individual rooms and learning functionality like Geofencing . <p> Even so , in reality we would advise people to also get programmers because if you are out of the property for an extended period of time it is worth having ensuring the heating comes on occasionally in winter to stop pipes freezing the cost of which would far outweigh the energy savings !

So you can start not only making money by producing electricity via the subsidies available , but also use the electricity you produce to lower you bills . <p> One of the key factors impacting the amount of electricity your solar panels produce is the temperature at which they operate . It is easy to presume that more sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wrong . <p> Different solar panels react differently to the operating ambient temperature , but in all cases the efficiency of a solar panel decreases as it increases in temperature . <p> The impact of temperature on solar panel efficiency is known as the temperature coefficient . <h> The Temperature Coefficient <p> If you look at the datasheet provided by your solar panel manufacturer they will refer to a term normally described as the temperature coefficient pMax . This value , which is normally given in the form of negative percentage , reveals the impact of temperature on the panel . <p> Solar Panels are power tested at 250C , so the temperature coefficient percentage illustrates the change in efficiency as it goes up or down by a degree . For example if the temperature coefficient of a particular type of panel is -0.5% , then for every 10C rise , the panels maximum power will reduce by 0.5% . <p> So on a hot day , when panel temperatures may reach 450C , a panel with a temperature coefficient of -0.5% would result in a maximum power output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunny winter 's morning , the panels will actually be more efficient . <p> Each type of solar cell has a different temperature coefficient detailed below <p> Both Monocrystalline and Polycrystalline cells have a temperature coefficient pMax of between -0.45% to -0.50% <p> Amorphous based thin film panels have a rating of between -0.20% to -0.25% . <p> The Hybrid solar cells currently on the market sit in the middle with a temperature coefficient pMax of between -0.32% <h> What can you do to stop your Panels getting too hot ? <p> Firstly in the process of making the panels , companies use a thermally conductive substrate is help vent excess heat from the glass layer . <p> Your solar panel installer will also try to ensure there is a free flow of air above and below the solar panels when they are mounted , by elevating the panels a few inches off the roof .

By having a smart meter it can give you a lot more control over when you choose to increase or decrease your energy usage . The idea is that smart meters will result in lower levels of energy consumption , which means this will reduce the carbon emissions from each household . <p> It is fair to say that smart meters have attracted some level of controversy , but some of the concerns we hear about seem to be influenced more by conspiracy theories than by facts . They are governed by strict security regulations and there is no evidence to suggest that they are hazardous to health . <h> Why have smart meters been introduced ? <p> Smart meters could be good news for householders , because they put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sign up for time of use ' tariffs , allowing them to benefit from cheap rates . <p> UK energy network infrastructure could be put under less strain as a result of time of use tariffs . They pave the way for the National Grid to better manage power supply by reducing peaks in demand . This could have a role to play in avoiding an approaching energy deficit in the UK . <p> In the UK , the population is increasing and energy demand is high . This is coupled with the decommissioning of many of our existing nuclear and coal power plants , which will decrease the amount of electricity we are producing . Also , renewables such as- solar- PV- and- wind- produce power intermittently , so we need a grid that is more flexible to meet these supply and demand issues . <p> Smart meters should allow utility companies to better match demand with supply , by encouraging people to use energy at different points in the day other than traditionally peak ' times ; thereby making a more efficient electrical grid . <h> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and electricity readings directly to your energy supplier via a purpose-built secure national network ( DNN ) , using radio waves . As well as new gas and electricity monitors , you also get an in-home display . This shows you your energy consumption in the last day , week or month . It also tells you how much you have spent . Smart gas- meters are battery-powered and send readings every half hour . Smart electricity meters run off mains electricity and give moment-to-moment readings. - The in-home display is also wired into the mains . It costs less than -1 a year to run . <h> How can I get a smart meter ? <p> They are provided and installed by energy providers , in place of the ones you have now . If you do not already have a smart meter , you will be contacted in the next few years to arrange ( free ) installation . If you have different suppliers for gas and electricity , the person installing the second meter- will link it to the first , and to your in-home display . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> The Government has ordered a national rollout of smart meters by 2020 . Energy providers are expected to take all reasonable steps ' to install smart meters in every home . However , they can not force you to have one . <p> If you decide to opt out , your supplier will probably still swap your meter for a new model , but they can put it into dumb ' mode . This means the meter 's smart ' functionality is turned off so it will not transmit readings automatically and will need to be read in the old way . <p> There is some speculation that energy companies might not be happy about some people doing things differently , as installing smart meters could cut their admin costs in the long run . They could raise energy prices for those with dumb ' meters as an incentive to cooperate . <p> If you have any questions about the installation process , or your options , you should contact your energy supplier . <h> What do smart meters mean for the future ? <p> As we mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payers and help the UK to balance energy supply and demand . <p> If you have a smart meter , you can benefit from cheap rates on time of use tariffs . The lowest of these at the moment is 4p per hour , so if you can get used to using your energy at off-peak times , you could potentially save a lot of money . <p> As the energy mix becomes more complex in terms of supply and demand continues to grow , smart meters will become a powerful tool to allow utility companies to continue to supply customers with uninterrupted electricity supply as and when it is needed . <h> What are the advantages of smart meters ? <p> First of all , you will no longer have to read meters or send readings yourself . <p> No more estimated bills " you only pay for what you use . <p> They come with energy monitors that allow you to better check your energy usage , and make necessary changes .

This will highlight things like which appliances use high amounts of electricity ( which potentially can be replaced with more energy efficient models ) . It can also highlight when your home is using peak power , allowing you to adjust your behaviour and try to use less power . <p> Using smart meters with time of use tariffs will help even demand during the day by charging more at peak times and less at off-peak times . This means that the installed peak capacity can be reduced . As our energy mix becomes more complicated , as a result of more energy sources feeding into it " energy companies can use the smart grid to better manage supply and demand . <p> They make it easier for prepayment customers to top up , without the need for a key or a card . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be more straightforward . <h> What are the disadvantages of smart meters ? <p> Although they are billed as being free ' , the installation fee will be indirectly passed on to residents through their energy bills . However , the -11 billion cost of installing them nationwide will only cost individual households an estimated -6 per year . And " when used in conjunction with time of use tariffs " they could save people quite a lot more than that . <p> Some people are worried that smart meters can affect health . However , the level of radio wave exposure from smart meters is well within guideline levels , and also lower than that from wifi and mobile phones . Public Health England says smart meters are safe . You can view detailed- information from the Government- here . <p> There are concerns about energy companies sharing personal data .

Should this not read newer , more efficient , power plants will fire up ? ? <p> Rob , sadly if you look at the energy mix at the minute , there new plants are running at full capacity and the mothballed coal power plants are being used to supplement the demand . It is absolutely ridiculous . <p> Anyway the good news this week is that as a result of smart meters , Green Energy UK have now just released the first time of use tariff in the UK . This charges people different amounts depending when in the day they use the electricity ( a little like Economy 7 , but more time slots with different rates ) .

Insulating the joists is often the easier of the options- and especially makes sense if you have no real plans to use the loft space . <h> Key points before you start <p> If your loft is easy to access , the insulating process should be pretty straightforward and can be undertaken as a DIY job . However , if you have any doubt in your own ability to carry out the work , we recommend getting a professional to do it . <p> Normally , people use mineral wool ( either glass fibre or Rockwool ) to do the job and if you intend to do the same it is imperative you wear protective clothing , goggles and a face mask , since the wool is an irritant . <p> You can use sheep wool insulation , which is much nicer to handle , 100% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wool insulation . If you are happy to pay a little extra we really recommend using this . <p> As a final warning , never stand between joists otherwise you will more than likely come through the ceiling which is never ideal . Using a board supported by several joists is the best way of working in the loft area regardless of whether you are insulating the joists or the rafters . <h> Preparing the loft space ready to insulate <p> Before you get to the business end of installing loft insulation up in your roof , - you need to make sure you have prepared the loft space and also bought the right quantity of materials- to do the job . Below is a- quick step-by-step guide on what you should do before you begin any swork but before this a quick word of warning ! <p> Please remember not to step in between the joists - otherwise you will end up falling through the loft ! Make sure you only stand of the joists themselves , ideally using a plank as a kneeling board . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight more evenly and reducing the load on the joist structure. - The board should go across at least 3 joists to ensure it spreads the weight sufficiently . We also recommend covering your skin with suitable clothing and using a face mask , as stray fibreglass can act as an irritant if it comes into contact with skin . <p> Before installing the loft insulation : <p> Clean the space between the joists by vacuuming between them , removing any dust that may have settled there over time . <p> Make sure you pay attention to any cracks , dry rot or damage to the joists . If the are looks unsafe to work in , stop what you are doing and immediately seek professional help to repair these areas . <p> Ensure- good lighting in the loft to provide decent visibility to help you do the work . <p> If you have boards fixed to your joists you need to remove these- before you begin insulating the loft space . <p> Once you have the loft space ready to insulation- we recommend doing a- quick- equipment check below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Tough pair of scissors to cut the loft insulation <p> Measuring tape <p> Protective overalls and gloves when handling mineral wool ( otherwise it is itchy ! ) <p> Safety goggles <p> A disposable mask <p> The protective overalls , gloves , goggles and mask are really worth using the mineral wool insulation most people tend to use to insulate the loft is incredibly itchy , so making sure your skin is covered is a good way of avoiding- this . <h> Measuring the size of your loft <p> After you have cleared bulky objects you can see the area more clearly on what you can insulate . When measuring your loft space you need to start with the following : <p> Take a measuring device and measure the whole area of your loft ( this is simply the width multiplied by the length ) . <p> Take into consideration the thickness you want to insulate to and if there is any pre-existing insulation in place , we recommend using 300mm if using wool insulation and 150mm if using the rigid insulating boards like Celotex or Kingspan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool insulation comes in two widths 380mm and 570mm the idea is you go for the one that is closest to width of your joists so it minimises cutting . <p> Measure the height of your joists normally this is about 100mm . This means that if you are looking to insulate to a depth of 300mm in total , you will first lay down a layer of 100mm thick wool between the joists , then use 200mm thick wool laid across the joists at a 90 degree angle . <p> Write down these measurements on a piece of paper and then take them with you to a DIY shop to buy the insulation or visit an online retailer . Just a word of warning : insulating wool is really bulky and so unless you have a huge car , you might be better off having- it delivered directly to your home . <h> Installing loft insulation- between the joists <p> Insulating the loft at joist level is actually pretty easy to do as a DIY job , but if you feel uncomfortable doing the work then please call in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulating properties , building regulations use a U-value- that needs to be attained to conform . This allows you to calculate the thickness of your chosen insulation product required to conform with building regulations , for example if you opt to use mineral wool , you will need to use 270mm-thick insulation to reach the 0.16 U-value specified in building regs . <p> To insulate your loft at joist level , please follow the steps below : <p> STEP 1 : The first thing to do is to check whether there are light fittings that protrude- between the joists- ( e.g. a GU10 spotlight will always have the fitting protruding into the loft ) , if there are , these will require capping prior to laying any insulation . These caps , sometimes referred to- as downlight fire hoods or insulation guards , allow sufficient space around the light fitting for the heat- to dissipate to stop the light getting too warm . Each light fitting will require- a cap to prevent this overheating they are simply placed over the light fitting and then you are good to go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wool insulation needs to be laid between the joists , so you need to measure the distance between the joists to ensure you can get the right width of product . Typically the gap between the joists is either 380mm or 570mm so you will need a width of insulation similar to this , so it can fit snugly between the joists . Most insulation you buy will be partially- perforated , allowing you to cut the roll of insulation easily to produce either 2 rolls that are 570mm wide or 3 rolls that our 380mm wide . If the insulation is n't partially perforated , you will need to use scissors to cut it to the necessary thickness . <p> STEP 3 : Once the insulation is the correct width , you need to roll it out between the joists ; lightly press the insulation material to fit between the joists , but be careful not to overdo it and compress the material . Joists tend to be only about 100mm high ( although this can vary ) , so match the insulation thickness you buy with the joist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the joists . You will need to work the insulation around and over any downlight- caps that- may now be present . <p> STEP 4 : You now need to spread an additional- 170mm 200mm thick insulation at 90 degrees to the- joists. - Starting at the furthest point from the loft hatch slowly unroll the insulation over the top of the joists- make sure you use- kneeling boards to spread the weight load and reduce the risk of ceiling collapsing as you move around in the loft space . This second thicker layer of insulation should have no gaps between the strips that you lay out it should produce a continuous layer of insulation- you will no longer be able to see the joists . This will take the total thickness of the insulation in the loft to 270mm 300mm as specified by building regulations . You may like to install even thicker than this , but the energy savings of doing so will be negligible . <p> STEP 5 : - As a final step you will- need to insulate the loft hatch , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This can be stapled to the top of the loft hatch , helping to preserve a consistent thermal barrier . You can also fit draught proof strips on the outside of the hatch to stop gusts of cold air in the winter . A really easy way to do this is to fill a black bag with insulation and then tape this down to the top of the hatch using thick tape . <p> Although- 270mm 300mm is the optimum depth recommended for mineral wool , but if you are planning on using one of the other insulating materials such as loose fill , it is worth reading the guidelines provided by the manufacturer to ensure you use a sufficient volume to give the required depth . Putting more than 270mm on insulation within your loft ( e.g. 350mm ) will help you heat your house for less , but the savings equal the cost of laying the additional insulation so you may deem this unnecessary . <h> Storing items in the loft but still insulating to building regulations <p> As we have said , the more insulation the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wool insulation as a minimum . One of the issues with putting this much insulation in the loft space is that you lose sight of the joists . Many people like to use the loft space as storage , however , so will insulate only- to the top of the joists and then attach chipboard directly to the joists making a solid , walkable surface . Obviously if you install 300mm this is not possible , so prior to STEP 4 above , you will need to install loft stilts ( or loft lifters ) . <p> These are relatively simple to install , and are essentially strong plastic stilts that raise the height of the joists , allowing you to install the extra insulation and then attach chipboard on top of the them . This allows you to still produce a- useable surface- while also maximising the thickness of insulation you install . <h> Using rigid- insulation board- as loft insulation <p> Some people may prefer to use rigid insulation board to insulate the loft space for example Celotex or Kingspan- the process is pretty similar to above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same insulation levels ( than mineral wool ) . You will also need a hacksaw to cut the insulation to size . If you do decide to use rigid insulation board , then you will still need to use chipboard if you want to walk on it . <h> Insulating water tanks in the loft <p> One- issue that arises from insulating the loft space just above the ceiling ( i.e. in the joists ) is that the loft space itself will become incredibly cold . During very cold weather the temperature could even become- sub-zero , which if you have water tanks in the loft , could be a big issue ! <p> If you do have cold water tanks in the loft , first of all , never insulate underneath them ; always allow heat to travel up through the roof into the bottom of the cold water tank . Also , it is worth insulating the cold water tanks themselves and lagging any pipework you can see in the loft that sits above the insulation you have installed in the joists . The kit required to insulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can be purchased from any good DIY store . <p> Hi Was just wondering do you have any advice when using the celotex/kingspan method , you mention in the wool method about the insulation guards/downlighter caps . 1 , would you have to cut holes in the celotex/kingspan , , and also mark the the chipboard flooring where they are situated , just incase you need access in the future , <p> 2 , If your joists are 100 mm , can you put a 100 mm rigid board or do you need a gap between ceiling and insulation ie 75 mm board and 25 mm gap or does this not matter with the cold roof method . <p> 3 , And if i use rigid board what side should i put towards ceiling the foiled side or buy board with two sides foiled <p> Hi Robbie , thanks for getting in touch . In terms of the fittings it depends a little bit on the total thickness of loft insulation . Obviously if you are just going with 100mm ( situated between the joists ) then there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in question . How far do the downlights protrude into the roof space ? Otherwise I would be tempted to say to cut holes around the fittings in the first 100mm of board . The next boards should then be laid at 90 degrees to these taking the total depth to 200mm ( you can get away with anything above 170mm for celotex / kingspan loft insulation ) . So the top insulation boards wont have holes in just the boards between the joists . Then you will minimise the thermal bridging . <p> In terms of the gap it is not necessary here to be honest try and push down the celotex as far as you can but in our experience it is almost impossible to get the celotex perfectly flush with the ceiling plasterboard , so some air flow occurs anyway . If you are trying to complete a warm loft ( i.e. you put the insulation between the rafters ) then you do 100% need a gap for air flow if using this type of board . <p> This was the first thing we did when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free , british gas came and did it becuase they did a survey and there was not enough existing loft insulation so it did n't  cost us a penny . Our house is really nice and warm and I am sure that is in some part down to this insulation . I think it is one of the things this government seem to have got right . From my experience on the day , I do n't  think it is very hard to do yourself as a DIY job , the guys wore boiler suits masks and gloves I guess to protect against the itchy wool , but it took them 20 minutes and I went up and checked the whole area was covered with the loft insulation . The only problem with insulating the floor of the loft is that I cant now see see the joists . <p> This is a great little guide . I insulated my loft with 300mm of wool , but then quickly reaslised you ca n't store anything on top of that since it compresses the insulation so it is less effective .

@@36748760 @5748760/ <h> What is photosynthesis ? <p> Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight to synthesise foods from carbon dioxide- and water . The process combines 6 molecules of carbon dioxide- and 6 molecules of water to produce one molecule of glucose and 6 oxygen molecules . The glucose is stored in the plant as starch and cellulose which are simply long chain glucose molecules ( known as polysaccharides ) - as a source of food for the plant to survive and grow . The oxygen that is produced as a byproduct of photosynthesis- is what most animals- rely on to breath , so the process plants and trees fulfil on our behalf is critical to our survival . <p> We already can harness light energy from the sun- to produce electricity via solar photovoltaic cells , however there is a fundamental issue- with electricity- that we are currently facing and that is that we have no suitable way of storing the electricity produced- ( batteries are limited ) , so we have to use the electricity- as it is produced otherwise we essentially lose it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sun- within the chemical bonds in the glucose molecule . Therefore plants are not only producing energy , but they also have the ability to store it . <h> Artificial photosynthesis <p> If we could somehow artificially replicate the photosynthetic process completed by plants , we would be able to lower carbon dioxide- concentrations in the atmosphere , while also producing sugar that we could use for food and energy production . The ultimate goal though is to take the- natural process of photosynthesis and improve it , making it more efficient , absorbing more light , at a wider range of wavelengths , potentially even in the dark to produce more energy . <p> There are three major scientific challenges in artificial photosynthesis that we need to find answers to before we can create fuel directly from sunlight on an economical scale : <p> 1. - Light capture and moving the electrons to the reaction centres <p> 2. - Splitting water into Hydrogen and Oxygen <p> 3. - Reducing Carbon Dioxide <h> Overcoming the challenges in artificial photosynthesis <p> In plants , light capture is handled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( along with accessory chlorophyll pigments ) absorbs all photons with a wavelength of 430-700nm , and through a complex process first splits water into its constituent parts , then combines hydrogen with carbon dioxide- to make the sugars . In artificial photosynthesis we are proposing to use nanoparticles to not only replicate this process but improve its efficiency . <p> If we use light capturing titanium dioxide nanoparticles on any surface it dramatically increases the surface area and therefore the light capturing potential of the surface . If this titanium dioxide is coupled with a dye and then immersed in an electrolyte solution with a platinum cathode , electrons are excited to the extent they are displaced and produce a current . <p> This current can then be used to split the water into its molecular components , thereby storing the solar energy in chemical bonds , particularly in the reduced form of hydrogen , again in the presence on nanoparticles , more specifically iridium oxide nanoparticles . <p> In the final part of natural photosynthesis ( known to biologists as the Dark Reactions ) , carbon dioxide- is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calvin Cycle , eventually producing one molecule of glucose . <p> Scientists are currently trying to establish the most efficient form of naturally occurring ribulose biphosphate , with a view to making a wholly artificial nanotechnology-based version that is more efficient than it 's naturally occurring relative . <h> Artificial photosynthesis research today <p> There are many barriers to actually recreating the natural process of photosynthesis that we need to overcome , so we are still very much in the early research and development phase on making artificial photosynthesis as a viable energy source . <p> Research is - going on all over the world currently trying to crack what could one day become the renewable fuel of the future , not only using the suns energy more effectively than Solar PV currently does ( and leaves themselves ) , but also helping to- remove some of the- carbon dioxide that humans have added to the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels . <p> Thomas Fuance , a professor at the Australian National University , feels that artificial photosynthesis could one day be the game changer , providing cheap fuel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pushing for a worldwide- collaborative approach to research this area , similar to ITER , or the Human Genome project , sharing data and thereby concentrating on the most promising emerging technological solutions . <p> In August 2011 he coordinated the first international conference dedicated to the created of- Global Artificial Photosynthesis Project at Lord Howe island . <h> Other approaches being used to mimic photosynthesis <p> Nanotechnology is not the only avenue we are using trying to mimic photosynthesis . Another method involves using giant parabolic mirrors direct and concentrate sunlight onto two chambers separated by a ring of cerium oxide . The energy from the sun heats this cerium oxide up to 15000c , which in turn releases an oxygen atom into one of the chambers and is pumped away . The deoxidised cerium is then moved- into the other chamber , where carbon dioxide- is pumped in , and the deoxidised cerium steals one of the oxygen molecules , creating carbon monoxide , and the more stable cerium oxide , which can be reused in the reaction . A similar reaction is used to separate water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Finally , a process first carried out in the 1920s , named after its inventors Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch , can be completed .

As humans , we have really struggled to replicate nature 's photosynthetic process , where a plant transfers simple molecules into others with richer energy content , which is probably the most effective way to storing solar energy .

@@36748762 @5748762/ <h> Why do I need to move my boiler flue ? <h> February 3 , 2016 <p> As I am sure you are aware , building regulations have gotten a lot tighter over the years . At one time you could put your boiler almost anywhere in the home , no problem . These days , there are some very strict rules an installer has to follow , which sometimes mean that the position of the boiler has to change , or the flue altered . In this blog , I want to give you a run-down of some of the important points that these regulations tend to flag up on a new boiler install . <h> Flue Position <p> Openings " Depending on the size of the boiler , the flue must be positioned a certain distance from the nearest window , door , or air brick . Typically this is around 30-60 cm to the side or above the opening , and a bit more if it is below an opening . This is because the waste gasses that are generated by combustion can include dangerous gasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste gas too close to an opening where it might re-enter the home . <p> There are also some less obvious regulations that affect the siting of the flue . It needs to be the same distance away from corners of a building , at least 60cm above flat roofs or balconies , well away from soil or drainpipes , and the eaves . <h> Temperature-sensitive building parts <p> The gas that comes from a flue can be hot , so as well as keeping the flue away from anyone 's skin , the flue should also be sited well away from any materials that could be adversely affected by that heat . For example , the flue should be sited at least 30cm below any plastic guttering . <h> Flue position and property boundary <p> Another thing that has to be borne in mind is the location of the proposed flue relative to the boundary line of the property . This is going to be particularly relevant if your flue goes out directly onto the street . If the flue is within 60cm or so of the boundary line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implications for anyone walking past , so would not be allowed . Generally if the flue must go out onto a wall next to a public walkway , the flue is diverted up above 2.1m to ensure the flue gasses are always above head height . <h> Flues and rooflines <p> There are similar regulations regarding flues that exit at roof level . These regulations are specifically meant to help aid the movement of the flue gas . I wo n't go into detail here , because most flues these days exit horizontally through a wall , although if you have a solid fuel burning appliance , the flue will sometimes exit via the roof . <p> Any flue that goes through the house for any distance will usually end up being concealed in a cabinet or boarded over . Regulations now require access panels to allow access to the flue run at regular intervals , so you may find the addition of little openable panels necessary . <h> If you are keeping your current boiler <p> Remember , just because these regulations mean that a new boiler may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't mean that your old boiler needs to be adjusted . Most of these regulations only apply to new installations , so be very wary if someone servicing your old boiler says that it no longer meets the regulations ' or that it has to be replaced because a new law has come in to effect . Chances are that this is a lie aimed at getting you to install one of their new expensive boilers , when your old one is just fine as it is . <p> The thing to take away here is that , unless you are getting a new boiler , there is unlikely to be any reason to adjust the siting of your current boiler . If you are thinking of getting a new boiler , just remember some of these points and bear them in mind when you are getting someone to quote " it may then be necessary to resite your boiler .

@@36748763 @5748763/ <h> CHP Boilers <h> Heating <h> What are CHP boilers ? <p> Combined heat and power ( CHP ) boilers produce both- heat and electricity in one single process . This process is sometimes referred to as cogeneration and the technology that supports it- has been around since the 1970s , but has mainly been confined to- industry and large- dwellings such as hospitals and sports centres . <p> As the- price of fuel has increased over the last few years , - it now makes economic sense to bring CHP technology into the domestic setting . Not only will a- CHP boiler provide your home with hot water , it will also provide electricity , meaning you could benefit from the Governments- Feed-in Tariff . <p> A micro-CHP boiler- is- defined in the- EU Act on Cogeneration- as a domestic unit- that is- limited to 50kW- of capacity . <h> The different types of CHP boiler <p> There are three types of micro-CHP boiler : <h> The Stirling engine CHP boiler <p> The Stirling engine CHP boiler is a type of- external combustion engine , where the combustion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce the hot water . This heats up the fully enclosed- working gas within the Stirling engine , causing it to expand . The- expansion of the working gas- forces a piston to turn up and down between a copper coil , generating an electrical current , which can then be used in the home . The working gas usually- used in a Stirling engine- is helium , due to its strong heat transfer properties . <p> The main limitation of this type of boiler is that it only produces- electricity- when you have the central heating on , so despite being a very- efficient- type of boiler , it- does not produce an abundance of electricity . A key advantage is that the combustion process involved in a Stirling Engine CHP boiler- is much quieter and more efficient than internal combustion engines . <h> The internal engine CHP boiler <p> This type of CHP boiler is commonly used in large dwellings such as hospitals . It involves using a fuel source to drive a turbine , which is connected to the- electricity generator . The waste heat from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space heating and warm water . This is the most common form of CHP boiler found to date . However the process is noisy and you have far less control over the hot water generated , so fuel cell and the Stirling engine CHP boilers are often preferred . <h> Fuel cell CHP boiler <p> Fuel cell CHP boilers use fuel cells which convert fuel and air directly into power and heat through a quiet , - efficient , solid-state electro-chemical reaction . A- video demonstration of how a fuel cell CHP boiler operates in the home can be found on the- Ceres Power- website . <p> This type of CHP boiler is still in development so is not yet commercially available- on a wide scale . <h> How CHP boilers work in the house <p> A home would typically use a boiler to meet its heating and hot water needs only , and then source its- electricity from the grid. - Central generation wastes a significant proportion of the energy it creates , through heat losses in the power station and in the transmission and distribution network . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for use within the home . This efficiency can save the consumer around 25% of total energy costs ( around- -600 off your bill if you have a typical 3-bed semi-detached house ) , and reduce each- home 's CO2- emissions by up to 1.5 tonnes per annum . Micro-CHP boilers are designed to generate all of the heating and hot water and a significant percentage of- the electricity needed by a typical UK home . <p> The CHP boiler- can use a variety of fuel options including the gas that is supplied by your current provider , but- also- hydrogen , LPG &amp; biofuels . Even during the summer when the home 's central heating system is turned off , the heat produced by the micro-CHP boilers when generating electricity can be stored in a back-up hot water cylinder and then used for domestic hot water . Therefore the micro-CHP boilers are capable of operating all year round , - maximising energy bill savings 365 days a year . <p> Micro-CHP boilers are designed to one day replace your normal condensed boiler , using the same types of connections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A micro-CHP boiler only requires one connection to the electricity network in the house and it 's ready to go ! <h> Industry development <p> Micro-CHP boilers are an example of a microgeneration product for the home . The UK Government has estimated that microgeneration products ( such as micro-CHP boilers ) have the potential to supply over 30% of the country 's total electricity needs and help meet its international environmental obligations , such as the 2020 EU carbon emission reduction targets. - Owning a micro-CHP boiler is one step in the right direction . Full- costs in the- UK- of a micro-CHP boiler including installation- are yet to be made fully transparent ; however incremental cost- estimated in the region of -2,500 to -3,500 versus a condensing boiler , therefore a full installation is then estimated at between -5,000 to -7,000 . <p> Research commissioned by the Government has shown that micro-CHP boilers have the potential to become the micro-generation system of choice ' , replacing the condensing boiler , which is the standard system in most- UK- homes today . Commercial experience has also shown that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term . <p> Currently only the Stirling engine-type micro-CHP boilers have been made available on the domestic market . For example the- Baxi Ecogen- product is one of the few available micro-CHP boilers that is commercially viable and available for the home . The Baxi Ecogen has also been accredited with the- Microgeneration Certification Scheme ( MCS ) , which is important so users can benefit from the- Feed-in tariff- ( FiT ) payments for both generating and exporting electricity . By the middle-end of this decade , the expectation is that fuel cell models such as the- Baxi Gamma 1.0- will be fully available to the UK consumers . <p> When fuel cell micro-CHP technology is commercially available , the consumer should see the price of Stirling engine- models fall . In addition with the- competition in the fuel cell space ( Baxi , Ceres Power , etc ) , this should also make those models commercially competitive . Current evidence suggests that the take-up in UK homes has only been limited , with a lower number of Micro-CHP boilers currently installed- in the UK than expected by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been more widely adopted . <p> Remember micro-CHP boilers are efficient because they generate heat and electricity in one place . They will save you money and help the environment . Currently only the sterling engine type of CHP boilers are available to the residential market ( internal engine CHP boilers are available for large properties ) , but in a few years time fuel cell micro-CHPs will also be available . Micro-CHP boilers are a strategic domestic technology for micro-generation that will help homes with their energy needs , but also help the UK ( and other EU countries ) - meet external carbon emission targets . <h> Benefits <p> CHP boilers are now part of the Feed-in Tariff scheme ( now increased to 12.5p/kWh from 10.5p/kWh , for the first 30,000 residential installs ) . <p> CHP boilers are more environmentally friendly , reducing a typical home 's CO2 ( carbon dioxide ) emissions by up to 1.5 tonnes per annum in the UK . <p> Mounting a CHP boiler can help you reduce your energy costs by 25% or more . <p> Most CHP boiler manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Gas ) who provide installation services . Potential customers should check first with the manufacturer if you would like to arrange their own private installation . 184564 @qwx384564 <p> The payback on the premium , which is the additional cost of a CHP boiler versus a condensing boiler , can pay for itself over the products lifetime . Note : The measurement of payback needs to take into account domestic energy bill savings and Feed-in-Tariff payments for energy generated . Research in this area is not extensive as there are currently only a few commercialised producers of domestic CHP boilers . <h> Cost <p> The full cost of installing a CHP boiler is somewhere between -5,000 to -7,000 , depending on the type of installation and home specification , which is quite a big investment for a typical household . <h> Installing micro CHP <p> Interested in shortly ! <p> Interested in installing a micro CHP boiler ? 184572 @qwx384572 <p> Massive shame about the turn away from domestic CHP market . SOFC has the capability of going fully autonomous and reusing its carbon waste . Electrolysis of water is up to 96% efficient , excess energy produced during the day by solar can be used to electrolyse water and the hydrogen can reform the CO and CO2 wastes into natural gas/ syngas to supplement the gas supply . On a national level , our renewables could be supplementing the gas supply by raising the Hydrogen content to former town gas levels <p> BREAKING NEWS Ceramic Fuel Cells in Germany was acquired by Solid Power on 1st July 2015 , an Italian developer of fuel cell microCHP .

What I want to know is where I can buy a fuel cell CHP unit outright and take the risks and the profit . I am waiting .. mmm . <p> Flow Energy Group has launched their mCHP boiler with a package that actually offsets the entire cost of the boiler with the Feed in Tariff . You pay for installation , take out a monthly finance package to pay for the boiler and flow credits you with an equivalent payment back from the Feed in Tariff . <p> You fail to mention the company already supplying units to various local authorities in Germany , Netherlands and other main land european countries and certified for feed in tarrifs. - Ceramic Fuel Cells ltd . <p> Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updated . Unfortunately despite the enthusiasm for fuel cell boilers in the domestic home being quite high a few years ago , we are probably a few years away now in terms of seeing this solution being widely available .

@@36748764 @5748764/ <h> Should I replace my boiler ? <h> August 14 , 2013 <h> Should I replace my boiler with a new energy efficient model ? <p> This is a question we get all the time from customers . In this blog I intend to show you how to run the numbers to see if it is worthwhile you splashing the cash on a new shiny energy efficient boiler ! <p> You will need- two bits of information to allow you to do this . Firstly , the amount of gas in kWh you use per year . Your utility provider should be able to provide you with this figure , or it might even be on your gas bill ( although to be honest the energy companies make these a bit of a bugger to read ! ) . <p> The other thing you need to do is to determine the energy efficiency of your existing boiler . This is a relatively simple process provided you can find the make and model number of your boiler ( this is normally on the instructions or on the boiler casing- somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SAP2009 annual efficiency rating , which provides you with the efficiency rating of your boiler . <p> You may be surprised to hear that the European Union are still messing about trying to establish some Europe-wide benchmarking mechanism to measure the efficiency of boilers , therefore we have to refer to the SEDBUK boiler efficiency ratings ( which are much more sensible anyway because they simply go A-G rather than have A+ , A++ and A+++ ) . <p> The table can be found on the right , and your boiler should sit somewhere on that scale . So now when someone mentions replacing a G ' rated boiler you actually know what he or she is taking about . <h> Should I replace my boiler now ? <p> So now you know the energy efficiency rating ( both number and banded letter ) and the usage , you can do so simple maths to see what kind of financial savings you would make by installing a new boiler . I am going to take you through a worked example using the following 3 assumptions : <p> Yearly gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Step 1 : Calculate how much useful heat units my current boiler produces per year <p> So my current boiler will turn 15,000kWh of gas into 11790 units of useful heat ( simply calculated by multiplying 15,000 by 0.786 ) . <p> Step 2 : Find out how many equivalent kWh of gas my new boiler would have to burn to produce the same number of units of useful heat <p> 11,790 divided by 0.908 = 12,984 kWh of gas . <p> Step 3 : Calculate how much less gas you are using by installing new boiler <p> 15,000 minus 12,984 = 2016 kWh less units of gas needed <p> Step 4 : Multiply the units of gas saved by the average cost of gas ( 4.5p / kWH ) <p> 2016 kWh x -0.045 = -90.72 per year saving <p> Now an average boiler costs about -2,500 to buy and the estimated lifespan of a boiler is 12 " 15 years . So even if you were to replace this today , you are only looking at saving -1,088 over 15 years from replacing it , based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27,000kWh of gas does that make it worthwhile replacing the boiler ? <p> Old boiler produces 21,222 units of useful heat <p> New boiler needs 23,372 kWh of gas to produce the same amount of heat <p> New boiler saves 3627kWh of gas per year . <p> 3627 kWh x 0.045 = -164.24 per year saving <p> Remember an average boiler costs -2500 to replace , and replacing a D-rated boiler with the A rated boiler detailed above would provide about -1970.88 of savings over the next 12 years ( without factoring in any increases in energy prices over that time ) . You can begin to see that actually it may be worth considering ! <p> The issue is more pronounced however if you are having to pay a yearly sum to keep your boiler alive . Obviously if you are paying -200 a year to get a plumber out to essentially put a plaster on- your boiler to get it through another winter then this it becomes an even more attractive proposition . <p> The key though is to run this calculations for yourself to see if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see that I have taken the average efficiency for each band and run the calculations on the average yearly gas usage in the uk " 17,000kWh , so you should be able to see that from upgrading from a band D boiler to a band A will save you -85 per year will upgrading from a band G to a band A will save you -170 per year . <p> Hopefully the blog above has given you the means to decide whether it is worthwhile replacing your boiler with a new more energy efficient one . As I mentioned earlier though we have not taken into account any fuel price rises in this , so if gas continues to rise at 10% a year then the savings will increase significantly . <p> If you want to give yourself a sense of how much a boiler replacement costs , you may be interested in reading this blog . <p> If you are considering replacing your - boiler ( provided you are based in London ! ) , fill in the form below and we will send one of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get a new boiler installed today from just -1,300 ! 184577 @qwx384577 <p> What are you interested in ? <p> A new boilerAnother type of heating systemA gas safety Certificate 184572 @qwx384572 <h> 43 comments <p> A persons boiler may be the single most important item in the home , particularly around winter , so when it comes to maintaining your boiler or boiler replacement its essential to make sure you get it right . When assessing whether an upgrade is worthwhile or not what it really comes down to is how long will it take to pay for itself so you provide some really useful information which will help many people do so . <p> Hi I have a boiler installed in 1976 never any problems totally reliable . My son has had a condensing boiler installed in 2008 just cost him -600 in repairs in addition to the annual maintenance . Every independent heating engineer I have spoken to recommends not touching keeping my old boiler going for as long as possible . Those trying to sell boilers say the opposite . What is the evidence ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boiler from 1976 will be about 60% efficient where as a new one will be 90% plus . That means that it is 50% more efficient which if you use a fair amount of gas in your home will quickly cover the cost of a new boiler . But absolutely take your point ! New boilers are only intended to last 10-15 years so if you have one you are happy with then keep it ! <p> Its very easy to miscalculate or miss out factors , something which a salesman will almost certainly do in his arithmetic . Do not start with your total gas bill , just the amount of gas used you cant change the standing charge by replacing your boiler . If you intend paying for the new boiler from your savings you need to factor in the loss of interest Calculate the depreciation on the new boiler over its likely life span if itll cost -2400 and have only a 12 year life that 's -200 per year ! A lot you 'd have to save on gas to break even . If the waste heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the kitchen ) you 'll probably have to fit a new radiator there which will add maybe 7-10% to the fuel bill for the new set up . Factor that in too . As I understand it only suitably qualified people can service modern boilers so you may need to factor in the cost of a maintenance contract too ( -100 per year ? ) if you do n't  already have one . In my case my boiler is 40 years old and needs virtually no maintenance . Quite apart from the cost aspect you need to consider whether it is practical . Modern condensing boilers need to be installed on or close to an outside wall to work best . If that ca n't be done then some sort of fan-assisted flue will be needed further cost to install and run . <p> Hi James . Can you advise me please . Just moved house and the gas boiler has broken ( 28yrs old though and was put in when the house was built ) . So I replace with a replacement conventional boiler located in the utility room or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the other double bedroom ? My concerns are noise of a boiler in a bedroom and safety as I plan to put my daughter in there when a little older . I was advised that I could really have a combi put where the other boiler is as this is on the floor and no where else to put it due to window . The conventional boiler would be ok but I have a pump for the shower which is terribly noisy . Oh i just do n't  know what to decide and feel pressured to decide as now have no heating and need to make my mind up quick . Any advice would be so much appreciated please . <p> Hi Janey , The cheapest option for you would be to keep your existing Heat-only system . A combi boiler can be great , but it depends on the water pressure in your home and if there are several bathrooms it might not be up to the job ( as it will split the water if multiple outlets are opened at once e.g. bath tap and kitchen tap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are one of the two brand of boilers to go for . Most important thing is to find a reputable installer that can do it for a good price . Look out for warranty periods on offer ( now usually 5 to 7yrs ) and ask if they are on the approved installer list from that manufacturer . <p> I have an ideal boiler and it is condensing so I guess that makes it quite efficient but it looks old . We have only been in the house for a couple of months but we are planning to move the boiler cause we want to change the kitchen layout . Is it worth getting a plumber just to move this boiler to the new spot or should we get a brand new Worcester Bosch ? Not sure what the additional cost of the boiler is and whether the fact it comes with a new warranty makes it worth doing . Any thoughts ? <p> Hi Chris , Ideal boilers do n't  tend to have a great reputation unfortunately . If the boiler is on the blink it might well be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra -1,500-2,000 to install a new top of the range model , even if you are getting the boiler moved , so its going to be expensive . If you werent changing the position anyway I would say leave it until it packs up , but if you are moving it anyway , its probably worth getting a quote <p> Like some of the other commenters , I was quite surprised how little I would save even with an ancient Worcestor 240. ( 65% efficiency ) Even though it would be around -150 a year , it still does n't  justify the expense of a new boiler . Think I will wait until mine finally conks out or the government offers any more incentive schemes . <p> Anyway , thanks for an excellent article its great to actually go through the numbers and also come out more knowledgable ! <p> Lucky I got an A in maths at school ! This is really helpful though , been looking for a boiler guide like this this all over the web ! Never understood how the numbers works , but looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ! <p> Haha thanks for your comment Simone , you are right it is not that simple , but hopefully if you follow through the workings above you will see whether or not replacing your boiler is worth it and also in doing so what sort energy savings you might be able to expect to achieve . <p> Hi . I have just found this site and hope you can help me . I have a Potterton Puma 80 boiler that a British Gas engineer has just condemned and has arranged for one of their sales men to come and give me an astronomically quote on Friday no doubt . Would I qualify for the -1750+VAT deal advertised here ? What do I do next to get a quote and a new boiler ? I need it gas as I have no heat and soon will have no hot water <p> Was never sure about the adverts that said I would save thousands replacing the boiler and turns out is true . Just -73 based on the workings so will hand on to what Ive got till it breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hi , I was wondering if I go for a combi boiler now whether I would be worse off then trying to get the solar hot water installed at a later date . I am keen to replace the boiler this winter as it is making a lot of noise and my wife is really worried something may happen but at the same time I do n't  have the money to pay for a new solar system . Wondering if anyone can give me some useful advice . <p> Hi Kuzman , so the issue here is that solar thermal will need a hot water tank , while a combi boiler wont ( they heat mains water as and when it is required ) . You may be better off going with a regular heat only boiler and installing this with a dual coil hot water tank this would allow you to go for solar thermal in the future . It is also worth mentioning that solar thermal would never meet all your hot water demands , especially during the winter months , so we would definitely recommend having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a final point , if you did decide to go for solar thermal in the future you would be able to benefit from the renewable heat incentive which would reward you for every unit of hot water produced from the system . <p> Thanks all very useful . Do you know roughly how long it takes for the solar hot water system to payback ? Could I get some Green Deal to help pay towards it ? Sorry to be so demanding for answers I am trying to see if the boiler option is worth going for now . <p> Hi Kuzman , to be honest with solar hot water it varies considerably from case to case . For example , the RHI payments are higher for homes that have more people living there . For example if a house has 4 bedrooms and 6 people live there , the payments would be higher than for the same house if only 2 people lived there . <p> A solar thermal system would cost around 3k to install and if you had maximum occupancy ( i.e. 6 people living in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs over the 7 years through the RHI , however solar thermal will only provide all your hot water during the summer months , so the actual energy savings are n't  enormous . <p> Hi James , this is absolutely true ! if you are looking to go for solar thermal in the near future and you are about to swap your boiler now , then you would be foolish to look past a heat only boiler with the dual coil hot water tank that would allow you to connect the solar thermal system further down the line . This is a very useful article by the way , thanks for sharing it . <p> Hi Leslie , it is unlikely that you will be able to claim GDHIF when you just want to replace the boiler unfortunately . We know that the Flue gas recovery system has now been removed , so it is likely that you will need to take the boiler + something else to get the grant . <p> Having said that the Government may now choose to offer heating controls as the second measure or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who just want to swap boilers out much like the -400 boiler scrappage scheme from a few years ago . <p> James , Thanks so much for replying . You have obviously taken some time to think about my flat ! -200 a year does seem quite a lot , I think you might be overestimating my usage slightly . I have looked at some combi options and the cost seems to be about -3,000+ , so is the payback really worth it ? Its going to take me at least 15 years to pay back is n't it ? <p> I 'm in California at the moment , but I will definitely have a look at a new boiler when I get back , I 'm just not 100% convinced that those savings are going to make it worthwhile . Thanks for your help and maybe you can convince me otherwise <p> Hi Harry , thanks for your comment so the potterton netaheat is only 65% efficient to be honest this is as low as the efficiency goes in the SEDBUK database ( all boilers are considered to have an efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The boilers final year of manufacture was 1988 , so I also think you are approaching the time where you are going to struggle to find parts for the boiler if things go wrong . <p> In terms of specific savings on your heating bills , since you have n't provided you annual energy usage I cant give you an accurate annual saving , but if you heating bill was 15,000kWh ( which is about right for a 2 bed flat ) then you are looking at a saving of about -200 a year ( in theory you should save about 4260kWh of gas each year ) . <p> Obviously if you have a warm winter , you will probably use less gas and if the winter is cold then you will use more gas . Remember too that a new boiler installed by a good heating engineer will also come with a minimum 5 year warranty which is nice to have too since if anything goes wrong in that time you can call them out . <p> I would have thought replacing my boiler would save me lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I first thought . How much do you think I would save by changing my old potterton netaheat 10 to a new model ? I live in a 2 bed flat . Thanks ! <p> I have a ideal Mexico 2 boiler and i got it serviced by a british gas engineer about 4 years ago . He said that it was worth replacing because parts would now be difficult to come by . To be honest it has been going 30 years now and it still works fine . The new boilers only last 10 years so if you have one of the older ones that keeps going and going then do n't  replace it in my opinion . <p> We have an Ideal Mexico 2 as well , still going strong at 72% efficiency . We use 27000kwh of gas a year and with EDF Blue Price+ March2017 , were paying just under 2p per kwh plus 26p a day standing charge inc VAT . Assuming a new boiler is 92% efficient , this will save us a grand total of -111 per year ! Were sticking with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an interesting comment , we certainly see a lot of boilers this sort of age in houses . I guess the key here is the efficiency of that specific boiler and how much gas you actually use to heat your home . If you use a lot of gas , then it may make sense to swap it out , but I completely take your point that new boilers do n't  have the same sort of lifespan . It would be interesting for you to follow the advice above and see what kind of energy savings you would expect . The other thing is that replacing a floor mounted boiler is not going to be as cheap as swapping a combi boiler for example they do n't  really do many floor mounted boilers anymore and it depends where the flue is located , it is likely that their is going to need to be some pipework alternations . All of these things might increase the cost for you unfortunately . <p> I thought I had very efficeint boiler , but appears that even though i have a combi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were condensing anyway appears not ! I think running your calculations above I would only save about -85 a year , but it is more that the boiler has started making funny noises , so I think it is time to make the switch .

They will cost a little more , but by paying a little extra you can a really long warranty on both these types of boiler so in our opinion worth doing over paying British Gas Homecare or equivalent . <p> I am still thinking about going air source heat pump or new gas boiler , but this article sets out well what I should look at . What manufacturer would you recommend a good boiler ? The price of -1750+VAT does that include the labour or is that just for the boiler . Do I need a gas safety check every year for the warranty ? Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are neutral on this . <p> -1750 + VAT should be all in Grant , and as I said to Tomas , Worcestor and Vaillant our currently our favourites . A yearly gas safe check is a legal requirement if renting the property , but this does not normally have an impact on the warranty that is not to say we do n't  think it is a good idea getting one though ! <p> My boiler is 12 years old and having taken a look using the link above is only 73% efficient . My gas usage looks high enough to make it worthwhile I think , especially if I can get a decent warranty on the new boiler . Any recommendations of brands to go ? which have suggested Worcestor , but my neighbour has a baxi and says it is very good ? <p> Thank you for writing this it really is wonderfully useful . I was sure that my boiler was out of date , but actually was shocked to find it is still running at 86% efficiency , therefore it certainly does n't  make sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you ! ! 
@@36748765 @5748765/ <h> Energy Companies and the Smart Grid <h> Energy companies and the smart grid <p> Rolling out the smart grid should help keep the lights on in Britain , reducing the threat of blackouts while hopefully providing value for money for consumers . <p> Aside from helping the country transition to a low carbon energy industry , it will also benefit the energy companies through a variety of means that we look at in detail below . <h> Advantages of the smart grid for the energy companies <h> Levelling of demand <p> One of the key implications of the smart grid for the energy companies is that it will allow them to dampen peak demand . As mentioned elsewhere , the electricity produced during periods of peak demand is the most expensive and least efficient . A smart grid would aim to reduce this demand and lower the extent of demand at peak times . Having a more stable supply and demand will result in a more efficient generation of electricity for the suppliers that will obviously be cheaper for them to operate . <p> In addition , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart appliances allows them to better manage supply and demand . For example turning off the fridge for 2 hours in the afternoon will have no impact on the temperature inside the fridge if it does n't get opened . If the fridge were turned off the consumer would save a little on their energy bills , and if at any point it were opened it would turn on again . Giving the energy companies the ability to do this would obviously allow them to more accurately manage the grid . <h> Cutting administration costs <p> The introduction of the smart meter , and the 2-way dialog system of communications , means that instead of sending thousands of employees out to take meter readings across the country , information about electrical usage is automatically sent in real-time . This dramatically cuts admin costs , which increases profit . <h> Charging customers in a more effective manner <p> Time of use tariffs will be the utility companies ' way of reducing peak demand and levelling off usage over time . By using these tariffs , the supplier puts itself in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand , they can charge more per kWh . However , if people start using less energy during traditionally peak times , and use more during periods of reduced demand , then the utility companies no longer have to fund the operation of highly inefficient electricity generators in order to maintain enough capacity . <h> Reliable electricity transmission <p> Due to frequent expansions of the current national grid and the complex network of cables running up and down the country , electrical transmission is often complicated and as a result inefficient . Electricity travels down the path of least resistance . However , due to the size of the grid at present , electricity often oscillates , sometimes causing- power outages . The smart grid , with its distribution intelligence , aims to increase efficiency within the transmission of electricity through its improved technological communications and information processes . <h> Lessening environmental impact from energy generation <p> One of the key objectives put to the energy firms is to reduce their carbon footprint . Electricity generation during peak demand times is extremely harmful to the environment , since inefficient power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , if the extent of peak times were to be reduced then electricity generation would be more efficient , and as a result less environmentally damaging . <p> On top of this is the integration of the renewable sector within the electrical generation mix . With a grid that 's more accepting towards sustainable energy sources , comes a grid that is more environmentally-focused , with a reduced carbon footprint and lower carbon emissions . <h> Reducing transmission distances <p> The increased integration of renewables into the grid not only decreases carbon emissions , but also amplifies the number of electricity generation points across the country . This enables the grid to power homes using electricity generated within close proximity , reducing the risk of transmission losses , creating a more efficient electrical network . <h> Swift power outage detection <p> Currently , if an area loses power then the only way utility companies find out about it is through consumer telephone calls . However , the new smart grid aims to create a system that is entirely self-healing by rerouting electricity and , to a certain extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduces the possibility of power outages as well as increasing the time it takes to repair them . <h> Kill switch <p> If someone in the present day does not pay any electricity bill for a prolonged period of time , there is no way the utility companies can stop the property using more . However , the smart grid brings with it a remote kill switch on every that smart metered property . This is a huge advantage for the suppliers as they can remotely cut off any transmission of electricity to any property. - So make sure you pay your bills , otherwise you may have to stock up your supply of candles . <h> The cost of implementing the smart grid <p> The capital cost of installing and improving the current grid to smart grid capacity has been rumoured to be at least -12 billion . This money has to come from somewhere and in order to maintain already struggling customer relations , utility companies may have to fund it without charging the consumers . While not all -12billion will come from utility companies , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is scope for them to make this money back through the increased efficiency of the grid .

@@36748767 @5748767/ <h> Megaflo unvented hot water systems <h> Heating <p> We are seeing more and more people installing Megaflo heating systems in their homes , but what are they and why are they becoming so popular ? Well , a Megaflo is essentially a brand of hot water tank but the major difference is how they are plumbed in . <p> Older , traditional heat only systems have cold water expansion tanks up in the roof , and it is the height of this cold water tank above the hot water cylinder that generates the pressure that delivers the hot water to the taps . For taps on the lower floors , this tends to work perfectly , but for bathrooms upstairs the pressure is often not great and so you get issues like weak showers or baths that take an age to fill up . In many cases , this is sorted by installing a pump that drives the water from the hot water tank to the required faucet , but installing a Megaflo does away with all these issues ! <h> Megaflo an unvented hot water cylinder <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " this is pressurised to mains water pressure , ensuring a strong flow of hot water when you turn a tap on in the home , regardless of where it is located . The actual pressure in this type of hot water cylinder is normally about 3 bar , which is equivalent to a cold water tank being 30m above the tap for a heat-only system . The cold water is fed into the bottom of the tank at mains pressure . This forces the hot water out at the top and this then travels to the tap . This means that you have great pressure all the time , so gone are the days of the dreaded dripping shower ! <p> Since the volume of water increases as it gets heated , all unvented systems require some sort of expansion vessel to absorb this increased volume . The nice thing about the Megaflo models is that they contain an enclosed air bubble within the tank itself , which acts as the expansion vessel so you do n't require an external one . Its worth mentioning , though , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water ; this can be recharged as part of an annual boiler service . <p> Like other heating systems , the hot water within the Megaflo can be produced by immersion units ( so heated with electricity ) , boilers or even solar thermal . If you buy a twin-coil unit , you can feed the tank with two sources of hot water : a boiler plus solar thermal , for example . <p> Although there are lots of hot water tanks suitable for use within unvented systems , the Megaflo is the market leader in the UK . This is partly because the brand , but the performance of these cylinders really is very good . They are tested to withstand 15 bar of pressure , so you can be sure they are up to the job of operating at these higher pressures ( compared to conventional heat-only systems ) . <h> Megaflo cylinders have lots of safety features <p> Megaflo cylinders also have great safety features incorporated into them . This includes thermostatic controls that prevent the water in the cylinder ever being heated above 100 degrees centigrade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take place if the cylinder does n't perform correctly . There is also a temperature and pressure release valve situated on top of the tank , which vents water if it hits unsafe temperature levels . Megaflo cylinders also include a 60mm-thick layer of polyurethane foam to insulate them . This ensures that once the hot water is created it stays warm for longer , minimising the need to reheat the water . <p> So having looked at the advantages of the Megaflo cylinders , what are the issues with them ? Well , not many performance-wise , however they are significantly more expensive than other unvented cylinders . <p> Unvented systems are also generally more expensive to install compared to heat-only boilers . They must be installed by a competent and qualified- G3 engineer ; this is a- legal requirement in the UK- and all installations must be certified and registered with the local council . This means that your average plumber/heating engineer will not actually be allowed to install one in your home . <p> The other issue and this is not just Megaflo , but all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if everything is working correctly then the performance will be great , but all pipework needs to be able to withstand the higher pressures ! <p> The performance of the Megaflo cylinders makes them extremely popular " the hot water is delivered to every tap at mains pressure and the tanks themselves are well insulated , ensuring they operate very efficiently " but be prepared to pay more to install- one of these in your home ! <h> Installing- a new Megaflo <p> Are you interested in installing a Megaflo ?

Thank you <p> Hi Bill , we always recommend getting your boiler checked on a yearly basis . Having a yearly gas safe certificate is a legal requirement when you rent your property and we do think this is good practise for any household to be honest , so that is the time to get the megaflo checked . <p> I have recently had the hot and cold pipes rerouted and now can not get hot water produced by the boiler but can using the immersion heater .

What size of Megaflow you recommend and what is approx. cost of the material and also the total cost with installation . The flat is located in Wimbledon . <p> Hi , We have a conventional gravity fed water system and an old ( faithful ) Glow Worm Fuelsaver F boiler in our 4 bedroom 2 bath house .

Any ideas ? Brendon <p> Hi Brendon a megaflow ( system boiler ) should have fixed pressure the water coming in from the mains at the bottom of the tank expels the warm water at the top of the tank . There really should be no pressure drop at all so definitely worth getting a heating engineer round to discuss . <p> My son has recently had such a system fitted . He is under the impression that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unable to do both simultaneously Is this the case ? If so this is inconvenient particularly the morning when showers are required . Please advise . <p> Why would you want to install an unvented mains pressure water system when you can get the same results from a vented mains water system , but with none of the expense or risks ( danger ) associated with using an unvented system ? <p> You do yourself no good by publishing a website that is carrying outdated information . <p> Hi Mike , unvented are extremely popular nowadays because the flow is much better because it comes out at mains pressure where as the vented systems are gravity fed . If people are installing new systems from scratch then we would always suggest an unvented system over a heat only vented system the cost is not that much more and they have a huge number of safety features ( installers need additional accreditation ) . <p> Please also let us know which information is outdated and we will look to update it .

If you boiler has packed up , try installing a renewable heating technology and the best bit , you get paid to produce the hot water by the Government ! <p> Draught proof around your front door ( including the letter box ) to help prevent cold air rushing into your home during the winter months . <p> Shower do n't  bath ! Baths tend to use a huge amount of- hot water compared to a shower <p> Limit the length of the shower ( related to No.5 ) we know sometimes that nothing beats standing under the shower for ages , but if you can try and keep these extended stays- to a minimum you are going to save energy and reduce your bills ( especially if you are on metered water ) <p> Shut windows during the winter . Maybe a bit obvious , but if the heating is on and you are letting all the hot air escape straight out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Install heavy curtains and make sure you close them at night , this again acts as a barrier to prevent heat loss out of the home . <p> Install chimney balloons- or a chimney sheep both work in the same way to stop cold draughts come down the chimney , just remember they are up there before you relight the fire ! <p> With a regular boiler " turn down the thermostat on the hot water tank . This will mean the water in the tank never gets too warm . There is little point producing scalding hot water in the tank if you then simply add cold water in your mixer shower or bath to get it to a nice comfortable temperature . Making sure it is heated to the right temperature ( and stored at the right temperature too ) in your hot water tank is a great way to save on your heating bill and this is done by turning down the thermostat on the tank . <p> Insulate your hot water cylinder . If you have a hot water tank in your house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store to pick up a jacket to- help limit heat loss . <p> Install double or triple glazing- it is never that cheap to do , but it will improve the thermal comfort of your home and should save you a little bit on your energy bills every year . <p> Turn down the roomstat by a couple of degrees . 19 degrees is about the norm here in the UK , some people do like there homes a bit warmer but as a rule of thumb for every degree you turn your thermostat down you will save about -50 . <p> Open windows instead of using the extractor fan no electricity used , no cost ! <p> Set your fridge / freezer to a higher temperature so they do n't need to work so hard and if you are defrosting food , always defrost it in the fridge because then the frozen food will keep the fridge cooler ! <p> Replace your lighting with low energy LED lights , they not only use 90% less energy but they also last- 10-20 times longer so you will hardly ever have- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the winter to keep your house warm ( keep curtains open in daytime " maximise direct light entering the house ) . <p> Only buy A-rated appliances or above , they are marginally more expensive , but in most cases the additional energy savings will cover the additional expense in just a year or two . <p> Use motion detector lights there is no point leaving lights on if no-one is there to benefit from them . Motion detector lights are also a good deterrent against unwanted visitors . <p> Use microwaves to reheat food as opposed to the oven they heat up the food far quicker so are therefore more efficient . <p> Repair refrigerator door seals . If warm air is seeping into the fridge then it will need to work harder ( and use more electricity in the process ) to keep it at the set temperature . <p> Fill your freezer up " it uses less energy since the frozen food wont warm up when the door is opened .

It is definitely worth it , especially if you have n't made the swap to LED lights ( see no.17 ! ) <p> Avoid using the dryer " hang clothes outside when you can . Dryers have big motors to spin the clothes and heaters to help the drying process which means they are expensive bits of kit to run . If you can hang clothes outside you can normally get away without ironing them too because the wind does the work for you ! <p> If you do use a dryer " clean the lint filter after every couple of uses " this will help it run more efficiently helping to save electricity <p> Try and maximise the use of the BBQ during the summer months " and use waste wood !

These are especially useful if you are on a water meter . <p> If your washing machine does n't have a half load setting " make sure you fill it with clothes <p> Plug things into a power strip and turn that off at the plug when not in use to avoid leaving things in standby .

Better still , - install a smart thermostat- which you can control from your home . This will allow you to turn the heating on and off from wherever you are in the world , so if you suddenly realise you left the heating on while sitting on the sun bed in the Costa Del Sol you can turn it off to minimise wastage . <p> Try to avoid electric heating " electricity is 4x the price of gas .

This- will limit the amount of cooling you need to do in your home e.g. air conditioning or a fan . <p> If you have a ceiling fan , it should blow down in the winter and up in the summer , so you will need to turn the blades around to achieve this . <p> On the loft hatch , ensure you attach insulation to the top of it , and then create a seal with draught proofing around the perimeter .

The price of oil is under $30 dollars yet there have been no price drops . Surely that would be the biggest way to save energy at home if the energy companies passed on these savings . Instead I bet when oil prices do go up they will continue to increase prices and neglect to mention they are at the lowest levels for over a decade .

It is very simple , but every Sunday we cook most of the meals for the week . Not only does it save time when you get home from work in the evening but also we save energy ! Can also cook in bulk i.e. rice to last the week and then frdige everything and use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after use ( with the minimum amount of water for next brew ) . That way waste heat in the kettle will pre-heat the cold water from the tap . <p> 2 ) If you have a hot water tank / thermostat / timer then set the water to come on about an hour before use . That way the water in the tank will be it at its hottest when needed , the water thermostat may be turned down and a hot tank wont be left to cool down overnight . ( This needs a bit of fettling to get the settings right ) . <p> 3 ) With conventional boiler + hot water tank set the boiler thermostat about 15C above the water tank thermostat . Any less and there is insufficient difference to heat the water . Any more and the water at the top of the water tank will be too hot .

Store electric oil filled radiators somewhere warm so that they heat up quicker . Proper coffee and some teas like lower temperature water , race the kettle to switch it off or get one that heats to 70C . Check how many watts all of your AV off that one socket is using when on standby . Charge your mobile phone and cycle lights up at work . Convince everyone in the family to sport short hair : quicker showers and no hair dryers , straighteners etc . <p> Turn off the pilot light in your HVAC or boiler during warm/hot months . Not recommended is you get domestic hot water from your boiler. = BTW if you cant seem to find a pilot light , you probably do not have one . <p> I remember a tip to put a filled water bottle in the toilet tank . For example , a full 500 ml. bottle will have the toilet buffer 500ml water less , saving 1 litre every two full flushes . Simple trick nicely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing at night , this allows the moisture to soak in feeding the roots all night and reduces the risk of scorching the leaves . Also in biodynamics they believes that at night the earth breaths in and during the day breaths out . Which sort of makes sense when you think about it . <p> Energy can be saved by using dual flush cistern and save -20/person/year on the water meter . Its a free DIY to convert a single 12l flush to an optional 6l flush by fixing a rubber hose to the siphon with the height of the free end controlled by the handle . <p> I like this article as I really shows how many ways there are to save energy at home , some of them many of us probably do not realize .

Obviously rolling out the smart grid also raises a few areas of contention for consumers and we also look at these . <h> Advantages of the smart grid for the customer <h> Empowering the consumer <p> The smart grid will give the consumer the potential to save money ; however this is very much dependant on the consumer acting on the information available to them .

Real-time consumption will display up-to-the-minute information on how much electricity is being used and at what price . <h> The end of estimated bills <p> The smart grid allows the energy companies to see energy usage from individual houses in real time if they so require , so they should be able to bill exactly the right amount each month . No more overpaying during the summer and getting whacked with sudden additional payments when they finally get actual energy usage details from the meter . <h> Electrical reliability/swifter power outage detection <p> Due to the increase of data available within the smart grid , power outages , or blackouts , can be predicted and sometimes even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems to quickly be fixed , potentially even before customers are even aware of the issue . This obviously creates a more reliable electricity network that should mean power failures become a thing of the past . <h> Lower carbon footprint <p> The smart grid through initiatives like the time of usage tariff should help lower peak energy demand , meaning less generating capacity will be needed . This should result in lower carbon emissions since fewer old fossil fuel electricity generators are required to be switched on . <p> The improved integration of renewables inside the grid also helps minimise carbon emission within the UK 's electrical generation mix . <h> Remotely monitored usage <p> The introduction of the smart meter within the smart grid system means that utility companies no longer have to pay the high admin fees involved with checking meter readings .

We now have millions of micro power stations that are all producing unpredictable amounts of energy . <p> The introduction of the smart grid allows the increased integration of renewables energy in to our energy mix . This will reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels , relieving us from these volatile markets . Not only will it save the consumer money , but also lower the carbon footprint of the grid and therefore consumers are safe in the knowledge that the electricity that they use is as green as can be and that it is being produced here in the UK , with no need to import fuels . <h> Disadvantages for the consumer resulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installation passed on <p> The upfront capital cost of installing smart meters nationwide- is quite frightening , with reports coming from governmental sources suggesting that it may be close to -12billion .

One of the key concepts of the smart grid is that it will aim to level off the peaks and troughs in electricity demand .

@@36748772 @5748772/ <h> Desalination <h> Renewables <p> There is an estimated 300m miles3- of water present on the earth . Of this , 96% is found in oceans , - another 2% of water is tied up in glaciers and ice caps , and 1% sits in the atmosphere . This leaves only 1% of the water present on earth available for human and animal consumption , and even a large percentage of this is inaccessible . Demand is growing as a direct result of an increasing population and increased economic development , and has tripled over the last 50 years alone . To cater for this increasing demand desalination may be the only answer in the years to come . <h> What is desalination ? <p> Desalination describes a range of processes which are used to reduce the amount of dissolved solids in water . It is most often used to describe the process of converting salt water ( e.g. sea water ) to fresh water that can then be used for drinking ( potable water ) and irrigation . Used for sometime on ships and submarines , this process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in areas where it is currently limited . <p> Large scale desalinisation plants tend to use large amounts of energy to produce the water as well as costly infrastructure , therefore when compared to drawing fresh water from rivers and groundwater , desalinated water is very expensive . However , you tend to find desalination plants associated with electricity generating plants , from which electricity and waste heat are readily available making them more cost effective . This combined use of resources is explored more in- CHP cogeneration . <p> The quantity of dissolved solids in a liquid is known as total dissolved solids ( TDS ) and is measured in mg/l . Typically sea water has a TDS value of over 30,000mg/l , while drinking water sits within the range of 0-1000mg/l . <h> What are some of the desalination techniques ? <p> There are many techniques involved in desalination , each with their own advantages and disadvantages , but broadly speaking most techniques sit within two camps . <p> 1 . Thermal distillation evaporating the pure water from salt water using heat . The processes that fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more detail : a ) multistage flash distillation , b ) multiple effect distillation , c ) vapour compression and d ) solar **31;0;TOOLONG <p> 2 . The use of semi permeable membranes processes explored that fall in this category are reverse osmosis and electro-dialysis reversal . <h> Desalination using Multistage Flash Distillation <p> Approximately 85% of desalination worldwide is completed by multi-stage flash distillation ( MSF ) " this is a type of thermal desalination . This process involves distilling sea water by flashing a portion of the water into steam in multiple evaporating chambers ( known as stages ) of what are essentially counter current heat exchanges . The process is as follows . <p> The sea water enters the system , and via heat exchanges it is heated as the water travels through the top of each of the main evaporating chambers ( stages ) . <p> Eventually , once the water has travelled through all of the stages , it enters a brine heater which heats it up further to the optimum temperature for the process to take place ( heating it first in the evaporating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This water then enters the first stage , where lower ambient pressure causes the seawater to instantaneously boil , releasing heat and water vapour until reaching equilibrium with the conditions in the chamber . <p> This water then enters the next stages one after another , where successively lower ambient pressure in each of these causes the seawater to again instantaneously boil as soon as it enters without reheating each time . <p> The vapour from each of the stages is condensed against the heat exchanger tubes ( with the heat being used in step 1 ) , creating the freshwater which is pumped away and then the remaining brine enters the next stage and this process gets repeated . <p> The sea water increases in salt concentration from stage to stage as distilled water leaves the solution . This can simply be pumped back into the original source . <h> Desalination using reverse osmosis <p> Another popular method for desalination is reverse osmosis , which involves the use of a semi-permeable membrane . Osmosis is a phenomenon used by plants to absorb water and move it within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solvent across a semi-permeable membrane into a solution of higher solute concentration . It results in equilibrium being met , where the two solutions on each side of the membrane have equal solutes . The difference in the concentrations is known as osmotic pressure , and the higher this is , the quicker the solvent will move . This process can be reversed if the pressure applied to solution with the greater solute concentration is higher than the osmotic pressure . <p> In reverse osmosis , pressure is applied to the feedwater , forcing the water molecules through a semi-permeable membrane . The water that has passed through the membrane leaves the unit as product water , and most of the dissolved impurities remain behind and are discharged in a waste stream . <p> There are however major problems associated with this , firstly the process is very slow , and the membranes are very delicate so can tear easily . In addition the water needs to be filtered first so that large particles do n't damage the membrane , and additives may need to be added to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two methods account for most of desalination that takes place across the world . There are other methods which are described very briefly below . <h> Desalination using Multiple Effect Distillation <p> In multiple-effect distillation , evaporators are situated in series , so the energy in the steam from one series is used to evaporate water in the next one . The saline water is usually applied to evaporator tubes in the form of a thin film so that it will evaporate easily . <h> Desalination using Vapour Compression <p> The technique of vapour compression uses a mechanical energy source , such as an engine or electric motor , to power a compression turbine . The feedwater is evaporated and the turbine compresses this raising the temperature of the exhaust vapour . The vapour is then passed over a heat exchanging condenser , where it returns to the liquid state as product water . The heat removed during condensation is returned to the raw water to assist in the production of more vapour . <h> Desalination using Electrodialysis Reversal ( EDR ) <p> In EDR , an electrical current is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Most of the impurities in water are present in an ionized ( electrically charged ) state and will conduct electric current . When direct current is applied , the impurities migrate towards the positive and negative electrodes ; these ions are pulled through a semi permeable membrane resulting in two streams , a desalinated stream ( which is tapped off as potable water ) and a salt water stream . These membranes can become blocked by ions and other impurities ; however by reversing the current the solutes that attach themselves to the membrane dissolve back into the water , so this combats efficiency reductions . However , this process is only possible for brackish water ; it does not work effectively on purifying seawater . Click- here- for an- EDR example . <h> Desalination using Solar **31;33;TOOLONG Method <p> This process mimics the natural water cycle , however takes place over a much shorter period . The simplest example is using a solar still , where the sun enters a glass covered box heating water held in the bottom of the box ( which is black to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to evaporate , and this then condenses on the glass cover where it gets collected . More sophisticated designs separate the solar heat gain section from the evaporation-condensation chamber . An optimised design comprises separated evaporation and condensation sections . <h> Thermal distillation vs semi permeable membranes for desalination <p> The performance of distillation technologies is relatively unaffected by feedwater salinity <p> Distillation technologies have a higher total energy consumption than membranes <p> For low salinity feedwater , membrane technologies have a higher rate of recovery <p> Reverse Osmosis requires pre-treatment before the desalination process , in which all solid and suspended particles are removed , its pH value is adjusted and appropriate chemical inhibitors are added to ensure scale deposits <p> Distillation suffers from higher rates of corrosion and scale formation due to the higher temperatures involved . <h> Desalination industry development <p> The scarcity of fresh water is already critical in many arid regions of the world and this will increase in importance in the future . It is also highly likely that the availability of fresh water ( along with fossil fuels ) will be a determining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the International Desalination Association in 2009 there were over 14,000 desalination plants , producing- 60million m3/day of potable water .

Conversely combi boilers create hot water on demand , so there are no heat loss issues with these . <h> Condensing regular boiler <p> As with the other types of boiler , any open vent boiler bought today will be a condensing open vent boiler , and will capture the latent heat in the exhaust fumes of the boiler with a heat exchanger , so less fuel is used to produce the same amount of heat . <h> Regular boilers with solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compatible with solar thermal solutions .

One lux is equivalent to one lumen per square meter . They differ from lumens , which measure the- brightness of the light source . <p> 1 LUX = 1 Lumen / m2 <p> What does this actually mean for you ? Well imagine you buy a 400 lumen bulb and put it in a room with 10m2 of surface area inside . A little toilet or store room for example . Putting that into our equation , the room is therefore on average getting a light intensity of 40 lux .

@@36748776 @5748776/ <h> Thermostatic Radiator Valves ( TRVs ) <h> Heating <h> What are thermostatic radiator valves ( TRVs ) ? <p> Thermostatic radiator valves are commonly referred to as TRVs and are used to control the air temperature of different rooms " you will normally find them on the side of your radiators . <p> TRVs are just one of a number of heating controls , which allow homeowners to heat their homes more efficiently . If set up correctly , they allow you to have different heating zones throughout the house , despite only one centralised boiler providing the heat . <h> How does a TRV work ? <p> The TRV is a self-regulating valve that works by changing the flow of hot water into a radiator . It consists of two parts , the valve head and the valve body , with the head sitting atop the body . When the room temperature changes , a capsule in the valve head contracts or expands , which moves a pin in the valve body causing it either to open or close . <p> If it gets too warm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pin to close the valve " slowing the movement of hot water into the radiator . Likewise , if the room drops in temperature , contraction of the capsule in the valve head pulls the pin out , allowing hot water to enter the radiator once more . <p> There tends to be two materials used in the TRV capsules " wax or liquid . On the whole , liquid models are generally considered to be better and their price reflects this . One of their advantages is their responsiveness to changes in temperature " while the wax one is relatively slow to expand or contract , the liquid capsule will change the flow of water into the radiator far more quickly . <h> Costs of TRVs <p> A TRV will cost you about -10 " 30 each . The Drayton TRV4 for example , which is a liquid capsule TRV and is considered one of the best costs -20 from Screwfix . <h> Where not to use a TRV <p> There are two places that you really should n't install TRVs on the radiators " the first is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath/shower will cause the TRV to shut off ( it will cause the capsule to expand ) , just when you need the heat from the radiator to fight off condensation . <p> We also do n't advise installing a TRV in the same room as your main heating thermostat . The main thermostat will link directly to the boiler , firing it up or turning it down , so by having a TRV in that room they will fight for control " if the TRV wins , the heating in your house will go off ! <h> Newer electronic TRVs <p> Nowadays you can take zonal heating control a step further with electronic TRVs ( for example Honeywell 's Evohome system ) . These electronic TRVs use batteries and electronic thermostats to constantly monitor the temperature of the room and move the pin up and down accordingly . <p> They can also be used with the other heating control components to create an intelligent heating system like the Heat Genius system .

It is also worth checking once a year that the pin in the valve body is still moving freely ( these sometimes get stuck ) . <p> To do this , unscrew the valve head off the body " this should reveal the pin that moves up and down controlling the flow of water into the radiator . A spring should hold the pin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't move when you push it , you may need to replace the whole valve assembly . <h> 4 comments <p> I disagree with your statement that liquid elements in TRVs are generally considered to be better than wax . It depends on the manufacturer and design . What people should be looking out for when purchasing TRVs are the approvals and ratings . An EN215 standard marking shows the product has been tested and performs to a high standard . Also the best TRVs have an A rated Tel rating , much like kitchen appliances . You do n't  have to buy an expensive TRV to get these high standards , but generally the nicer looking designs cost a bit more .

The insulation will minimise heat loss in the winter , saving you money on your heating bills . It will also stop your home getting too warm in the summer , helping to- keep your home at a more comfortable temperature . <p> According to research , twice as much heat could be lost through an un-insulated solid wall as through an un-insulated cavity wall .

The green deal is finance mechanism . Some installers do offer some grants via the Eco Scheme though , but you will still need to pay the majority of the cost of the works . <p> Internal insulation MUST have a continuous Vapour barrier or there is high risk of Interstitial condensation in the wall structure or on the face touching the insulation . If the latter then there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage . <p> This is a point often omitted in comments relating to internal insulation . <p> Hi Margaret , there are still a few councils offering grants under the Green Deal community fund . There is still also partial funding via ECO , although that will only cover about 10 20% of the cost of the works . <p> We have recently had external wall insulation installed primarily to make the property look like new again however this was done on the basis that the internal cavity wall insulation had to be removed this being standard practice for all of the houses in our area choosing to have this done under a government subsidised scheme even though to us there was nothing wrong with the then existing cavity wall insulation having lived in the house for over 20 years . All that was done was a initial internal inspection to establish if we had cavity wall insulation which was confirmed following which it was removed with no reason being given for its removal + we have never experienced any problems with dampness , lack of warmth etc . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is actually colder than with the cavity wall insulation and we know we are not the only ones as some neighbours have also stated this having had the same work done by the same company handling the project in our area . I would like to ask therefore , would the overall insulation not have been more effective / efficient if the cavity wall insulation had been left intact as we would then have had a layer from outside to inside made up as follows : Rendering , poly brick , thin air gap , original rendering , brick , cavity insulation , brick , plasterboard as opposed to what we now have being : Rendering , thin air gap , poly brick , original rendering , brick , big cavity air gap previously filled , brick , plasterboard . My argument is that we now have a layer of cold air between the house bricks fed by the air bricks around the house therefore in effect we only now have one brick and a layer of plasterboard between the inside of the house and the cold outside air which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having no effect as the air temperature is now balanced between what 's outside and the air gap between the house bricks . Should not the original cavity wall insulation have been left in place with the external insulation then added which then in effect would have been a much thicker wall between the outside and inside of the house ? ? ? ? ? ? In addition to this we also had to have a new boiler installed as the exhaust we were told by the company was not up to spec and with work due to start within a few days I had insufficient time to search for a replacement or have one made therefore another contractor was appointed by us who could complete the work in time however this did add considerable cost to the project but perhaps worthwhile as we now burn more gas to heat the house . <p> In my view the energy savings are more a secondary issue of using an insulated render system like the one talked about in the article above . We had our home insulated under a government green deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ render looked awful and so we thought it was time to get it redone . Having been through the process and had the insulation installed , over the past few colder days you can really feel the difference . The house does stay much warmer , but actually for me personally I am just thrilled with the finish that has been acheived . The house is an end terrace so we have three external walls and the existing render had cracked everywhere . The company who installed this new insulated render system took just 10 days and it had completely transformed our home . I would really strongly recommend people to look at doing this especially if you want to escape the dreaded pebble dash finish of the 60s and 70s . <p> My one piece of advice to those looking to get solid wall insulation on their homes is to research the company that have had it done becuase a few properties on our street did it and the quality of finish is different between different installers so make sure you see some previous examples of their work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are seeing more and more people who are using solid wall insulation as a means of improving the visual appearance of their homes . While for us , the thermal performance improvement is the main thing , I do appreciate that homes can often look a lot better following the works ! Also completly agree with your final comment finding a good installer is absolutely key badly installed solid wall insulation can look absolutely awful ! <p> Hi there , it absolutely can . The installer should do a render pull-out test to determine how robust the existing facade is . Given that EWI systems are mechanically fixed with supplementary adhesive , it will allow it to be installed on the substrate , whether it is bricked , painted or rendered . A good system designer is EWI Pro have a look at their website , which should provide more information . But if you need a heads up on good installation companies please also let us know . <p> I really want to get wall insulation but I am worried that if we do it externally it wont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get handed out under government schemes but there is no way external silicone is going to last that long . Are there ways to insulate external walls with solid wall insulation without using silicone anywhere l ? If so then I would get it in my home <p> Hi I live in a 1980s bungalow in mid wales and it has cavity wall insulation ( polystyrene beads ) fitted in a 60mm cavity . There are many cold bridges at each window reveal which causes condensation etc on the wall decoration the property is quite exposed and the walls are regularly battered by wind and rain in the winter , so I was wondering if it would be advantageous to have external insulation fitted which would vastly improve the cold bridging problems , and make the bungalow walls wind and waterproof and it should help the building interior retain more heat than present .

They run on electricity , but are incredibly efficient ( in some cases 300% or more ) , which means that for every one unit of electricity used , they produce 3 units of useful heat . <p> If you compare that to a brand new boiler which is 90% efficient ( 1 unit of gas produces 0.9 units of useful heat ) , you can quickly see why these systems are so popular . In fact , if you do n't  have access to mains gas , heat pumps are definitely the way to go to fulfil- your heating and hot water requirements provided you have a well insulated home , which- is discussed later . <p> Better still , if you decide to install an air source heat pump in your home , you can also benefit from the Renewable Heat Incentive , which pays you for each unit of hot water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cover the cost of installing the heat pump , but it gets paid over 7 years on a quarterly basis , so you will still need to find the money upfront ! <h> How do air source heat pumps work in your house ? <p> The air source heat pump needs to be located outside in the open air , and uses a fan to draw air into it . This air then flows over a heat exchanger , which contains a refrigerant liquid . An evaporator uses the latent heat from the- air- to- heat the- refrigerant liquid sufficiently until it- boils and turns to a gas. - This- gas is then compressed by a compressor , which causes it to- significantly- increase in temperature . An additional- heat exchanger removes the heat from the- refrigerant- ( turning it back to a liquid ) , - which can then be used as useful heat . There are two types of air source heat pump : <h> Air-to-water heat pumps <p> Air to water heat pumps are by far the most popular . These take heat from- air- outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used for space heating or as hot water for washing within the house . <h> Air-to-air heat pumps <p> These remove- latent heat from the air- outside the property which is then simply fed into the home through fans . This type of heat pump can not be used to- produce hot water . <h> Air source heat pumps require electricity to run <p> Since they- include fans and compressors , air- source- heat- pumps require electricity to operate , and bearing in mind the price of electricity is approximately 15p / kWh and gas is just 4p / kWh , on the face of it , you would expect heat pumps to be- far more costly to run than gas boilers . <p> This is not the case though since for every kW of electricity used to run them , they provide approximately 2.5-3.5kW of equivalent- useful energy ( depending on the model and the temperature of the external air ) . This- makes running costs comparable to a traditional gas boiler . <p> The efficiency of air source heat pumps is measured by the Coefficient of Performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced- from each unit of- electricity are consumed to operate the system . For example , if at any moment the heat pump was producing- 3kW of useful heat from each unit of electricity , the CoP would be 3 . <p> The CoP varies throughout the year , with lower figures achieved during the colder months ( meaning they are running less efficiently ) , since there is less ambient heat available to remove from the air . This makes comparing the efficiency of different heat pump systems very difficult , so we use what is known as the- Seasonal Performance Factor to compare like for like performance of models . This is the annualised CoP , taking into account the different performance throughout the year . <h> Air source heat pumps do n't  produce boiling water <p> The air- source- heat- pump- does not produce the sort of hot water temperature you would associate with a gas , LPG or oil-powered boiler . With a boiler , you would expect the hot water to be heated to about 850c , while a heat pump produces water to about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat pump beyond this requires the compressor to work harder , meaning more electricity this in turn reduces its efficiency or coefficient of performance . <p> As a result , - it is very important to minimise heat loss from the property prior to installing a heat pump . This includes insulating the walls , loft and ideally the floor too . This means that even- though the radiators wont get as hot ( using heat pumps ) , the house is still heated effectively and you are not straining the heat pump which is expensive . <p> When installing a heat pump , you may be required to increase the size of some of the radiators in certain rooms too . This is simply because the heat demand will not be met with the existing-sized radiators . If this is the case , you can expect to pay about -200 -300 for each radiator that needs to be replaced ( providing the pipework running to the existing radiator can be reused ) . <h> Air source heat pumps and the Renewable Heat Incentive <p> Heat pumps are part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It means that , if you install a renewable heating technology , you can get paid for each unit of heat- you generate . RHI payment rates depend on lots of things , but you can see detailed information here . <p> Occasionally , but not often , - the RHI payments will be enough to cover- the cost of the initial outlay of the air source heat pump . - Air source heat pumps normally cost between -7,000 -10,000 . In a standard- property you can expect to receive a total of about -2-5,000. - RHI payments are paid quarterly over 7 years , so you will need to stump up the money up front . <h> Things to consider before investing in an air source heat pump <p> Placement of air source heat pump- An air- source- heat- pump requires plenty of space , either to mount on an- external wall or to be placed on the ground . The unit needs- good air flow , and foreign objects such as boxes , containers etc need to be kept well away . <p> Cost of air source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an air source heat pump on top of an existing heating system will prove to be an expensive option ; therefore- we recommend considering this when replacing an old electric or old oil-fuelled system . However an electric heater will convert 1kW of electrical energy to 1kW of heat energy and an air source heat pump will convert 1kW of electrical energy into 3.5kW ( almost 4kW ) of heat energy . <p> Insulation- The air- source- heat- pump emits low temperatures but on a- consistent basis. - To maximise effectiveness , - ensure that your- home is suitably energy efficient by installing wall insulation ( either- cavity- or solid wall ) and- draught proofing . These are low cost measures that will make a big difference to your utility bills , therefore it is worth investing in them prior to replacing your heating system with an air source heat pump . <p> Noise of air source heat pump- An air source heat pump does make some noise when operating , as both a fan and a compressor will be in motion . The noise is approximately 40-60 decibels ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metre away . So please ensure if you invest in an air source heat pump , it is not placed directly outside your bedroom window ! <p> We have- filmed an air source heat pump in motion , ( do n't  say we do n't  treat you ) so you can see- for yourself how they operate . <p> Efficiency of air source heat pumps- Despite air source heat pumps being able to operate at -250C , the efficiency decreases as the outside temperature drops ; therefore if you live in a particularly cold place , you may well need to supplement the heat pump with an additional boiler to get the hot water you require . Try a- CHP boiler- if you can invest additional resources . The problem may be getting the two systems to work successfully in tandem ; therefore a traditional boiler could be your only option . <h> Local authority regulation for air source heat pump installation <p> Generally there are fewer restrictions from local authorities in England and Scotland when looking to- install- an air- source- heat- pump ( noise being- the main- consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installer- before proceeding . In Wales and Northern Ireland , an air source heat pump- installation requires planning permission . <h> Benefits <p> As the heat pump provides the hot water for heating , there are large savings to be made on fuel bills " typically an air source heat pump can deliver up to 3.5kW of useful energy for every 1kW of energy needed to run it . <p> An air source heat pump can still take heat out of the air in temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees . <p> By installing an air source heat pump you can reduce your carbon emissions from your homes heating by 50% . <p> Air source heat pumps are potential income sources , if households qualify for the government Renewable Heat Incentive ( RHI ) scheme . The RHI is payable on an MCS ASHP installation , carried out by an MCS Accredited Installer and the payment is backdated to include any installation installed after 15th July 2009. 184564 @qwx384564 <p> Air source heat pumps can be fairly noisy , approximately 40 65 decibels at a distance of 1m away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our video below for some first hand experience . <p> The equipment needs to sit outside the house , so may not be suitable if there is not sufficient space . <p> Air source heat pumps become less efficient at extracting heat from the air when the external temperature is low , so the amount of usable useful heat they produce is less . <h> Cost <p> An air source heat pump will cost from about -7,000 to install . 184563 @qwx384563 184570 @qwx384570 184567 @qwx384567 184575 @qwx384575 184577 @qwx384577 184572 @qwx384572 <h> 94 comments <p> Hi , I currently have oil central heating but I am interested in installing an . air source heat pump . I have happy with the concept of how they work and their higher levels of efficiency . I guess my concern is the additional cost of changing the radiators to bigger versions so they can still keep our house nice and warm . I understand that since the heat pump produces hot water at a slightly cooler temperature than traditional heating systems you need bigger radiators to ensure rooms still get heated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) do we need increase the radiators ? 150% ? 110% ? Obviously if it is just marginal , I will look to stick with what we have got ! <p> I had an air source heat pump system installed in Oct 2015 in the North of Scotland and Is connected to 11 Dimplex Smart Rads for room heating and also to the DHW . We have been having the problem of when the DHW programme is selected water is still somehow getting to the rads and hence heating the room . I and the installer thought this was possibly to do with the 3 way valve ( ESME valve I think it is called , which operates and blocks off either the water to the room or to the DHW , depending what is programmed . However this was checked over yesterday while I was there and it seems to be working correctly . So the installers seem baffled and are now suggesting that they will run a line from the DHW return to the ASHP unit and put a check valve on it and this should/could solve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100% faith in our installers after a few issues we have had with them since installation , and I would really like a second opinion form another reputable ASHP installer , assuming they would be happy to share their knowledge . We think doing what they propose would not really solve the existing problem , but merely plaster over it . Do you have any thoughts on this and have you had any experience of , or heard of any such problems with other ASHP systems . Maybe I am worrying too much about this and should just let them get on with their fix , but when you have shelled out a lot of money for an heating system I think it is reasonable to ensure it is working absolutely spot on . <p> we bought an Airsource heat pump 2 years ago and would not recommend it if your on gas . Mitsubishi are meant to be the quietest but they still make noise that wakes me up in the night . our electricy bill is massive and it takes agest for the UFH to heat up when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cold kitchen . Stick with gas . maintenance is also expensive . <p> Hi Josie , Normally you would just have a hot water tank in your home which varies in size depending on how much hot water you are going to require ! You can get very small tanks , but if you try to have multiple showers / baths in quick succession , those washing later will have to do so in cold water ! <p> Hi SD , it can you just needs a hot water tank with a dual coil so the tank can receive hot water from two different sources . It is worth mentioning though that if you are looking to take advantage of the renewable heat incentive , if you keep both your boiler and the ASHP , you ASHP usage will be metered , so your payments will be significantly lower ( than if they are deemed i.e. you just have a ASHP as the sole source of heat / hot water ) . <p> Apart from the common heat pumps on the market there is also the thermodynamic air source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air source and a lot less to run and far easier to install , it also produces hot water and is retro fitted to any wet central heating system <p> Can you give me ideal size for a hot water cylinder to work with an air source heat pump . To supply 1 bathroom with a bath and showe and 1 ensuite with a shower for potentially 2 adults and 2 children . <p> can anyone explain this simple question , the Panasonic air source heating system we have had fitted now for the past six months heats enough hot water to fill the bath , yet once the bath is filled the radiators go cold and it takes roughly an hour and a half to get the heat ( very poor heat i must add ) back in to the radiators , are we doing some thing wrong ? ? any help would be appreciated thanks for your time , keith . <p> Whilst I am not familiar with a Panasonic system , Mitsubishi and others will be similar , When you run the bath , and the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to heating the water , and the radiators will not be heated for a while since with many systems both will not run together . What you should be able to do is reduce the time the hot water heating is turned on to say 20 minutes then radiator heating can be set to resume for say 40 minutes , this could be repeated for the next hour . If the property is well insulated for the radiators not to work for a short period should not be noticed . Also you should be able to use the immersion heater to heat the water if needed . It is a characteristic of the Heat Pump system that the radiators do not get very hot , and this is why on installation of a heat pump system some radiators may need to be increased in size . You may need to contact the supplier or manufacturer if the instructions about how to do things are not clear Carey Moore <p> I have a Heatking air source which was made by TEV in yorkshire and it has been crap . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 year warranty ( considering they claim they will last 20 years plus ) is over they do n't  want to know . I feel sorry for my neighbours as it sounds like a freight train towing bean cans ! It is more efficient than an immersion , but then what is n't ! We do n't  have mains gas so had to look for a plan b if this sounds like you get an oil boiler . You will have spare money in the end , almost limitless companies who can fix and maintain it and piping hot water I have forgotten what all of these are like ! We also fitted a biomass as a backup steer just as clear of these ! Difficult to get parts , they still should be serviced regularly and in the last 3 years the pellet price has doubled ! ! My costs are approx. ( using just one source per day ) pellets -10 , immersion heater 6kw total -12 or air source -7.00 obviously when using pellets I also use some electric during the day . <p> gas is far superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be low frequency through the walls . gas any time . plus you are never warm and hot water warm without topping us from immersion <p> We have had a heat pump for over a year now and never have one again . Its noisy , rubbish for radiators and takes so long to heat the UFH compared to the boiler . Not worth the time and effort of installation . A modern gas boiler ( if that 's an option for you ) is head and shoulders the way to go . <p> I believe your comments to be misleading . We are plagued by a neighbours ASHP within a baffle box and with a bare 1m from the fence . Our bedroom and living room windows are within 5m of the ASHP . There is a limit of 37DbAs permitted on this installation but it is usually run at over 40DbAs . As far as can find out NOBODY has mentioned the noise and effect of the compressor : the constant low pulsating hum . ASHP run 24 hours a day . These devices are NOT neighbour friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I question whether they are at all suitable in Scotland in areas where the average temperature is below 7 degrees . I have spoken to many people who have such systems and almost without exception they complain about noise and all bemoan the fact that they are so expensive to run definitely not meeting expectation . Local councils and others appear to be putting their heads in the sand . They do not wish to face reality and noise pollution but are seduced by the idea of being green . Apparently the technology is not as green as we are led to believe as it uses so much electricity . Isnt it time for the real truth of these devices to be published ? <p> Hi Alison , I 'm not in a position to comment on the Db level of the installation in question , but I can with regard energy efficiency . Heat pumps will work at temperatures as low as -15 degrees and their efficiency really does depend on the home they have been installed in . We do sometimes see heat pumps installed in homes that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner a lot more than another form of heating . <p> Homes with ASHPs need to be extremely well insulated , with wall insulation up to at least modern building regulations , as well as excellent loft insulation , windows and draught proofing . Installing an ASHP in an old solid wall property that has not been retrofitted will prove very costly to run , because the pump has to work much harder to get the home up to temperature the running temp of a ASHP is much lower than an average boiler , so the ability of the home to retain heat is critical . <p> My outside unit starts up quietly and runs rather smoothly , but it makes a noticeable , high pitched noise at the end of a cycle which I find unnecessarily loud and disturbing . Is this normal ? I asked the installer who said it was , but he s about as trustworthy as an insurance salesman . Any experience with this ? <p> Hi David , some people do complain of noise with their air source heat pump when they are running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating cycle in colder weather they do need to work harder though so expect slightly more noise . If you have a strange noise at the end of the cycle and you do n't  trust your air source heat pump installer then our advice would be to call the manufacturer of the unit directly and they should be able to advise . <p> Hi Simon , we get a lot of interest for air source heat pumps and once people are used to the technology they tend to be very happy . They are only really going to be viable though where the home is very well insulated . On older cavity wall properties ( where the amount of insulation that can be added is limited by the width of the cavity ) then Air source heat pumps are n't  viable unless the cavity wall insulation is supplemented with internal / external solid wall insulation . Likewise for older solid wall properties as they are , air source heat pumps are n't  suitable , but provided 100mm + of insulation is added to them then suddenly the heat pumps do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at far lower temperatures than traditional boilers , so you really do need to minimise heat loss from the home . <p> I am in the process of gutting s house and am wondering the best heating mechanism . I was keen for a biomass boiler but the digression in the RHI has led me to think an air source heat pump may be the way forward , although I am getting mixed reviews in the comments here . Have you got any advice . The property is 4 bedroom mid terrace . Thanks ! <p> I 've never known such a useless system as this . Still waiting for some heat , perhaps it will materialize by next summer . Trouble is I need it now . The system is indifferent to inputs on the wall mounted thermostat display , and the panel on the boiler is absolutely moronic and has nothing to do with the useless instructions . I WOULD give it to my worst enemy gift wrapped . Absolutely fed-up . Do n't  get one . <p> My dimplex air source heat pump sits directly out side my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not disturb me day or night . It was set on rubber to prevent vibrations being transmitted . It is far quieter than my old Worcester Bosh oil combi boiler ! <p> Hi Somebody mentioned a Perspex lean-to to increase the warm air available and you suggested that the problem then would be the cooling of the air inside this structure but what about if this was a glazed structure with openings designed to allow cold air to sink and be removed and large higher openings for new air to be pulled in ? Even though draughty this would still be significantly warmer with even weak sunshine I know this from my polytunnel which is completely ventilated both ends but very warm even on very cold days . Many thanks <p> Hi James , thanks for the welcome . I will put some realistic information about noise up shortly to hopefully enable people to get a better idea of what to expect . On reading through the above comments I noted that buying the product only , was a challenge . <p> From our point of view the manufactures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not allow us to sell a pump without installation . If we do do we risk losing our certification and authorisation with that manufacturer . <p> So I sympathise with someone who wants to buy it and as above , take it out of the country and install it themselves but the risks are too great for many installers like ourselves . <p> We provide both air and ground source heat pumps to the domestic and commercial market place . We market Daikin , Panasonic and Jaga . These three in our opinion offer good value for money and are very efficient . We offer free advice on cost , noise and ease of installation . If you would like any information please do let me know . <p> Hi Trevor , We get a lot of debate on the noise of the heat pumps , please feel free to add your two pennies worth in the comments section if you feel that would help people make a better informed decision on whether to install an air source heat pump . <p> Would this be a suitable option for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracts a lot of sunshine in the warmer months . It currently has storage heaters as it is not connected to the gas grid and it is not possible to install oil central heating because there is nowhere to house the tank ( the garden is across the road from the house so therefore can not be linked to the house without digging up the road ! ) There is a lot of wall space on the sides of the house where a wall mounted system could go . The property is double glazed and has cavity wall and loft insulation ( not floors though ) . There is a wood burner and a hot water cylinder in the boiler cupboard . I was wondering as a rough idea what sort of insulation cost we would be looking at as there is no current central heating . The property has 4 large bedrooms , 2 kitchens , 2 sitting rooms etc. so is large . If this is not suitable are there any other options other than storage heaters and woodburner as it is an expensive system in the cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump last summer . I am actually really happy with it however people need to be aware that the coefficient of performance varies massively throughout the year . During the summer months the coefficient of performance is really high but during the winter it can drop to just one or 1.2 . When the manufacturer installed it for us they made no mention of this . Having said that we have underfloor heating and we are very very happy with it . <p> I live in a semi basement flat some of it under ground built 1880 , solid wall construction . some rooms have been tanked and thermolight blocks used . Due to very high cealings ( 3.2m ) I intend to DPM all floors , insulate 120mm kingspan and a underfllor heating system laid in a screed to give a good thermal mass , timer battons and wooden floor , tiles . Ceilings will have lots of insulation mixture of rockwool/kingspan and walls will be clad in 25mm kingspan , battend and infilled with rockwool and clad in plaster board/insulation ( celutex ) type ) As this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is the best heating source fore the underfloor heating , i currently have a gas boiler so have mains gas . i also intend to install a pv and thermal for hot water in the future if and when i can afford it ? <p> Hi Dominic , you may go for the air source but to be honest if you have a gas boiler in place that has some life left in it , you may as well stick with . Especially if it is a condensing boiler unit , then it will be quite efficient to operate . Also the price of gas is generally 3 times less than the price of electricity . <p> Hi there , were air source and ground source heat pump installers . Clients that we 've installed heat pumps for are all very satisfied as a heat pump is very easy to maintain and they have already seen savings on their bills . Ground source is a bit more tricky but still a great system , but it does depend on where you are . <p> Hi James , I could n't find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously going to better than here in the UK ! With any heat pump there is always going to be a significant seasonal variation so in the winter the Coefficient of performance ( CoP ) will be far lower compared to the summer ( the CoP is the efficiency at any one moment ) . As mentioned though , your SPF is going to be higher since you average temperature in the winter is 12 degrees and here it is about 4-5 degrees ! <p> Hi Steve , no this wo n't help because the air in the enclosure will keep getting colder and colder ! The key is that there is an air flow so the colder air can be replaced by warmer air as the heat pump functions . <p> I have an air source heat pump that was installed by a non-MCS installer . However I have just found out that the Government is giving a generous subsidy towards the cost recovery should I have the whole system commissioned ? Had the air source heat pump put on end of 2012 it is one of the Vaillant models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioned if you can Matthew although it may not be possible depending on the unit installed . I would speak to an MCS installer about this they normally charge about -500 to carry out this service , but because of the RHI payments it is definitely worth doing ! <p> Hi Lance the EcoDan heat pumps are probably the most recognised brand now they had a huge stand at EcoBuild again this year I know that is not really a measure of how big a company is , but it impressed us ! ! <p> If Worcester bosch are considered the best gas boiler manufacturer , what would the equivalent be in terms of air source heat pumps ? I have heard that Mitsubishi do one called the Ecodan but not sure about other brands ! Cheers lance <p> We have installed an air source heat pump on the roof of our fairly large 4 bed house . It heats the hot water and provides heating via underfloor pipes . The house is very well insulated and so far it is very warm . My question relates to how best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it run all the time day and night for maximum efficiency . It runs based just on the outside air temperature . There is no internal thermostat . I am no expert but can not help thinking this is not best for us : ( i ) we also have photo electric panels and use the electricity generated directly , only selling the surplus to the grid , therefore it appears highly inefficient to me to run the heat pump at night when we are not generating our own electricity , ( ii ) as it is always cooler at night the heat pump probably works more as it works off external temperature , but this is when it is at its least efficient ( iii ) we would prefer it to be cooler at night for sleeping . the house retains the heat very well and frankly it is too warm at night ( iv ) also while the noise is minimal , i would prefer to be without it at night . <p> Despite the advice of the installer , should i be considering instead to run it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lower termperature during the night ? He says this would be less efficient and bad for the heat pump . <p> Hello . I am told that ASHPs are n't  noisy but mine certainly seems to be . There are enclosures that cut the noise down . I made my own but they can be bought . In the winter I found that the pump runs almost continuously . These things really are n't  suitable for quiet country locations . <p> the church near us has one and has spoilt our peace and quite we can feel the fan cutting in the air at 3am and also feel the vibrations from under the bed health and safety officers have been good and are recommending to the church that they move it . <p> My partner and I looking to move back to our Hampshire cottage having lived in France for 15years . We have been away for a long time so do n't  know about the current regimes and schemes that are running to help fund home improvements . In France we were able to get a grant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard about the RHI and this helps for air source heat pumps , so do you know whether the rates are the same as they were when it first came out ? <p> Juliet , thanks for your note . The RHI rates are currently as they were when the policy launched in April , however they are under constant quarterly revisions by DECC . The next one is now and the following one at some point in Jan 2015 . <p> We had 12kw air source heat pump fitted this summer . The figures so far suggest that it will save us money over the oil fired system that we had previously and the RHI will almost cover the cost of the installation . The noise of the ASHP is much worse than I was led to believe though . I would have looked into a ground source system more closely if I 'd known how noisy this system was going to be . <p> Hi Gerald , thanks for your comments , so we tried doing a few videos to show people how loud heat pumps are ( you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key is positioning them correctly putting them just beneath the bedroom for example is not ideal , but good point people do need to be aware that air source heat pumps do make a bit of noise . <p> Hello James . It is very quiet where I live and perhaps my heat pump is louder than most . I 've built an enclosure for it ( with louvres to allow air movement ) and it is quieter now but still louder than the 54 db that the manufacturer claims . Does the RHI payment match inflation the way that the FIT for solar panels does ? <p> I am looking to purchase a heat pump . but , I want to install it myself . I see you say that you install them , can you tell me where you buy them ? I can locate places to get them but they wo n't sell it to me because they want to install it . As I live in France and am restoring an old house I am quite capable of doing it myself . all the other work has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to connect it all up . Any help on this matter would make me very happy chappie . <p> We have just bought a 1960s ground floor apartment in Eastbourne East Sussex it has old style storage radiators and the hot water is provided with an immersion heater would this system be appropriate and what would it cost please ? We will also be refurbishing as it was previously rented . Look forward to a cheaper system ? ? Thank you for your attention to this matter , Douglas Laurie <p> Douglas , Thanks for your comment . Heat pumps are certainly more efficient and you could be looking at savings of a few hundred pounds a year . Unfortunately the costs of switching are quite high you do n't  have a wet central heating system so you would need to install this as well as the heat pump . The cost is likely to be pushing -10,000 . <p> In your situation I would recommend looking at infrared heating , as well as the modern quantum storage heaters which are more efficient than your old storage heaters but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinks , the RHI makes air source heat pumps and the even more expensive ground source heat pumps well worth installing , especially if you live off grid . I would most certainly recommend installing one of these new heating systems if you can afford the upfront cost . They are actually far more reliable than traditional boiler systems . A really nice helpful concise article . Thanks for sharing <p> How much more is an air source heat pump today than a biomass boiler ? I live in a rural part of Enfield and not unusual for this part of London suburbs that is not on the gas network , but having been running an oil boiler I would like to move to a more sustainable technology . <p> I just made a comment on your forum about the Green Deal but I was particularly interested in the air source heat pumps due to the renewable heat incentive . Do you think if we went independent that the subsidies paid would increase ? Mr Salmond has promised us a lot , it in him that we trust . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about going yes . <p> Hi Grant , we do n't  comment on politics on this website we have a strong non-partisan editorial . However what I would say is that if there are changes to geographical borders then we will probably have a significant impact to the energy policy across the UK . Remember if you are going down the air source heat pump route the best thing you could do is to insulate the roof and the walls as the heating system will operate at a much lower temperature . A well insulated house will make the heating source worth , and this goes beyond the subsidy . It has to be about keeping your bills down whilst being comfortable in the coldest of winter days . <p> Just had the first company round to quote for the Ground Source heat pump , he recommended Vailliant which I have had a quick look on the internet about and they seem to get good feedback . It will require two boreholes 120m deep , but they think they could get these drilled by the end of September if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful we are back here in the UK now so may give GreenAge a call to discuss if that is okay . I think we have space for the GSHP since we have a large back garden and I think you can can drill the holes vertically . The question now is simply whether the Government payments will cover the install cost over the lifespan of it being paid ! ! <p> I am wondering whether to go air source or ground source heat pump , I know there are big price differences but I have heard the government subsidy pretty much covers install cost , I am more interested in the advantages of one of the other . Any help would be hugely appreciated ! <p> Hi Beatrix , Government subsidies and the initial install cost aside comes down to the performance of the ASHP and GSHP . In the winter , when heat demand is highest an air source heat pump is tring to pull heat from colder air , so the compressor in the unit has to work harder to drive the temperature of the water up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , they are running more inefficiently . <p> Conversely with a ground source heat pump , the temperature under the ground is fairly consistent all year around this means that the temperature of the fluid returning to the ground source heat pump unit will be relatively even all year round so the heat pump will never have to work harder at different times of the year , hence a higher seasonal performance factor ( and a more even coefficient of performance ) . <p> If you have the money and space , the ground source in our opinion are better , purely because of the efficiency in the winter when your demand for hot water is at its highest . <p> I had a Mitsubishi Ecodan installed in our new build home end of 2013 . I have had a Green Deal Assessment as your site suggests so that is all fine , but then I queried the installers for the coefficient of performance . They stated that it is always 2.5 for RHI purposes . Is this correct ? As this is slightly different to what you suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed bungalow in the countryside . The property currently has a condensing oil boiler but we are thinking of installing a heat pump . The property is of 1950s construction , has timber frame walls and our loft insulation has recently been topped up by ECO . Do you know how much roughly we would be able to gain from the Renewable Heat Incentive ? Thank you <p> Hi Gareth , The RHI payment will be considerable , because it is a reasonably large property and the wall will not be particularly well insulated . Unfortunately the bad news is that a 50s timber frame property is not going to be sufficiently well insulated to be able to effectively run a heat pump . You will have to install expensive wall insulation to make the property suitable . <p> You might be better off considering a biomass boiler , since you live in the country . Insulation is less of a problem with biomass and the RHI is very generous . <p> How big are the actual air source heat pump units ? I know it will depend slightly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need to know whether it is feasible to squeeze one under a window in the garden . The house has 3 bedrooms and 7 radiators in total , and it is mid terrace ( if that provides a view on how big the heat pump needs to be ! ) <p> Hi Maggie , if you see James Adams answer below , hopefully that will give you a little bit of context . Also feel free to look at the video in the article to give you a real life view . You do n't  have to squeeze the pump in , it can be installed further away from the property as long as it complies with the relevant regulation . If you would like , send us an email to mailbox and we can email you some additional real life photographs . Hope that is helpful . <p> Hi maggie , I installed a Mitsubushi Ecodan ( 8.5kW ) for my house and it is about 1m high by 1m wide . It works incredibly well . I would really strongly recommend them . Informative post though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hi James When you say " you " installed a Mitsubishi , Ecodan do you mean YOU installed it or a company did it for you ? As I have been trying to buy one to install myself , but No one seems to want to sell me one , unless they install it , As I live in France this would be difficult , but am willing to come to UK just to get it , which would be a 3 day round trip by car/van I am not interested whether the guarantee is valid or not I just want to buy one . Any comments greatly appreciated . <p> Had an installer quote -25K for an -8k pump and swapping out of downstairs radiators . He also said the SPF for this make and model is 4.5 . It is for a Daikin pump . I have seen you give people here free advice , could you let me know if this is reasonable ? Alsk I do n't  think the installer is Green Deal approved , can I still get a grant as he suggested after it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message . -25K does seem a bit high , but it is difficult for us to comment without seeing yur property . Our recommendation is to always get 3 quotes or more for the work , that way you can be sure you are getting a good deal . <p> You can still get the RHI with a non-green deal company as long as the installer is MCS accredited make sure you check this with them , it is really important and ensures their work is to a good standard . <p> Interesting technology I live in a council house which has had the walls and lofts insulated . The boiler is quite old and I worry about gas safety . Do you think councils will be installing these as part of a government subsidy ? <p> Hi Bernice , I do n't  at the moment to be honest , simply because the initial install costs are far higher than a new energy efficient boiler . That being said , if you do have the money lying around they are definitely worth doing since they are efficient and you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment for getting these installed . Over the 7 years that the the RHI is paid , it should cover the majority of the the install cost . <p> In france , we have been bought up to use electricity because of all our nuclear power , we do n't  use gas in the same way to heat homes . These heat pumps are therefore perfect , I have an air to water source heat pump and it provides hot water &amp; heating for the house ( we do sometimes supplement with a wood burner ) . I can not recommend them strongly enough useful article too ! 
@@36748780 @5748780/ <h> Radiators " your one stop guide ! <h> October 22 , 2013 <p> We get tons of questions from our customers regarding radiators : when to change them , when to flush them , how to bleed them and so forth " so here we have produced a one stop guide to radiators and all the important things you need to know . <h> Bleeding your radiators <h> What is it and why do you need to do it ? <p> Bleeding is where you vent trapped air from the radiator , which can build up over time and prevent your radiators from working correctly . Small amounts of air enter the central heating system every time fresh mains water flows through the boiler/heating system . This air collects at the top of the radiators , preventing the top part of the radiator filling with warm water and therefore reducing its heating capability . <p> It is important to bleed your radiators on a regular basis , since releasing this trapped air can dramatically improve the efficiency of your central heating . It is a simple job that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however if you have any problems or you are unsure how to proceed , it is worth getting a plumber to do this for you . <h> How do you know if your radiator needs bleeding ? <p> The best way to check is to turn your heating on and wait for the radiators to warm up . If there are any cool spots , especially near the top of the radiator , you may need to bleed it . If the radiator does n't warm up at all , then potentially it is completely full of air and so this will need to be released before it can be used to heat rooms . <h> How do I bleed my radiator ? <p> Firstly ensure your heating is off " you do n't want to burn yourself with hot water ! <p> You will then need a radiator bleeding key , or a flat headed screwdriver for more modern systems . At the top of the radiator at one end you will find a valve where you can put the key or screwdriver . Make sure you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn the valve anti-clockwise . You should start to hear gas escaping with a hissing sound . Eventually the gas will all be gone and liquid will start to escape . You then need to close the valve as quickly as possible to stop too much water escaping and making a mess . <p> The last step after bleeding all your radiators with cold spots is to check the pressure of the system . If you have bled a lot of gas , the pressure in the system may be low and in this instance you will need to top it up using the filling loop ' , which is a little lever on your boiler . <p> The final check is to turn your heating back on and just confirm that the cold spots have disappeared . <h> Flushing radiators <p> Flushing your radiators is a job carried out by professionals and involves completely cleaning them out and gets rid of any sludge that has built up over the years . It is definitely worth doing and you may find the improved warmth of your rooms means you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a relatively more tricky procedure , and must be done by an expert . Typically this will cost a few hundred pounds . You should be aware that some older radiators could show up a leak and youd- a new radiator , but flushing really is worthwhile as your heating system should be a lot more efficient as a result . <p> It is also a good time to get a cleaning system like magnaclean ( a magnetic filter ) , which helps to keep the radiators crud free in future , although this will usually be done when installing a new boiler anyway . <h> Old vs. new radiators <p> We often get asked when a customer is considering a new boiler " should we also change our radiators ? There are several things to consider with this and it is not a straightforward yes or no answer , but some key things you should remember are : <p> After flushing your old radiators when installing the new system , there is a small chance you will get leaks , so you should be aware that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If your old radiators are quite small , they will need to be hotter to heat the room to your preferred temperature , which means the boiler is working harder . Larger radiators are more efficient as they can run at a lower temperature and still heat the room sufficiently . <p> Some older radiators may not be able to handle the output from your new boiler , especially if you are getting a combi or a larger boiler than you had previously . Your installer should be able to help you with this . <p> New radiators are often not included in any quote you get , so be aware that you are going to be paying more if you go for new ones ! <h> How much do new radiators cost ? <p> Typically a new radiator will cost less than -100 ( this will depend on the size ) and you will have to pay for the installation as well . But remember , it is important to get the right size for the room " do n't just assume that the radiators you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> What type of radiators should I install ? <p> Firstly you need to decide which type of radiator you are going for . <p> The single and double panel radiators ( which can be seen below ) are the older style " and nowadays if you go into a DIY store you are not going to be able to buy this type of radiator . <p> It may well be worth replacing this type of radiator instead of going through the costly process of flushing it out and if you do decide to do this , you will probably get away with using a smaller convector radiator because the through out more heat . <p> There are three main types of convector radiator ( which you can see below ) : <p> Single Panel Convector radiators <p> Double Panel Convertor radiators <p> Double Panel Double Convector radiators <p> The panel refers to the long metal tanks that run parallel to the wall " it is these that fill with the hot water from your central heating systems and emit heat around the room . The longer the panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger radiators will emit more heat , but also remember that a double panel radiator will emit more heat than a single panel radiator of the same length . <p> The convector fins ( the zig-zagging metal strips ) are welded to the panels and these are used to increase the surface area of the radiator so it emits more heat in a room . As mentioned previously , if you are replacing an older radiator without the convector fins , it is possible to install a much smaller convector radiator that will produce the same amount of heat . <p> The final thing to consider when buying a new radiator is the style at the top . Round top radiators allow you to see the convector fins , while compact radiators have a grill across the top of the panels that obscures the view of the convector panels . The performance of the two types of panel is pretty much identical , so this comes down to the finish you prefer ! <p> Before you guy out and buy the radiator , you need to calculate the heating requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size . <h> Sizing your radiator <p> The heat requirement of individual rooms is absolutely key to choosing the correct size radiator . For example , If you have a huge room with lots of external solid brick wall ( notoriously bad at retaining heat ) and you have a small single panel convector radiator fitted , it is likely the room is going to still be very cold , so you are going to need to supplement the heat . <p> There are software tools available that let you work out the exact heat demand of the room in question . These take into account the wall type , insulation present , the floor type , size of the room , amount of external wall and the intended use for the room . <p> Once you have your heat demand " typically several kilowatts or more you can then use an equation like the one below to determine the length of the radiator required ( this is based on a 50cm high radiator : <p> Length = Heat Demand ( Watts ) / ( X*62 ) <p> Where X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no convector , 0.13 for single panel convector , 0.19 for double panel convector and 0.24 for double panel double convectors ) . <p> This equates to a difference of around 50% between the single convectors and double convectors , so it really does make a big difference . <p> With modern boilers , it is always best to design for a slightly larger radiator than you think is necessary " apart from the initial extra cost , there are not really any additional costs further along the line , since you can use thermostatic radiator valves to control the temperature of the individual radiator . <h> Where should my radiators go ? <p> The British standard is to place radiators on external walls under windows where possible . The external wall is easier to mount and these are usually the coldest areas of the room , so it will help to offset that and create a more evenly warmed room . On the downside , curtains above the window may shield the radiator , and heat will be lost through the exterior walls and windows . Installing a radiator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Radflek can really help reduce this heat loss . You might also wish to install a radiator fan to ensure the hot air gets evenly dispersed through the room ( meaning the heat is felt more effectively so you can turn down the heating ) . <h> Radiator cabinets and furniture <p> Although they may hide the radiator from view , radiator cabinets can seriously reduce the heat output of the radiator . If you are planning to hide the radiator away like this , you will have to get bigger radiators . Likewise , if you have furniture directly in front of your radiators , it will absorb the heat produced , therefore installing a radiator fan will help redirect the heat around the room helping it to warm up quicker . <h> Which radiators are most efficient and are radiator boosters worth it ? <p> All radiators effectively have the same efficiency " they give off the heat depending on how hot the water is being pumped into them . As we have mentioned however , the more panels and convector fins the radiator has , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that you can get away with a smaller radiator for the room than you would have with a single radiator however " they are all equally efficient ( i.e. same cost per unit of heat ) . <p> The type of metal the radiator is made out of will determine how quickly it heats up " so an aluminium radiator will heat up a lot quicker than steel . This should not be an issue if you have a thermostat , as it will keep the room at a constant temperature . <h> 17 comments <p> Hi , my son has a convector radiator in his bedroom which desperately needs bleeding , however the inner part where you enter the key has broken off so i 'm unable to turn to let out air . Does anyone please advise whether its still possible or whether the radiator would need new part ? <p> Hi Nicci , you are really going to struggle here if you cant use a radiator key to be honest if you can still remove the Radiator Bleed Valve ( using pliers or something ) it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not sure if you get a yearly check on your boiler ( which we recommend ) but if so , ask the plumber to bring a selection of radiator bleed valves with them so hopefully they can make the swap and have a ready replacement ! <p> I want to replace an old double Panal radiator but it is the old imperial size 45 ? X 22 ? . The piping comes through the floorboards and I do not want to change it.Can you still get the same size radiator anywhere .. Suggestions would be welcome.Thanks <p> Common misconception in this article it is not air that you are bleeding from the radiators , it is hydrogen a by product of the constant erosion taking place in the radiator . The reason people think its air is because corrosion occurs more quickly in open-vented ( i.e. exposed to the air ) systems . <p> I just bought a Pontiac Vibe 2005 which was assembled in Fremont , CA , USA to Nigeria . Its has a single panel radiator and some people are asking me to change it to double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's ur professional advise ? <p> It depends ! Radiators get warm because they fill with hot water . If you have more than one radiator , and you want them all on ( i.e. hot ) they need to have hot water flowing through them . The more hot water you need to create via your boiler , the more gas you will use and therefore the more you will pay on your gas bill . The reason it depends is that one radiator running at 100% would require the same amount of hot water as two radiators running at 50% ( if they were the same size ) . Normally though , the more radiators you have , the more hot water you are going to require . <p> There is no gas in the radiators just water , however from time to time , air bubbles do form which is why you bleed the radiators to hear a regular hissing does sound a bit strange . Might be worth calling a gas safe plumber around to investigate ! <p> What about the new antique looking radiators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newer radaiators in my opinion but I want to make sure they have equal efficiency .

Situated on the North East coast of England , the- ConocoPhillips Refinery- is one of the largest CHP plants in Europe and together with the refineries that underpin it , employs a large number of people in Grimsby , Hull and Lincoln . <p> The ideas and blueprint for the project began in 1998 as ConocoPhilips sought to upgrade the energy supply for its Humber refinery , which essentially needed more steam for its refinery business . In addition , the existing- boiler providing the steam was- deemed to be out of date and inefficient , increasing the urgency of this- project . The ideal solution was- to upgrade the existing technology so that both efficiency was increased , as well as reducing the impact on the local environment . Electricity generating capacity was also added , allowing- the power plant to be connected to the grid so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , the company was relying on the grid to supply electricity as well as- processes that failed to provide the quantity of- steam required . With uncertainty about gas prices and the capital investment required to undertake a project of this size , Conoco Philips qualified for investment defined under the- UK CHP programme- and under the- EU Cogen Directive , - the project got- the green light . <p> Moreover , the UK Government at the time introduced- Enhanced Capital Allowances- ( ECA 's ) and the- Climate Change Levy , with Immingham CHP being included in these schemes . These measures related to capital investments and designed to encourage quality CHP . In summary they allow for accelerated depreciation for tax purposes , which means those undertaking the investment like Conoco Phillips benefit from a lower tax bill and keep hold of more cash . <h> Key Operational Facts Immingham CHP Power Plant <p> ConocoPhilips ICHP is one of the largest industrial scale CHP plants in Europe . As part of phase 2 , the power station now produces 1200MWs of electrical power and has significantly increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations in November 2004 and peak output is approximately 735 MW . The Phase 2 Extension is proposed to provide an additional 470 MW , bringing the total to a nominal 1210 MW . Phase 1 ICHP Plant produces electricity for the Humber Refinery and supply to the national grid . The additional capacity was expected to be provided to the national grid and to existing and new third party customers . The proposed fuels used on site were natural gas , distillate fuel oil and refinery off-gas . <h> Immingham Power Plant- Business Partners <p> There are two sites , one that holds the refinery and the other that has the Immingham Combined Heat and Power ( ICHP ) plant . Crucially , one of the main outputs is steam , which also serves Total 's neighbouring Lindsay Refinery .

Another key- benefit- arising- from the Immingham CHP is that it contributes- to the energy infrastructure on the South Humber Bank which will almost certainly be required- for future - industrial development in the area . 
@@36748783 @5748783/ <h> Convection vs Radiant Heating <h> January 28 , 2015 <p> You may have heard about terms such as convection or radiant heating , but have always been confused about the fundamental differences . In this blog we will explain how both heating methods work and demonstrate with examples which tools perform this job . <h> What is convection heating ? <p> Convection heaters heat the air and then transfer the heat throughout that space to warm up people and physical objects . For example , your gas boiler central heating system is a perfect example of a predominantly convection based system . When you turn on your heating , the radiators warm up as the water that circulates in the system gets hotter . After 15-20mins or so you can feel the room getting warmer as that heat is distributed from the surface area of the radiators into the room . <h> FROM -16.99 <p> Warm air rises and gets moved into cold spaces such as the middle of the room , where it cools , sinks and circulates back up again as it is warmed up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives you the warmth that you feel . <h> Other examples of convection heating <p> Storage heaters " like your wet central heating system , the storage heaters will warm a room by released warm air , which may also get pushed with higher velocity using assisted fans . <p> Electric Panel heaters " like storage heaters , these heaters will push out warm air into a physical space warming it up . <p> Underfloor heating " most common solutions are wet systems powered either by boilers or heat pumps and like the radiator concept above the heating is distributed the same way " warm air rises and cools until it heats the physical space warming everything around it . <p> Fire places " burning a fuel such as coal , gas or wood creates heat . The fuel requires moving air to ignite , so sucks up the cold air and released warm air as a by-product . <h> Limitations of convection heating <p> There are a couple of downsides- to- convection heating . Firstly , it relies on the movement of air and although the method of heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult . So you- tend not to see even temperatures throughout the room with convection heaters . Secondly , holding the heat in the air is n't particularly stable . Imagine spending half an hour heating the temperature in the air up to 21oC only for someone to briefly open the door . Lots of that heat will escape , which- your convection heater will have to replace . <h> What is radiant heating ? <p> Radiant heating simply uses radiation to heat surfaces of objects . Unlike convection heating that heats the air , radiant heating emits infrared radiation , which travels unimpeded until it hits a solid object , which absorbs the radiation and warms up . A good everyday example of this in practice is the sun " this is why when it is particularly chilly , you can still feel the warmth as the sun shines on your face . <p> Radiant heating is more direct that convection heating , so people and objects in theory should feel the warmth a lot quicker , despite the air around being at a lower temperature . Once the objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should at this point gently give off heat to the surrounding air . Although radiant heating has been around for a long time as a concept , it is only now beginning to gain some momentum in the UK . <p> Radiant heating in the form of Infrared Heating Panels is on the rise in the UK . The basic idea is that instead of holding the heat in the air , like convection , it holds the heat in the thermal mass of the room . So if a door opens , replenishing the lost heat becomes a lot easier as the infrared panels turn the room into a 360o radiator . <h> Examples of radiant heating <p> Infrared heating panels " ( far infrared ) in the residential and commercial space , these far infrared heaters can be installed in the walls or the ceilings and emit invisible infrared heat to the targeted areas . <p> Halogen heaters " ( near infrared ) you would have seen these in pubs and railway stations " essentially they glow a bright orange and emit heat as they get hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is understandable the public is a little more sceptical to this form of heating since convection is a more common way of heating in the UK . Also people are worried as soon as they hear the word radiation ' as they automatically think it is a bad thing . Taking those two points separately below : <p> With the infrared heating panels ( a common radiant heating source ) they are actually becoming a lot more widely accepted , since they have had a long track record in Germany , Austria and Scandinavian countries , which have used the technology for a number of years . <p> Infrared radiation is completely safe and should not be confused with UV light , which is harmful and folks should stay away from . Lots of things emit infrared " the warmth of the sun , and the warm feeling you get in front of a fire . 
@@36748784 @5748784/ <h> Biomass boilers vs conventional gas boilers <h> Heating <h> Comparing the cost of biomass boilers with- conventional boilers <p> Biomass boilers start at about -7,000 for a 12kW domestic version , which is sufficient to provide heat and hot water for a 4-bed house . A comparably sized gas boiler will only cost around -2500 to install . A bigger biomass boiler with an auto-feed hopper may cost closer to -12,000 . <p> However , biomass boilers burn biomass fuel , which is considered renewable . Therefore , provided that the boiler is MCS-accredited , you will be eligible for the Renewable Heat Incentive that will pay you- for every kilowatt-hour of heat produced . <p> In terms of the cost of fuel , the average price of wood pellets are around 4.2p/kWh which is very much in line with mains gas , while oil costs a little more at 6p/kWh . However , the price of wood pellets is likely to become more attractive going forward since gas prices have continued to rise in recent years , and this trend looks to continue . Biomass boilers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as gas and oil . <p> Also , if you are lucky enough to have a free supply of wood , then you can heat your home at zero cost . <h> Comparing biomass boiler maintenance with- conventional boilers <p> If you decide to opt for a biomass boiler , you will have to feed it fuel from time to time . For example the Baxi Bioflo will need to be refuelled every 3 -4 days . Bigger biomass boilers with auto-feed hoppers will only need to be refuelled every couple of weeks . In addition , ash builds up as part of the combustion process ( wood combustion produces about 0.5% 1.5% by weight of ash ) which will need to be emptied too . <p> A gas boiler is very much an install and forget technology , so it is the clear winner here . <h> Comparing the size of- biomass with- conventional boilers <p> Biomass boilers are much bigger than conventional boilers , since they will have to have some element of an auto-feed option . In the case of the Baxi Bioflo , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size . <p> The other thing is that gas tends to come from the mains gas supply via a gas pipe . A biomass boiler will need to be situated relatively close to a fuel supply , which obviously means you are going to need a decent-sized storage facility that can be kept dry and contained so there is no fire risk . <h> Comparing the environmental credentials of biomass boilers and conventional boilers <p> Biomass boilers run on biomass fuel . Biomass fuel tends to be derived from quick-growing trees and fuel grasses . Trees absorb carbon dioxide as part of photosynthesis , which is the process that allows them to produce sugars required for growth . When the trees are felled and then burnt , they release the same level of carbon dioxide that they took in , meaning that biomass is arguably a carbon-neutral fuel . <p> It can be argued that gas is also derived from the breakdown of vegetation , but this process takes millions of years , and we are currently using the gas at such a rate that we are getting through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is therefore not sustainable . As a result gas and other fossil fuels are not considered to be renewable , since the time scale for the process to occur is simply too long . <p> As a result , burning biomass is not considered particularly harmful to the environment , whereas burning gas is considered to have negative consequences . <p> The other thing to bear in mind is that growing crops for fuel is only okay if the land that the crops are being grown on has not historically been used to grow food . Growing fuel crops at the expense of food crops is obviously an unsustainable practise . <h> The final verdict " biomass versus conventional boilers <p> MCS-approved pellet fired or gasification biomass boilers are comparable with the most- efficient conventional gas boilers and , through the Renewable Heat Incentive , they actually produce a very healthy return ( provided the heat demand on your EPC is sufficient ) .

I installed a system a year ago at a cost of over -100k . It has underperformed from an efficiency and RHI return point of view .

We had one installed 2 years ago for our 4 bed house , taking advantage of the grants then available . We beleived that with the lower cost of fuel we would recoup the additional cost within 5-7 years . That was before we got our first annual service bill . At nearly -400 this almost eliminates the difference in fuel costs .

@@36748786 @5748786/ <h> Should I replace my conventional boiler with a combi ? <h> October 15 , 2014 <p> If you have just bought a new home , your existing boiler has broken down or the boiler that you have is over 12 years old then you may well be considering a replacement . Combi boilers are fantastic , as they provide space heating as well as water on demand " you can do away with the hot water tank . <p> If you have a regular heat only boiler is it worth making the change ? <h> Your existing heating system <p> First of all it is important to establish the existing heating system you have and the type of arrangement you are looking for , which will then impact whether a combi boiler is appropriate to install in your home . <p> When talking about conventional systems ' we are normally referring to a heat-only boiler , which has two cold-water tanks in the loft space and a hot water tank , normally found in the airing cupboard . <p> A system boiler is very much like a heat-only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion cold-water tanks in the loft . <p> A combi boiler , as discussed previously , works by providing hot water without the need for a hot or cold water tank . Basically , if you turn the hot water taps on , the boiler will fire up and heat the water coming out of the pipes . Since you do n't need to store the hot water before you use it ( i.e. there is no hot water tank ) , these tend to be considered more efficient . <h> What are the reasons for installing a combi boiler ? <p> One of the main reasons for installing a combi boiler is the fact you can do away with the water tanks and this obviously frees up a lot of space . This is particularly important in flats and small houses where space is at a premium . Imagine suddenly being able to use your existing airing cupboard for additional storage space . You still need a space for the boiler of course , but it is typically similar in size to a standard heat-only boiler and could go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point is the fact that the combi boiler does n't produce and store hot water . With a regular boiler , hot water tends to be produced twice a day regardless of if it gets used or not " in the morning and in the evening . Now obviously this requires the boiler to fire up to produce the hot water , and if for whatever reason it does n't get used the water simply cools down , which is a waste of energy . Combi boilers only produce the hot water when you need it ( i.e. you turn a tap or the shower on ) , so obviously for many people this produces substantial energy savings . <p> Combi boilers are great when you have relatively small hot water demand at any one time . If you require hot water feeds in multiple outlets at the same time " say that you want to run 2 showers at the same time in the morning , then a combi boiler wo n't be suitable . In this case a regular or system boiler might be more suitable . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system boiler once you have used all the hot water , that is it ; you 'll need to wait until the boiler fires up and produces new hot water as per your programmer settings . With a combi boiler you could in theory produce limitless hot water although the mains water pressure defines the output . <p> Obviously it is worth mentioning efficiency " a new combi boiler should be 90% efficient ( as would a new system or regular boiler ) , so if your boiler is particularly old you might want to install a new boiler at this point. - You can run some calculations to see if this might be relevant for you " you can learn more about this by clicking here . <h> When should I install a combi boiler ? <p> You can in theory change your heating system any time , but the best time to do this is probably during a general refurbishment ( provided the boiler is working okay ! ) . - Carrying out this work when you refurbish will help minimise upheaval since things like running new pipes under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ! Adding any new radiators to the system will obviously make this a bigger job , as will a system conversion when you move from a system or heat-only boiler ( with tanks ) to a combi . <p> If you are carrying out refurbishment work , you should also try and install as much insulation as you can at the same time as installing a new heating system " this will lower your gas demand since heat will leave the home more slowly and therefore you should see even bigger energy savings . <p> We also recommend looking to install a boiler before- the winter , since at this time there tends to be a big rush on plumbers , which pushes the price up a little changing the boiler during the summer months should therefore be a little cheaper . <p> The final point is related to positioning the new boiler " with regards to where the existing boiler and flue currently sit . If the boiler is being replaced then the flue will have to sit on an outside facing wall , which may require physically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A plume diverter may also need to be installed depending how close the current flue is in proximity to your local neighbours . <h> Condensing combi boilers <p> Condensing boilers are pretty much standard these days for all domestic applications " any boiler you install now , be it combi , heat only or system will be condensing . <p> Condensing boilers are highly efficient and most are now manufactured with an efficiency rating of 90% or better . They use heat in the waste flue gas to pre-heat the cold water going into the boiler , hence this high level of efficiency . <p> A condensing combi boiler ( like all condensing boilers ) will have an additional condensing pipe that allows the condensed vapours to be drained away as the boiler is working . This should n't be a problem as long as the installer can attach the pipe outlet to a drain , either internal or external . If this is n't possible then the boiler may have to be relocated , which will add to the overall installation cost . <h> Combi boilers and flue gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( FGHRS ) works by using a further heat-exchanging unit to take advantage of the heat within the waste flue gasses , which any boiler will produce . This recovered heat is used to preheat the cold water entering the boiler , thereby lowering the amount of energy needed to warm the water up to the required level . <p> Even the most efficient boilers available on the market today are only 90% efficient , as a result of heat lost in the waste flue gas , however the installation of a FGHRS on even a brand new boiler can help further drive up energy efficiency , helping you save money on your bills . <p> However , depending on the installation a separate FGHRS will add to the overall installation cost , and with the GDHIF being scrapped in 2014 , there are few incentives to draw on to ensure the installation process is cost effective . <h> Is it worth swapping to a combi boiler ? <p> If you have a small house and you are already tight for space , then combi boilers are a fantastic solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will be carrying out extensive refurbishment , then having a new heating system installed at this time is ideal . <p> On the other hand , if you have a large house with extensive hot water demand at any one time , you may want to go for a system/ regular boiler . <p> Also if you are on a tight budget , the system conversion will add to the overall costs .

Am I right in thinking that the feed and expansion tank would be installed within the system boiler ?

Often when heating engineers install combi boilers though they will leave existing tanks in place because it is a pain to get them out and also to dispose of them , hence you often have old tanks in the roof if you go from a heat only to a combi boiler . Best thing to do is get a plumber out they will be able to tell you if the hot water tank is still needed but you should most likely be able to do away with it saving you some space . <p> I 'm very confused about what should be a straightforward choice combi or standard replacement boiler ? A plumber just called to service our conventional old boiler and says Go for a combi if your water pressure is good .

Help ! <p> Hi Stewart , A combi would be okay provided you are not using taps / showers at the same time ( as your plumber said provided the water pressure is okay ) . If you use two at the same time the water pressure is halved as the combi sends hot water to both taps , meaning you tend to get a bit of a rubbish shower . <p> To be honest if you have a conventional boiler and it works , then you will be absolutely fine sticking with it just replacing the boiler unit with a new more efficient version . <p> Hi Susan , the cheapest will probably be a regular heat-only boiler . These also use a hot water tank so therefore it will require minimal changes to your existing pipework although obviously the boiler will need to be sited somewhere else . <p> If the property is relatively small ( only 1 bathroom ) then you may wish to install a combi boiler these do away with the hot water tank so you could save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the kitchen in the old chimney breast but there is no flue at all .

We currently have a system boiler ( with header tank and hot water tank which is also run with an immersun giving us free hot water all through summer .

Which is cheaper option ? ? <p> Hi Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems combi , system and regular ( also sometimes known as heat-only ) . All new boilers are condensing that means they recycle the heat in the waste gases so all three types of boiler will be as efficient . <p> The combi will give you hot water on demand , but if your boiler breaks you wont have any backup ( so normally the immersion unit on system / regular boiler ) . Having said that the fact you are n't  storing hot water is obviously a plus in terms of efficiency . <p> Install wise , it would be cheaper to stick with a conventional boiler than swap to a system boiler ( which is pressurised and needs a special tank ) or combi . <p> I have 8 old radiators in my semi detached house , built in 1988 , should i go for a combi or concentional boiler ?

Buyer beware ! ! <p> you must be mad to replace the old hot water tank with a new combi. when the combi fails you have NO hot water and NO heating . nothing. ! invariably the thing with take several days to fix and all the time you have no heat. ! with the old sytem , you will have hot water if the boiler fails . when you have children some hot water is far better than none . <p> We have a 3 bed terrace house with a conventional boiler ( in the kitchen ) we do n't  want to move the boiler and are not worried about having the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boiler and use the existing pipework , therefore not disturbing the rest of the house ?

Its anything from 99sqm to 121sqm One EPC said we have 6 ? of loft insulation , when we actually have 14 ? of loft insulation . The bungalow was built in 1992 and has insulated floors , which is about 3 ? + thick . I 've seen it when we 've had new radiators put in . All the EPCs assume no floor insulation .

So I 'd be sceptical of any EPC , better to go with the homebuyer report . <p> Thanks , James !

We have a combi boiler , it works well but there is a long pipe run to the kitchen tap , and hence it takes an age to get hot water once we turn on the tap , also wasting ( metered ) water . I realise we can instead install an electric multipoint heater under the kitchen tap to give quicker hot water . But I 'm not sure if this can be installed on the hot supply . The logic being that the multipoint heats the cold dead water in the hot water pipe , but when the gas heated water comes along it switches off . Or is this me trying to save tiny amounts of energy and thinking of an unworkable setup , is it best just to stick to using a multipoint fed by the cold supply ? Any advice much appreciated . <p> I was thinking like Mike above when I wanted a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my gas heated system rather than heat from cold with electric ? There was no sensible answer any more than reasoning that a booster heater would be needed for a Combi with a long pipe run . You can waste gallons of cold or warmish water waiting for a good temperature then it can scald because you wanted the temperature setting higher to carry on filling a bath now -+ full of cold water . A lot of rubbish is talked about under savings including the low-energy lighting topic ( scam ) which suggested you could save -100s by switching as soon as possible . Bear in mind that when energy companies talk about efficiencies they are talking about energy IN versus heat ( or light ) OUT . No allowance is made for the efficiency of providing the customer with what they wanted in terms of usability or convenience . So you might for instance save GAS but waste water or other earth resources at some other remote expense ( e.g. minerals , mining , shipping , unsustainable or unethical production or manufacturing methods etc ) , IMHO . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of working well in my flat two bed two bath which I 'm renting .

There are a few grant schemes out there to help pay for a new boiler however , one is based on your income and will depend on what benefits you claim , the other is open to anyone and is called GDHIF you do need to get another ( usually expensive ) measure installed along with the boiler to be able to get this grant money however . It usually is n't worth it unless you are making some wholesale changes to the house . <p> I am buying a house with an old Gas multipoint for the hot water and a boiler on a inside wall in a bedroom . ( I assume its not a condensing boiler but it got 4 stars on the EPC , its more than the fully double glazed windows got ) . The EPC and the homebuyer survey are contradicting each other .

I would tend to agree with the Homebuyer Report surveyor but without the EPC recommending a condensing boiler I ca n't be eligible for the new green Deal Home Improvement Fund . What do you suggest ? <p> Hi Marie , I recommend going for the cavity wall insulation and new boiler as the two measures provided the cost of getting the cavity wall insulation is less than -1250 . The reason for this is that you can get cavity wall insulation for free from many companies ( ourselves included ) . However since the grant is -1250 via GDHIF , provided the cost of the cavity wall insulation is less than this , you are essentially getting grant money to pay for some of the install costs of the boiler . <p> If these do n't  show up as recommendations on the EPC , you will need to get a Green Deal Report done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via GDHIF you get a -100 rebate .

My water seems to tak a very , very long time to heat up , sometimes upto 10 minutes which wastes a lot of water and i am fearing a high water bill . Could this be down to the boiler ? Thanks , John <p> Hi John , your water bills will only go up if you are on a water meter ( if you are you should check out some water saving products ) .

@@36748788 @5748788/ <h> Comparing infrared heating with storage heaters <h> April 15 , 2016 <p> Many people rely on electrical heating to keep their homes nice and warm during the colder winter months . Despite the fact the cost of a unit of electricity is 3x the cost of gas ( so electric heating is far more expensive than gas ) there are a few benefits of electric heating . Firstly it is easy to install and maintenance is very limited " you are never going to get a leak from your electrical heating system ! Also you can localise your heating much more effectively without the need for sophisticated heating controls . You can simply turn your electric heating on in the room you are currently sitting in . Obviously this is pretty basic , but for many people it is all that is required . <p> In the UK , there are a huge number of properties that are heated with storage heaters , but infrared heating is becoming more and more popular as an alternative electrical heating system . In the following article we are going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heating system . <h> The history of storage heaters <p> Storage heaters were first introduced in the 1960/1970s when the UK invested heavily in nuclear power plants . These power plants could n't be switched off , so continued to produce electricity 24/7 . Now as you might imagine , the demand for electricity between midnight and 6am is far lower than the rest of the day because most of us are asleep . It was a result of this lack of demand ( but plenty of supply ) that led to the formation of the Economy 7 tariff . This was a dual electricity tariff , where one is charged less for electricity during the night ( normally midnight through to 7am ) and then a higher tariff comes into play during the day ( from 7am through to midnight ) . <p> The idea was that a storage heater would charge during the night and then release the heat during the day . The electricity at night would be used to heat bricks in a very well insulated core " this heat was then allowed to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage heater technology has improved immeasurably , with improved efficiency and far less heat leakage . This leakage was one of the major downsides of older storage heaters ( heat was often lost during the day , so if you wanted to warm your house in the evening the storage heaters had lost their charge ) . - <h> The history of infrared heaters <p> Infrared heaters were introduced around the same time as storage heaters , in the 1960s/1970s . These heaters tended to use near infrared , the radiation closest to red on the light spectrum . These could carry a large amount of heat , ( which you may have experienced if you have ever stood under one of those bar heaters ) , and were often installed to replace coal fires . The issue with them is they could get dangerously- hot ( approximately 13000c ) so were not ideal in a- residential setting . They were more commonly found in workshops and factories . With the introduction of full central heating systems in the 1970s , demand for near infrared heaters all but died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research was carried out looking at far infrared . Unlike near infrared , which glows orange/red and is extremely hot ( approximately 13000c ) , far infrared heaters emit much lower temperatures , ( typically 1000c ) and there is no visible light ( the elements do n't glow ) . While the heat is much less intense , far infrared is absorbed especially well by humans , because we have such high water composition . As such , these have become increasingly popular as an- alternative to storage heaters . <h> How do storage heaters work ? <p> Storage heaters are typically composed of clay bricks or other ceramic materials . These have electrical heating elements inside them that get hot when electricity passes through them , which in turn heats the bricks . As discussed , in an ideal setup , the storage heaters are- charged- during the night and then this heat is released during the day as convection heat . Convection is where you feel warm because the air is warm ; this is- the type of heating found in most homes since radiators also use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is cold or draughty , convection heat tends to be lost very quickly. - <h> How do infrared heaters work ? <p> Unlike storage heaters/radiators that produce convection heat , the reason you feel warm when you stand in front of an infrared heater is radiant heat . Radiant heat passes through the air and heats solid objects directly . The sun heats through the same mechanism and this is the reason you can still feel nice and warm if the sun is out even in the middle of winter . It is also worth pointing out that infrared heat is 100% safe " people can get nervous about radiant heating because it is also known as- infrared radiation ( a word that understandably rings alarm bells ) . There really is no need to worry though since it has nothing to do with either ultraviolet radiation ( which gives you a sunburn and damages your skin ) or atomic radiation ( the kind from a nuclear bomb ) . Far infrared is completely safe and in fact there is research to suggest- it can - have positive impacts- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid objects rather than the air means that to get an equivalent level of thermal comfort you can use a much lower rated infrared heater compared to a storage heater . Typically , 1000w of storage heater would provide the same level of heating as 570w of infrared heating . This could lead to big energy savings . <h> From -279.99 <h> The cost of storage heaters <p> We get a huge amount of interest from people who currently have storage heaters looking to replace their old units with new ones . They are often surprised though when we talk about the costs associated with replacing them . The Dimplex Quantum storage heater range starts at about -700 ( for the unit " not including installation by an electrician ) . These are top of the range units there are obviously cheaper types of storage heater available but even so the starting prices are about -350 . <h> The cost of infrared heaters <p> There is a huge range of infrared heaters " so the price really depends on the brand and the look of the panel . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200w unit you are looking at a price of -400 , but for a big 1200w unit you are looking at a list price of just over -1,000 . If you want an entry model far infrared heater then you can get your hands on one for just -200 . <h> The look of storage heaters compared to infrared heaters <p> There really is only one winner here " and that is the infrared heaters . Unfortunately based on the fact storage heaters need to have big ceramic/brick cores , they will always be pretty bulky . Infrared heaters on the other hand can come in many different styles depending on what you are looking for ; it is even possible to get a family portrait or your favourite photo printed on them ! Most infrared heaters are very thin ( normally just 2cm thick ) which means they do n't take up nearly as much space as storage heaters , so if space is at a premium then infrared is definitely the way to go . They can also have dual functionality " for example I have an infrared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat , it obviously also acts as a mirror ( without steaming up ! ) . <h> The future of storage heaters <p> Personally I think the Economy 7 tariff wo n't be around for that much longer " I think the premise of them is great and if you are willing to invest in a top end unit then you will have a great heater with great controls . The truth is though that as the nature of our electricity mix changes ( with more focus on renewables and gas ) there will be less electricity available at night as the energy producers will look to match supply with demand . Most of our nuclear power plants and coal power plants are due to close in the next 10 years and these are the plants that we ca n't switch off at night , so unless they are going to be replaced with like for like plants then Economy 7 will sadly be no more ! <p> As such , my advice would be to move away from storage heaters " unless you are creating your own electricity ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be very high capacity e.g. 3kw or more , so while they are okay to charge under the current Economy 7 tariff because you are charging them during the night on the cheaper tariff - if that gets scrapped then they are going to be extremely costly to charge . <h> The future of infrared heaters <p> Infrared heaters are an efficient form of electric heating , therefore their future seems pretty secure . Electric heating is never going to be for everyone . Many people in the UK have central heating systems ( boilers and radiators ) and to be honest we would never recommend someone rip out their central heating system and replace it with any form of electrical heating as it will likely cost them more to run in the future . However saying that there are a huge number of properties that are simply not able to have central heating systems . <p> For those with ageing storage heating who are considering replacing them , I would certainly recommend looking at infrared simply because they are smaller than storage heaters ( and in my opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far cheaper to run . <p> If you have any questions on either of these types of heating systems then please drop a comment in the comments section at the bottom of this page and one of the team will try to come back to you ASAP . <h> Installing infrared heating <p> Are you thinking local installer to help install infrared heating in your home , just fill in the form below and we will be in touch shortly ! 184576 @qwx384576 184572 @qwx384572 <h> 13 comments <p> I live in a 3 bedroom house where electricity is our only fuel ( no gas main ) .

As the heaters emit the infrared , the solid objects warm up and release the heat back into the room , so the air temperature will increase , but you will be thermally comfortable at a lot lower temperature ( as per the reading on the thermostat ) compared with a convection heater e.g. just 16-17 degrees . <p> Hi .

The house is facing to the west . <p> Hi , a combi boiler wont have a hot water tank therefore this set up is not ideal . You would be better off installing a regular ( heat-only ) boiler these produce the hot water for your home and also provide heating via radiators . The advantage here is that you could install a dual feed hot water tank this would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is unlikely your existing hot water storage tank would be able to handle both feeds . <p> It is important not to confuse combi boilers with condensing boilers combi boilers are a type of water that produce hot water on demand ( there is not hot water storage tank ) . All new boilers are condensing boilers ( so combi condensing or heat only condensing ) this simply refers to the fact that they reuse the heat in the exhaust gases so makes the boilers more efficient . 
@@36748794 @5748794/ <h> Biogas Energy <h> Renewables <h> What is biogas energy ? <p> This section is about the use of biogas- in industry for the purpose- of energy creation ( heat and electricity ) and/or non-transport fuel that can be released back into the grid for general public use . <p> Biogas is produced via a process called- Anaerobic Digestion ( AD ) , which results in the production of numerous gases that can then be burnt to produce energy . Anaerobic digestion is the breakdown of various plant and animal material ( known as biomass ) by bacteria in an oxygen-free environment . For example , the waste plant material is sealed in an airtight container , then bacteria is added , which is encouraged to multiply and grow , releasing methane and other gases as the by-product of the process . In addition , there are other by-products produced in the process which are rich in nutrients and can be used as fertiliser . The inputs in the process can be any number of biomass materials including any of the following : food waste , energy crops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process can take on waste from households , supermarkets and industry , therefore reducing the waste that goes to landfill . <p> The two major gases that make up biogas are methane ( CH4 ) , which accounts for about 60%-70% of the total and also carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) which accounts for 30%-40% . Small traces of other gases can be found . Overall the way biogas is composed depends on the inputs or feedstock that goes into the AD process . In industry , biogas can be enhanced to filter out pure methane and removing other gases , which then becomes- biomethane . <h> Biogas energy and industrial uses <h> Heat-only biogas energy <p> Biogas can simply be burned through the combustion process to produce heat only . When burned , one cubic metre of biogas produces around 2.0/2.5 kWh of thermal energy. - A proportion of the heat generated in the plant can be used first hand to power the digester and the nearby buildings . The remaining heat is discharged , and unless it is then heating and transferring hot water through a local pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concept of heating water and transferring to homes as part of central heating is popular in some Scandinavian countries . <p> In the UK , to increase the concept of district heating , requires investment in new infrastructure . The generators that make this upfront investment can hopefully by the end of 2012 , make good use of the- Renewable Heat Incentive- support . <h> Electricity-only biogas energy <p> Electricity can be generated from the combustion of biogas , which is a relatively simple process , but this requires an upgrade of the plant . Electricity is easier to transport and measure than heat and gas supply , but requires the infrastructure to feed into the grid , which is not simple and may be expensive . Generating green electricity can benefit the generators ( households and communities ) by making the use of - Feed-in Tariffs- ( FiTs ) or for bigger players can maximise the- Renewable Obligation Certificates- ( ROCs ) for industrial scale production . <h> Combined heat and power ( CHP ) biogas energy <p> CHP or- cogeneration- is a process that simultaneously produces useable heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants more efficient than other conventional power plants , as the process to create the various gases requires heat , therefore less is wasted . In addition to then generating the heat , the plants also generate electricity , which is transported and sold like the excess heat . If generators can support the cogeneration process , then they are able to make good use of the- RHI , - FiTs- and- ROCs- available to them . <h> Biomethane liquid biogas energy <p> Biogas needs to be purified by extracting out the carbon dioxide and trace gases , therefore making a purer form of methane which then becomes biomethane . In the UK , the process of purification has to take place for it to be acceptable in the gas grid , where the gases are dried and upgraded to a higher methane content ( upwards of 95% ) so it then resembles the qualities of natural gas . This approach is already followed in the- US , and other Western European countries . Refer to the- National Grid- for more information and supporting documentation that look at maximising the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that when the- RHI- scheme is finalised , it will not only include support payments for biogas combustion ( see above ) , but biomethane injection too as a consumption fuel for homes and businesses . <h> Biomethane transport fuel biogas energy <p> Biogas energy , like the process for domestic heating fuel , can be cleaned further from other gases ( carbon dioxide and trace gases ) , then upgraded to a pure form of biomethane and used as transport fuel . Biogas is eligible for support under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation . <p> The combustion of biomethane from vehicles are more environmentally friendly than that of burning of transport fuels such as modern petrol and diesel , thereby helping reduce greenhouse emissions . Examples of renewable transport fuels in vehicles that are formed out of biogas are compressed natural gas ( CNG ) or liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) . In the UK , the number of vehicles that are CNG or LNG is a relatively low percentage compared to Germany and Sweden . As the number of of vehicles using CNG and LNG is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicles , such as refuelling stations , is also therefore less developed than some of those countries mentioned . <h> Biogas energy policy development <p> Biogas energy has n't really taken off as a fuel alternative as of yet in the UK . This is partly due to the lack of infrastructure to support its development and secondly , more importantly , there is a lot uncertainty from the government around the- RHI . Generators do not yet know what is actually going to form part of this scheme and the level of support that will be given to both fuel and combustion . Biogas energy generation is more expensive than conventional fossil fuels that enjoy benefits of scale and lower fuel price . The government needs to support these generators if they want the investment to happen and the price to come down in the long term . <p> Smaller scale producers currently benefit from the FiTs and larger scale producers from the ROCs ( only for electricity generation on the assumption the AD facility has been completed post 15th- July 2009 ) . If you are an accredited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit from the Renewables Obligation , if you are not already doing so . To find out more information and how to benefit from renewable obligation , please visit- OFGEM . <h> Benefits <p> Rich leftover products that can be harnessed as fertiliser . <p> Biogas creation is made from plant and animal waste that would otherwise end up in landfill sites . <p> Biogas power plants can make use FiT and ROCs for electricity generation and RHI for heating . <p> Biomethane ( from biogas ) is a fuel that powers CNG or LNG vehicles , emits less greenhouse gases . <p> Purifying biogas by removing CO2 and trace gases , turns the gas into biomethane which can be used as alternative for domestic consumption . <p> With a piping infrastructure , biogas power plants can provide heating to local communities and districts that is greener and more sustainable . <p> Biogas power plants are more efficient in using the heat they generate than conventional coal , oil and gas plants . 184564 @qwx384564 <p> Electricity distribution start-up costs can be high as requires the producer to connect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Local infrastructure needs to be upgraded , which may be costly , so that heat generated can be effectively passed to homes as a central heating solution . <p> In the UK the volume of CHG and LNG vehicles is relatively low compared to countries like Germany and Sweden . <p> If the plant was built pre-July 2009 , the producer will not be able to benefit from FiT and RHI . <p> Poor choice of feedstock will mean poor yields of biogas . <p> Ensure regular supply of feedstock , otherwise this may lead to large variations in production . <h> 3 comments <p> Hi Carey , are you looking for bottled Biogas or mains biogas ? Biogas can be scrubbed and fed into the mains , but this happens on a very small scale . Also remember you will be getting your gas from the closest mains gas terminal even if you did find a supplier , it is unlikely even if you paid them for their supply that the gas that would be coming into your home would be from that source . 
@@36748795 @5748795/ <h> Looking for a more intelligent heating control system ? <h> April 21 , 2016 <h> Are the old dial thermostats destined for the scrapheap ? <p> For most of us , the room thermostat is a simple dial on the wall that allows you ( in theory at least ) to control the temperature of the home . I say in theory because during our home surveys we go into a great number of homes who actually have their thermostats turned up to 300c , but the house very rarely gets anywhere near that sort of temperature . <h> The downsides of a classic room thermostat <p> Now " do n't get me wrong , thermostats are a fantastic invention , but they are pretty limited . We go into homes where the thermostat is situated right by the front door . It is exposed to an almost constant stream of cold air , which means that the thermostat is will invariably send a signal to the boiler to fire up since it is recording the ambient temperature as very low . <p> One of the other most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wall is not exactly the most efficient way to control the temperature of a home with 10 radiators . It is also incredibly manual " you need to move the dial each time you want to adjust the temperature . <p> Our independently commissioned research also shows that achieving the desired temperature for everyone in the household is a tough ask " in fact constantly moving the thermostat dial and changing habitable room temperature frequently sets off bickering in the home . <h> Intelligent heating controls " the smarter way to heat your home is here ! <p> A new breed of thermostat and heating control is available for the home " one that will allow for the busy modern life ; varying temperatures between the outside and inside ; variability between rooms and some will even learn about your habits too ! <p> So if you have an old thermostat " like the one you can see in the picture to the right , you may be better off replacing it today ! <h> What is the best intelligent heating control system for me ? <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rest of this blog we are going to look at each of those available and try and draw out the key features and limitations of each based on their basic functionality , intelligence and zoning capabilities ( ability to heat different parts of the house to different temperatures ) " hopefully this will give you some decent insight to shape your purchasing decision . <h> What are the current comparable intelligent heating control products on the market ? <p> There are a few really intelligent heating systems available " of which you will have probably heard of some- Nest " which was recently bought by Google and Hive from British Gas , which is currently getting heavily advertised , in the British press . Others- are the Heat Genius and the Honeywell evohome , so- scroll down to read more about them . We like Netatmo products . <p> We know that there have been other intelligent heating systems released since we first wrote this to- get our take on them , click on the link above . <h> Nest Intelligent Thermostat <p> At the beginning of 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which point their only product was the Nest Intelligent Thermostat and Nest Protect , a speaking smoke alarm . This suggested to us at least , that intelligent heating controls have a hugely bright future . The product is now available in the UK , following the announcement in April 2014 , whereby Nest is also closely working with NPower to target the distribution to some of their energy customers . <p> Essentially the Nest Intelligent thermostat is like your existing thermostat albeit a very advanced version . On the simplest level , you can move swipe your finger over the touch sensitive screen to change the temperature up and down like a traditional thermostat . <p> Once installed , the Nest Intelligent thermostat will begin to learn your heating patterns as you manually change them over the first couple of weeks and develop an auto " schedule to automatically do this going forward . <p> The thermostat also has temperature , humidity , activity and light sensors behind the sensor window , to help it react more intelligently to changing conditions , for example it will turn off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help save on your heating bills . It will also take into account the impact of direct sunlight falling on the unit and still read and set the correct temperature . <p> In addition the thermostat can also be remotely controlled " having the capability to work with both Apple and mobile Android software , so on your tablet , computer and phone you can check usage and operate it away from your home . The great thing about the nest is that it has the capability to communicate with the broadband router without an additional dongle that many of the other intelligent heating systems have . This means you only need the two units the thermostat itself and the receiver that plugs directly into the boiler . <p> The product itself is quite easy to install , if you have some experience of changing a light fitting or performed basic electrical DIY in the house . At the moment there is a really easy to follow how to ' video on the Nest website , but this is designed for the US market " although a UK version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the- Nest thermostat the first is that it will only control the hot water that is used to heat your home , not the hot water the comes out of the taps ( which is an issue for heat only boilers ) . The second is that it needs to be plugged in to an electrical circuit at all times , there is no battery backup . <p> It currently retails at -180 as a standalone unit or -250 with professional installation . <h> The British Gas Hive <p> Next on the list is the Hive Intelligent heating system from British Gas . If you live in UK , I am sure you will have seen all the press coverage for this product " British gas are obviously keen to exploit the gap in the market before the Nest makes its way over to these shores ! <p> So , the actual hardware is sold as part of the Hive Active Heating Kit ' , which essentially includes the following items : the receiver which is installed by an engineer to the boiler ; a wireless thermostat ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to control the wireless thermostat with a computer app . <p> The Hive app , just like all the other intelligent heating control systems allows the household to control their heating remotely from any part of the country ( internet signal permitting ) . So if you happen to be out and about and want to get home to a toasty warm house , then you simply log into the software on your phone " both Android and iPhone , and turn up the heating . <p> In the end the Hive is ultimately a thermostat that limits heating to one zone . It is also not smart like the Nest , so apart from the anti-frost control it does n't track the heating habits of the home and all the settings are adjusted manually . <p> So , although the Nest Intelligent Thermostat is not yet available in UK , were it to be offered at a similar price as the Hive , we reckon the Hive would struggle to compete with it on pure functionality . However this being the first model , we anticipate that further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functionality shortfalls . <p> The one big advantage of the Hive over the Nest is that you can control the hot water using the system , so for those with a Heat Only boiler ( i.e. a hot water tank ) , this might be a welcome addition . <h> Tado <p> The Tado is a fairly neat and straightforward system allowing you to control the temperature and the heating on/off times . The set-up is pretty simple , comprising of three pieces of kit " the Tado box , the Tado connector for your broadband and finally , the temperature motion sensor . <p> If you have a room thermostat already , you can simply wire the Tado box directly into this . If you do n't have a thermostat then you will need to wire the Tado box directly into the heating system . Most of the existing boilers will be fine to connect to , but if you are unsure refer to the Tado website for more information . <p> The Tado connector then slots into one of the usb slots at the back of your router @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature motion sensor should be placed in an area that you intend to spend most of your habitable or living time . When this is plugged in , you simply fire up the app on your apple / android system and you are ready to start setting up your heating schedule and target temperature . <p> The Tado <p> From here the device will work like any other thermostat " the heating will come on an off when you tell it to do so and if the room reaches its target temperature the boiler will turn off . <p> The key issue with the Tado intelligent thermostat is that you need an app to change the heating pattern or set your virtual thermostat . Unlike the Nest device or Hive systems , there is no way of seeing the temperature on any of the Tado kit supplied - you will need the app working on your phone or table to see this in real time . So , if you feel a little bit uncomfortable with this method then there are other systems you should consider . <h> FROM -194.99 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it has geofencing functionality ( like the Honeywell Lyric ) " the system will know who is in the house ( based on the apps on their phone ) and will heat the property accordingly . As soon as everyone has left the property ( provided they remember their phones ) , the boiler will turn down as it will assume there is no one home to benefit from the heating quite scary , but intelligent nevertheless and maybe the next step in home automation ! <h> Honeywell evohome <p> Many of our readers will probably be familiar with Honeywell , already having one of their basic Honeywell thermostat installed in their homes . The evohome is certainly an evolutionary ' step away from these old thermostats though , since it allows the user to set up heating zones in their home , all of which can be set at different temperatures to one another for an even greater level of heating control " just like the Hive and Nest , the evohome can also be controlled remotely with a phone app . <p> The company has tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been playing catch-up somewhat in this rapidly expanding consumer techy ' market . <p> The evohome product itself has to be wired to the central heating system . From that you have the central controller , which communicates to both the boiler unit and Thermostatic radiator valves ( TRVs ) that can be fitted onto the individual radiators in the rooms that you want to control for each base unit you can create a maximum of 12 heating zones . <p> The central controller can then be controlled manually or remotely with the right software application . The neat aspect of the evohome controller is that it can be fixed to the wall like your existing thermostat or acts as a standalone like tablet that you can take around the house with you . However unlike the Heat Genius or the Nest Intelligent Thermostat this particular model does not learn user habits . <p> It is certainly not the cheapest model on the market , starting at -372 for the basic starter pack and the mobile access kit , but this assumes the home is one zone " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have multiple zones , it works out about -69 per radiator or per TRV purchased . <p> We know that there have been other intelligent heating systems released since we first wrote this to- get our take on them , click on the link above . <h> What do we think about the savings of having an intelligent heating system installed ? <p> Going through various assertions of manufacturers talking about savings of 20% or more " personally we think these are pie in the sky ' figures as it all entirely depends on the fabric and insulation of your existing property . If you have a poorly insulated home for example , then the idea of having a thermostat control the temperature of that are become redundant as in reality that room may never reach the desired level . So actually you are no better off as your existing heating system struggles to keep your home at the temperature that you want . <p> Also the savings will only result if you actually incorporate behaviours that make you think about the temperature and on-and-off times " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . If you are one of those folks that keeps the thermostat at 300c , then no matter how smart ' your thermostatic control system is , you will struggle to see the savings come through . <h> 35 comments <p> I 've tried a number of these systems but none of them pass what I ( in a rather sexist way ! ) call The Wife Test . My latest trial is with the LIghtwaveRF products . Despite it being made apparently by Siemens the room thermostat is a REALLY flaky device and so hard to read because of a very cheap LCD screen . It does the same as a number of systems linking using the house WIFI to wireless TRVs and in theory you can set the temperature in every room at any day/time good as we have some rooms that are little used . In practice it has a schedule for the main thermostat to bring on boiler so while you can set individual schedules they are dependent on the main thermostat . What would be ideal for most UK houses which have very simplistic single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just integrated the demand from all the TRVs and if any room needed heating the boiler would come on and when none need heat it goes off . then you really could just set your heating schedules per room . You also need to be able to easily bump up the temperature in a room by pressing a button hour boos sort of thing . So while the schedule programming should be done on an app there needs to be a physical interface in the room . <p> For those who are looking for water radiator thermostats . I have recently bumped into this eCozy company dealing with smart heating system and found them interesting . If you want a good an reliable and most importantly smart heating system feel free to check them out . It is a German startup eCozy GmbH . Really high quality staff they have not to mention their design is fantastic = <p> most people have a half decent rad based system . some with TRV and some not . The cost of a SMART system is basically at least -1000 especially if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh why do they have to be integrated with another controller . I just want an app ( for free ) that links to as many smart-wifi-TRVs that install myself , maybe -50--70 each . Each smart TRV also needs to transmit its battery status . is that too much to ask ? <p> Am thinking about a heating/hot water control system . Present system has a timer on the boiler and thermostat radiator valves . Not happy about leaving system on for 24hour heating as it tends to leave the house too warm . Switching off overnight however tends to make the system work harder to heat up the home especially in colder weather . Am thinking about nest or hive . Would either of these allow me to leave system on all the time but give me the added flexibility of having it at a lower temperature overnight to make it more comfortable and not have it work hard to set up a comfortable environment at all times ? <p> Have a look at Pi Therm. ( google it ) You can program it in various ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raspberry Pi microcomputer which is very inexpensive , compared with proprietary ones <p> I agree , smart TRVs are like having a smart thermostat in every room or zone at a fraction of the price &amp; no wiring involved . Have you seen Radmiser now have the Open Window sensors as well ? These will turn down the heat on the specified radiator if the window is opened and then turn it up again once the window is closed ! ! That should make the kids more energy saving aware when their bedrooms get chilly ! ! <p> As most systems rely on thermostatic radiator valves to control room temperature , I fail to see much benefit in the Nest and Hive systems that use a single thermostat to regulate the temperature of a house . Perhaps the greater benefit is to BT and Google who then have access to your behaviour data that they can sell on to 3rd parties . <p> Evohome uses motorised thermostatic radiator valves and room sensors/controls and there are cheaper models out there . However , when I last looked at this , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to be interoperable so that you can use it with any compatible controller and the controller can be directly accessed from a PC or any mobile device without publishing that you are on holiday for 2 weeks to a 3rd party service . <p> Hi PJL , anything that helps homeowners keep more on top of their heating is a good thing surely ? Not only because it will save them money ( it is very easy if you can turn down heating from your phone ) but also it helps us use less gas collectively as a nation . <p> I have recently installed a biomass boiler , and I would love to have it controlled by smartphone technology , however the installer has told me that none of the smart technology will work for a biomass boiler , as it operates differently to how my previous oil boiler operates , e.g. it wants to remain on for a longer time than that of the oil boiler , is this true ? <p> interesting post , thank you . I was wondering though if you know any manufacturer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program through the wifi lan od the home ( 69pounds per valve as on the evo system seems to me an overkill ) <p> I have just ordered five smart TRVs from Reichelt ( in Germany ) for under 100 UKP which price includes VAT and shipping . It will be interesting to see if I can control them from my iPhone , which they claim is OK . <p> I used to have the honeywell system , but then I got electric radiators , which are much more efficient , and these can also be controlled by an app too , I got mine from Intelli Heat , who were really helpful . The app also controls my lighting and garage door at the moment as well . <p> I have a two level semi and have apartments upstairs and on the lower level . Both are walk outs . The central furnace for AC and heat are controlled by the upstairs thermostat . How best can I control the AC on the lower level since cold air drops . I was thinking of a temperature sensitive wall ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level . I was thinking of a Nest thermometer for the upper unit but what good will it be when there are two levels ? <p> I would have to go with Graham on his explanation here but yep , I get Barrys point too . Though the systems are useful , you , as the owner , also need to make sure that it works for you by doing your best to conserve on consumption . <p> There are heating controllers more intelligent than that ! My current system is able to measure the temperature inside each room and heat each room individually only when its used . If there 's nobody in , let 's say the lounge between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m because I 'm home alone and work from home in my study , there 's no point heating all rooms and waste energy . I would also like to say that I am trying to conserve as much energy as possible , not only because of our energy bills but I 'm trying to do my bit to the environment and give an example to my children . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house sometime next year and Ive already questioned the guys from Heat Genius ( this is where I got my heating control from ) regarding what will happen with my system if I move house . I was really pleased to find out that I will be able to take it with me and just re-fit it in my new property . Before I got this system I had looked at other heating controllers , such as EvoHome or Nest , but either the installation process was too long or the system did n't  do what I wanted . <p> You need to be aware that not all these systems are an investment in your home when you come to sell it . Taken from the Hive FAQs : " If I buy Hive and then move home what should I do ? n++If you are moving house and have Hive Active HeatingG installed , please leave all of your Hive kit ( boiler module , thermostat , hub and any SmartPlugs ) at your old house . They form part of your central heating system and must be left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has Hive Active HeatingG installed , what should I do ? n++Firstly unplug the hub from your broadband router but keep it plugged in at the power socket , this help maintain the thermostat 's range in the home . If there is a SmartPlug in the home switch this on too . You 'll be able to control your heating and hot water manually from the thermostat on the wall but you wont be able to control your heating remotely from the Hive app , online dashboard or by text . If you 'd like to use Hive Active HeatingG to control your heating remotely , you 'll need to buy a new Hive hub " <p> All this about intelligent controls , and nothing about whether any of them are an on-off stat or a sensor-controller . The difference being that the latter actually measures the temperature , predicts how much heat is required and then instructs a modulating boiler to turn down the flow temperature to efficiently match the heat demand. ? These products , and this article , are nothing more than froth and bubble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are is fancy on-off devices . <p> bought a heat genius , but they cancelled my Peter order because a dared to complain about the level of service I was getting after they took my money then never installed the equipment . poor company with very bad attitude <p> the argument about intelligent heating is similar to hybrid cars what do you want your system to achieve.some want all electric some want hybrid Lexus . or the Toyota Pios I started by trying to get basement bedroom warm in the morning . The hot air was shutting off the heating before the bedrooms were warm ( delicate wife ) i worked out that if I could time the rad valves I could leave the upstairs rooms switched off until the bedrooms were warm . I found a German firm called eQ3 and using their maxi system I was able to put a wirelessly controlled time and temperature programmable rad valve on my existing trv valve bases by using a wireless hub i was able to program them and control them remotely . i also found that if i put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get an accurate temperature.Finally i decided to time control all the other minor rooms bathroom , en suite . it cost me about -50 per room with one rad and -75 with 2 rads plus one hub at -54 the minor rooms have non wireless motorized valves at -10 each so my flat cost about -320 in total it was very easy to retrofit by myself . the only aspect not covered is direct communication from the rooms to the boiler so i still rely on the boiler thermostat and clock for some functions . how ever if i was brave i could leave the boiler on continuously and leave it to my new system.but as the object was to save money within the existing parameters . I have left the thermostat and the boiler timing alone . Now None of my rooms is every heated unnecessarily and none exceededs the desired temperature . And they are always comfortable when I am in them . If i need to I can override the system with a comfort or boost command I also have an eco switch by the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system can be controlled via the web or phone or tablet it even has a holiday mode . I reckon for me this is about the most cost effective and interesting solution . but someone else might find they could just use the -10 programmable valves . Some one else may want direct response from the boiler there are people who do this but at serious cost . I am 66 and I would never get my money back . <p> I have to say that I really believe I 'll get my money back . One month ago a I had the Heat Genius system installed and I 'm really glad I chose it . I was a bit skeptical at first , as I was n't sure how much money you can save unless you are really cold in your own house . But now , because I also have the sensors installed I can see on my phone when a room is heated and when is not and this way I 'm saving energy . I think generally speaking , smart thermostats are easier to use and its a good way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Barry is missing the point . Let 's say your annual heating bill is -1200 and it costs -2000 to fit the system . Using Barry analogy it will take a long time to pay for itself . But if we get say a 20% reduction in energy costs then that is a saving of -240 per annum . That is a nett return of 12% on my -2000 investment . Where else can I invest -2000 and get this type of return , a return that will actually increase every time the fuel prices increase .. Also when one comes to sell the house this type is system makes the house more attractive to potential buyers . It may help sell the house at a better price.or just make the property more attractive to potential buyers over the other houses they are looking at . <p> If you could get your -2,000 " investment " back , then it would be a 12% return . But its a depreciating asset that really needs for something leading edge and electronic such as this to be depreciated over five years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You should always remember that you have to get your costs back first before you start saving anything at all . A -400 bill for supplying and installing a clever heating management system should , at the very least , save you -40 a year over 10 yearsor it has actually COST you money . -40 a year may be 7% of your heating bill . If it does n't  definitely save you more than this then its a worthless piece of plastic on your wall . <p> Smart heating control systems have become increasingly popular since the beginning of this , so its to be expected that many people will have questions about this new way of controlling heating . <p> Agree with this line : " savings will only result if you actually incorporate behaviours that make you think about the temperature and on-and-off times " . The whole purpose of these heating systems is to make it easier for household to control their heating . Some systems can learn users habits and give them the best options for saving energy i.e. which times heating should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

The hot water tank stores the hot water as the boiler produces it , which you can then use as and when you need it . <p> On the face of it , storing large volumes of hot water is not particularly efficient , since if you do n't use it , it will quite quickly get cold . It is the same principle as boiling a kettle . The more water in the kettle , the more expensive it will be to boil it . There is no point boiling an entire kettle of hot water for one cup of tea , since the rest of the water will quickly cool down and therefore it will waste money . <p> The major advantage of this type of boiler ( + hot water tank setup ) over newer combi boilers ( which produce hot water on demand ) , is that you can still get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a combi boiler breaks down you will have no hot water " that is the bottom line !

Heating with gas will be far cheaper than heating with electricity . Just turn down the radiators in the rooms you are n't  using . Similarly to think of deliberately using an immersion heater for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuts , it will be far more expensive . <p> Hi . I have been using the top element in my immersion heater for several years now . The bottom element which I understand is the economy 7 one was switched off due to a problem which I now think was because it was on a timer set outside the economy 7 hours when no electricity was coming through ! The top element is on a timer for one hour in morning abd one hour at night which generally suits my needs for showers , washing up etc . A bath will take 2.5 hours of heating and does n't  produce a full bath . What I am curious about is whether my top element is in fact heating the whole tank or just the top half and so I will never get as much hot water as if the bottom was heating up over night , coming on via Economy 7 ? This may seem a daft question ! <p> Hi Louise , It is unusual to ever get a whole tank of hot water basically the element heats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot water floats to the top of the tank . When you run the tap , this hot water travels to the tap from the top of the tank and cold water replaces it at the bottom of the tank . So basically it is irrelevant where the elements enter the tank ! <p> But importantly it is worth heating the hot water tank on the cheaper evening tariff if you are on economy 7 , and a jacket is certainly worth investing in to try to limit heat loss through the cylinder itself . <p> I have just come across this . We have a 120l tank with an immersion heater . I have left it on for the last month . Our electricity was probably -5 a month more than with it off , It is hard to say accurately at this moment as we have a oil fired boiler for heating and of course that uses electricity as well . So far I have found that the immersion is miles cheaper than gas for heating water . And even more cost effective than using the boiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to have the heating on to get hot water . <p> Hi Groom , The Economy 7 cheaper rate period typically falls at somepoint between 10pm and 8.30am , but that period can vary across the country . i.e it could be from 11pm until 6am . You need to check with your energy supplier but provided you are turning on the immersion during these hours then you should n't have a problem . When people are on economy 7 , they often have two immersion elements linked through into the hot water tank one which is for the cheaper night time tariff and the other which is for the evening tariff , in which case provided the cheaper tariff immersion is on , you should never pay a premium rate for producing hot water . <p> This depends on a few things firstly the size of the immersion element ( typically 3kw in megaflo ) . It also depends on the temperature you want to heat the water too but typically we recommend between 50 degrees and 65 degrees although Legionella is killed at 60 , so ideally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if you normally heat it only to 50 degrees centigrade . The last thing is the starting temperature , becuase obviously the higher the starting temp the quicker it will heat up . In this example let 's use a starting temp of 20 degrees ( so roughly room temperature ) and heat to 60 degrees , using the 3kw immersion . This would take about 3 and a half hours to heat up and would use about 10.25kWh of electricity , which at 12 pence per unit would cost -1.23 . Hope that helps ! <p> Hi , we have just bought a house which runs from Immersion hot water and economy 7 storage heaters only . We are unsure how the immersion is controlled but we are definitely on the economy 7 night / day rates for the house . <p> there is a single on off switch about mid way up the hot water tank upstairs . should this be left on or turned on and off as required ? <p> ALso down in the kitchen there appears to be two further controls and we are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> one has switch options ( almost looks like light switches ) these are labelled on / off ( should this one be left on all the time or as and when required ? ) , and to its right another labelled sink / bath . <p> Then above this , there is another control this time labelled economy 7 ( looks pretty 1980s vintage ) with a dial for summer/ winter and timer , an on / off button and a boost 1 hour dial .. <p> Which switches should we be using , and which should be left alone ? any help would be much appreciated we are so confused Thanks <p> Can you tell me , please , if it is possible to have a short top immersion heater in the hot-water tank , to heat a small amount of water for washing up and hand-washing , and a bottom immersion heater to switch on , only when wanting to fill the bath ? This would would save having to heat the whole of the tank of water , when only a small amount of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a property which only has electric . The water tank has two switches top immersion and bottom immersion the lettings agency turned the top on and left it on , but i was a little worried leaving either switch on will incur high costs . There is no timer so I ca n't put the hot water on a timer so I have been turning the switch on and off which is very annoying . Is this necessary or is there another way ? <p> This tends to be for when you are on an Economy 7 meter i.e. you pay two different rates for your electricity . A cheaper night time rate ( approx 6-7p / kWh ) then a more expensive day rate 15-17p / kWh . <p> What happens is that the two immersion elements are using the two different rates . In an ideal world , you are heating the water using the cheaper night time rate electricity . You then leave the day time immersion off and use it purely as a boost function if you happen to use all the hot water in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all the time , the immersion units have thermostats to ensure that they do n't  heat the water to an excessive temperature , so you shouldnt be paying too much for it to be on , although you may wish to insulate the tank further to minimise heat loss if possible . <p> The switch is on if it is in at the bottom . The heater is on if the light on the switch is on . The heater is on if there is a noise coming from the tank . There is also an expansion pipe because as water heats up it expands and needs to be returned to the cold water tank . if you feel this pipe it will give you a good indication as to how hot the water is . <p> There is either a switch ( which when you turn on turns the immersion on ) or they are sometimes on a timer if this is the case there should be clock somewhere near the immersion unit that you can then use to dictate when the immersion heater comes on . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimplex electric panel heating system and an electric immersion heater .

I have a standard gas boiler and an insulated HW cylinder with top immersion heater . I prefer a combi boiler , but plumber has said the standard is more efficient to run underfloor heating , and if I get a new cylinder with bottom immersion , I can heat water free in the day . I think this is a waste , and am thinking of localised hw heaters at sink and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the existing inefficient cylinder and boiler , both only 4 years old , then I have saved a lot of money in new equipment . <p> I only have an immersion heater , no boiler .

In addition you need to put your immersion on a timer a 3kW immersion element will cost about 40p to run each hour and 1 hour should be sufficient to heat a cold tank up to temperature . I would therefore suggest running this just for an hour in the morning and an hour in the evening bringing the cost down to just 80p . Getting a basic timer on the immersion would allow you to set this up rather than having it running all day ( unless you are happy to do this manually ) . <p> Hi we just moved into a new property and were told that the heating was an immersion heater and gas central heating , we have a tank for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard working , The problem we have is , the hot water must be set to the same time as the heating , how do we know if its gas or electric Emerson supplying the heating ?

Thanks . <p> Our rented house has a hot water tank with an immersion heater .. We have no gas in the house .

We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is there any way we can reduce the price of our hot water ? <p> Hi I have an immersion tank do n't  know much about them , the switch is on and you only get a quarter of bath full of hot water however it is a small tank but does not sound or fell like water or much is in the tank itself what could be the issue ? <p> Hi , my flat which is privately rented has an electric immersion heater only as no gas supply . The pipe ( overflow ? ) which leads outside the flat seems to be leaking since I turned the water off to have a washing machine installed as had the wrong stop connector ! ! <p> Me , and a couple with an 8 months baby have just moved into a property which has both boiler and immersion . Also , the master bedroom is en suite and the shower has a pump which gives a really good flow of water . <p> The problem is when we use the boiler to heat up water , hot water is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suite . what could be the problem here ? <p> The second issue is that in order for the central heating to operate , we have to switch on the hot water as well . Does this make any sense , because in all other properties i have been the hot water and central heating were operating independently . <p> Hi I have recently put my electricity metre readings into my energy account and had a massive shock with the amount I have been charged for my electricity . I live in a rented flat and there is no boiler only an immersion heater . We had it on continuously for six months without knowing how much it costs . I have read the information provided here and I understand putting a timer on the heater , is there a timer already fitted to the heater or do I have to purchase on ? The immersion heater is not plugged into a socket , there is just a switch like a light switch so ca n't add a timer plug . Also how long does the water in the tank stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour or so ? <p> As a long since retired gas engineer , I 'm not sure I entirely agree with some of the replies . Of course the immersion should be controlled by a time switch , but leaving it on all day , or even all night to , wo n't cost the absolute fortune digested . A well insulated storage tank will loose about 2kw per day , or about 30p although perhaps poor plumbing might increase this . Then there is the question of thermostat settings . Current advice is to keep the setting low , to reduce the afore 2kw heat loss , BUT and its a big but , if you find yourself washing under a running tap , or running the tap for long periods waiting for the water to become hot , that 's not actually cold water that 's going down the drain , but hot water that has gone cold , and its being replaced with cold water at the cylinder , which you will now have to heat . My advice would be to set the thermostat so that the water is actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to collect the initially cold water , knowing that the following hot water will bring it up to the temperature you actually want . And one final point . When comparing relative costs , I assume we are talking about town gas because LPG is considerably more expensive . <p> Even a well insulated foam encapsulated hot water cyinder can lose about 2 units ( 2 KWH ) of electricity per day , often referred to as standing loss . The tank our builder put into our new house about 10 years ago only seems to be very poor only having about 25 mm of insulation on it and the inside of our airing cupboard was always very warm . For about -15 I have cut the hot water heating costs considerably . Firstly I have covered all the hot pipes with foam pipe insuation ( cut with a sharp kitchen knife and mitre the corners on pipe bends for a neat job ) occasionaly held in place with insulation tape . I then bought a 75 mm tie on foam jacket from screwfix it is in six panels so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immersion heater but take the insulation round it . So my tank now has 100 mm insulation and now only a warm , but not hot airing cuboard . <p> Hi Paul , It sounds like you immersion is on 24/7 . This is not a great idea ! Find the plug for the immersion and switch it off ! You only need this on for an hour or so to heat a full tank of water . Keeping it on all the time is like continuously boiling a kettle . <p> After that you are going to need to give us a bit more detail electric boilers are very unusual . You normally get gas boilers with hot water tanks that have electric immersion backup . If you have no electricity in your home then yes the immersion is going to be producing your hot water but ideally this should be put on a timer so it comes on for just a couple of hours a day to help minimise your energy bills ! <p> My one bedroom flat only has an immersion heater , no boiler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot water for a couple of hours after work each day ( 6-8pm ) . I had it on for two weeks straight without realising the potential cost so have now turned it off and will only switch it on for a couple of hours when I get home each night so I can wash etc. is this the most cost effective way ? Another query which is linked to the above is that my flat has storage heaters which i think must run from the immersion heater ? If so is there no way of having the flat warm when u get home without leaving the immersion on all day ? I get such mixed opinions from people its crazy . I do n't  like coming home to a cold flat and having to wait for the water to warm up but at the same time I cant afford to leave it on all day ! Thanks in advance . <p> From what I can tell , you have an immersion heater to produce your hot water and then storage heaters to provide your heating . These are completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work with the Economy 7 tariff , where the rate you buy electricity at night is cheaper than the rate you pay during the day . They charge during this cheap period and the electricity is used to heat bricks and the theory is that this heat is retained until it is needed within the heater hence the output dial on the storage heater , this sets the rate at which the heaters give up their heat once charged . The main issue with the older storage heaters is that by the time you want the heat , it tends to have leaked out , which means you need to recharge them . <p> In terms of the immersion , again this runs off electricity . Based on the fact you are on economy 7 ( am I assuming that based on the storage heaters ) , you should definitely heat the hot water during the night maybe from 4am 6am . This means that it will cost less to charge because the electricity is cheaper . This should provide all the hot water you need for the day to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway insulated ) . If you then need more hot water , just flick the immersion on for an hour or so . <p> Marcia the light you are referring to on the switch on the wall adjacent to the immersion heater , if it is then it sounds as though your switchfuse is faulty and will need replacing . I would suggest you contact a competent electrician to get it tested and if necessary replaced . <p> Hi Good post with logically flown thoughts on using immersion heater ! I have 2 kw solar panels and with the summer setting in I will have output from them more enough to run other devices probably another immersion heating tank itself ! Now we have switching devices in the market that can manage the excess power . I saw solarimmersion in my friends neighbours home .

Recently I purchased a Solar iBoost that is wired between your immersion heater switch isolater and immersion heater . There is a wireless transmitter fitted adjacent to your electric meter that sends information to the Solar iBoost .

It is great , even on a resonable sunnny day I get a tank full of hot water .

I have to manually turn the boiler on as the control panel has broken so I am therefore unable to set it to come on early in the morning . Would it be more cost efficient to leave the boiler on all night ( but turn the heating off ) or put the emmersion heater on when I go to bed . To have the boiler and the heating on at the same time does n't  heat the water efficiently . Thank you ! <p> Hello , I wonder if you can help . My parents have no boiler/central heating . They have an immersion for hot water . They definitely need central heating putting in , would they be able to qualify for any of the free boiler offers ? Would be grateful for any advice . <p> Hello again , Alan Have just received a reply to the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; as follows : Generally the answer is yes , it is all to do with the return temperature when using external 230V controls and the boiler maximum flow temperature is set to 75- . If the return was to come back at 55- it would be condensing but when it gets closer to the maximum it will stop condensing , this is when there is a benefit in using Vaillant controls you can range rate the cylinder kW output , maximum temperature and cylinder offset which will keep the boiler condensing for longer . <p> Hi . We have just bought our first home and the set up is very old ( we bought it from an old lady who lived there for 39 years ! ) <p> It is all electric and there is no gas supply in the street . We have night storage heaters and a hot water tank/immersion heater , but no boiler . The shower is electric so heats up itself , but what settings would you recommend for us to use please ? eg timer , temperature etc There are only 2 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the dishes etc . <p> Hi Chris , congratulations on the new home ! In terms of this set up , it is quite common , so the first thing is the storage heaters these charge during the night on cheap electricity and then emit the heat during the day . The first thing to check ( if you want to keep the storage heaters ) is that you are on an Economy 7 tariff that gives you access to the cheaper electricity . Provided you are , you need to charge them during the hours that the electricity is cheap . You then control the heat output , so normally people will try and coincide this with when you come home from work ( ideally just before so the home has a bit of time to warm up ) . In terms of hot water , provided the hot water tank is insulated , you should be okay using the immersion for one hour a day . You might prefer 30 mins in the morning ( so it is warm when you wake up ) and then an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you are at home during the day , storage heaters can be very expensive since electricity is more expensive than gas to heat the home , so if this is the case you might want to consider the switch . Let us know how you get on ! ! <p> This is a really useful article . We had exactly this problem with our immersion heater . Told the kids to use in case of emergencies and then as soon as the shower got cold they would flick it on and then forget they had done it . This has happened about 10 times now so need to find a way to stop it ! ! <p> Hi Tina , Thanks for your comment . I see so many properties where the immersion is left on and forgotten about it is like pouring money down the drain . You should n't really need to turn it on unless the boiler packs up , it just takes a little bit of discipline timing your showers always a problem with kids ! <p> I have a 125 litre Heatrae Sadia Megaflo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fed the electrical supply from the element into a basic timer ( Fused spur timeswitch ) by TimeGuard . I am on economy 7 with OVO at approx 6p kwh night , 12p day and have my immersion on for 1 hour at 4am in the morning which allows me and my wife 2 medium length showers each per day , sometimes I use the one hour boost . Great system and efficient as it can be with a timer on it <p> With regard to Barrys comments on underfloor heating I will cover that on the other blog . <p> Hi Nikky , it depends on the starting temp of the cold water and the end temperature you are looking to achieve . Normally the immersion units are 3kW , so the formula is <p> Volume of tank x 4 x temperature rise / 3412 <p> So it would be 125 x 4 x 50 / 3412 ( where 50 is the temperature you want to raise the water by and 4 &amp; 3412 are constants ) <p> This is 7.3kW required which with a 3kW immersion would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14p / kWh , so per hour it would cost 42p to run therefore you are looking at about 80p . <p> Obviously the key is to really well insulate the tank and then you do n't  need to worry so much , because the temperature you will need to raise the water by will never be 50 degrees because the water in the tank will still be warm . <p> There are a few problems with the accuracy of this article , and I 'll address the principle two : <p> First of all , an electric shower is NOT expensive . On average a five-minute shower with a 10kW shower will cost under 11p . Indeed , its even possible to pay just under 8p for a five-minute shower with a typical 8.5 kW shower . <p> Secondly , electric immersion heaters are not necessarily expensive at all . We get a years hot water by daytime electric immersion for just -219 a year . This gives us four showers a day , plus hand-washing . Its all about control . You should always put an immersion heater on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of year . <p> The cheapness of our hot water costs show why hot water solar panels can actually cost you money , not save it even when that water is heated by daytime electricity . We would NEVER retrieve the costs back from a hot water solar panel array ! <p> I was advised by my plumber recently that the cheapest way of heating the water for me , living most of the time in a house on my own , is not to use the boiler but to keep the immersion heater on contstantly , as he said it takes very little electricity to keep it hot , and much more to heat it up from cold . This sounds different from your advice . Could you give me your reaction , please ? <p> Hi Dione , So we would definitely not advise leaving your immersion heater on 24/7 . This is because it is heating your water using kWh priced at around 13p . Whereas if you used your boiler it would be around 3-4p . Immersion heaters should only really be used when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost due to high usage . For maximum efficiency make sure you have a cylinder thermostat so the water is n't being heated beyond the required temperature . <p> There is one more fact that has been omitted in these discussions . Whereas gas for central heating is indeed about a quarter of the cost of electricity , in a condenser boiler , the water heating is not as efficient as the central heating . Hot water is produced at around 55% efficiency compared with around 89% for C/H . If this is true , then an immersion heater will cost only around twice as much as gas . Gas still has the edge cost-wise , of course , but not by so much and the convenience of a hot water cylinder is , as explained worth the extra if used as a top=up for hot water in the cylinder . <p> Alan , No my point did not include heat loss from the pipework from heating to tank . I was informed by my boiler installer that when the system calls for hot water to be produced , the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to contact Vaillant which produced my boiler , for confirmation or otherwise of this comment : so far without an answer . <p> Mark , You make an interesting point . Do you have anything to back up the 55% efficiency assertion ? I am assuming you are referring to the loss of heat from the pipework from heating to the tank ? I find it hard to believe that you will get a 35% drop in efficiency just by transferring the water to the tank . Any losses from storage in the tank will be the same if heated by the immersion or the gas , so it would only be heat lost during transport that you are referring to ? <p> Dione , Absolutely make sure the tank is well insulated that is a good point . Never , ever leave your immersion on . Not only is it more expensive per unit , but it will just keep boiling away all night costing you a fortune . I have seen people who have made this mistake spend a thousand pounds on electricity in a quarter !

Do not look to undertake any work under the influence of alcohol ! <h> Measuring the size of your rafter coverage <p> After you have cleared bulky objects , you will be able to see the area more clearly . When measuring your loft space here is a simple guide : <p> Take a measuring device ( tape measure or a laser measure ) and measure the rafter area " this can be done by measuring from the apex of the roof down to where the sloping roof meets the horizontal joists and multiplying by the breadth of the roof . <p> Take into consideration the thickness you want to insulate " it is recommended you insulate to at least 100mm to get the optimal performance <p> Measure the width of your rafters " this is important if you are thinking of insulating below the rafters <p> Write down these measurements on a piece of paper and then take them with you to a DIY shop to buy the insulation or- order the materials online . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material you will need to measure and leave a space of about 50mm between the roof ( breathable membrane or tiled ) and your insulating material so air can travel freely through , otherwise you could have issues with condensation and damp . <p> The best way is to get treated timber to use as battens . Use the battens as a gauge , leaving about 50mm gap , and then fix them to the sides of the rafters using a nail gun . <p> The depth of rafter will obviously influence the thickness of insulation you can fit between them , but you can always extend the rafter by attaching a wooden extension to it , since the more insulation you can fit in place , the warmer the loft space will be . <p> When handling wool , ensure you take enough rolls with you into your loft space . Use scissors to cut through the packaging and lay out the material . You will need to start at the top , stapling the wool material to the sides of rafters on each side . Carry on fixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will need to have your dimensions correctly mapped out as you need to have material that covers the width of the rafter space . <p> Make sure the insulation is 50mm below the actual roof , which can be done using the battens as your measuring gauge for the breathable area between the roof and the insulating material . <p> Depending how deep your rafter is you may be able to fit two layers of 100mm thick wool insulation . To ensure bits do n't fall off you can then attach a layer of netting that will ensure the material is further supported from the forces of gravity . <p> At this point , if you are bothered about- aesthetics you can fix a thin layer of plasterboard to the bottom of the rafters ( with the material already snuggly fitted between them ) , and paint over it . Although you will lose you some headroom , it does improve the visuals of the place . <p> Your rigid boards will need to be cut to fit the gaps between the rafters . When they are cut ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it could be stapled to the rafters . The wooden battens that sit further in the rafter will act as an automatic stabiliser , so the boards could easily sit on top of them . <p> Again make sure you select the right thickness of the material so you fill as much of the rafter gap as possible . To ensure you do n't have bits flying off you can get sheets of see-through film and staple it to the underside of the rafters . <p> Using rigid boards as opposed to wool is a much more precise process , as the cuttings need to be almost perfect to snugly fit rather than the wool , where your material can be folded and moulded to fit into the rafter space . If you are in doubt please consult a professional . <p> When you use solid insulation board to create a warm loft the key thing to remember is ventilation " you must keep a 50mm gap between the roof and the rigid insulation board . We would always recommend having a breathable membrane in place between the tiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If there is no vapour layer it might result in damp issues , since the warm air may condense in the loft space on cold surfaces . Water and timber do n't work too well together and it could result in the timbers rotting . <p> The best way to achieve the gap is to attach some dowel batons on the inside of the rafters so you can then butt the insulation board up to them ensuring the 50mm gap is still in place . If you measure the thickness of the rafter , then less the 50mm gap " this is the thickness of the rigid board you want to put between the rafters . By doing this the insulation board will then not protrude out past the outside edge of the rafters , which means that you can then very simply attach more insulation boards , fixing them directly to the rafters to achieve the required depth of insulation . <h> What materials can you use to insulate below the rafters ? <p> If you have shallow rafters or just do n't care about losing the headroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the much easier way to insulate at rafter level . Here you do n't have issues with condensation or worrying about leaving a gap in the roof membrane . <p> Your rigid boards will need to be cut with some logic so that you can move from one side of the roof to the other . Insulation boards come in different sizes , and as long as you figure out a plan as to how you will cover the rafter space then you should be fine . <p> You need to nail them to the underside of the rafters to ensure they can be fixed . You can use a nail gun or a conventional hammer and nails to do this . If you are using a nail gun , ensure that you handle it with care . <p> At this point you may also decide that it is sensible to do this as a lone ranger . Having someone there holding the material in place while you fix the edges will ensure the process is more efficient . In addition having a fresh pair of eyes and hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> At the end you may want to put a decorative finish by covering with a thin layer of plasterboard and painting a finish . <p> Installing reflective foil <p> The reflective foil installation is the easiest of the processes , however the thermal insulation result is the poorest . <p> Unroll the material and start on one side of the loft . Staple the foil to the underside of the rafter , ensuring as you roll-out the material you staple to all the rafters . You will eventually get to the other side of the room having covered a level with this insulating material . <p> You either now move onto the other direction of the loft or you position the foil below or above the level you have just insulated . The idea is that by the end of the process you would have covered the whole loft space . <h> 2 comments <p> It is stated that a 50mm gap must be left between insulation board ( I am using Wickes Easy Fit insulation panels ) and the roof , membrane or tiles . Loft Conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there is no underfelt as the tiles themselves will expel the air . Which is correct ? <p> When you insulate the rafters , is it worth doubling up with some foil insulation over the top of the celotex or rockwool ? I want to make sure I have done enough but there is n't any more room or depth to the rafters . 
@@36748798 @5748798/ <h> How to run your storage heaters efficiently using Economy 7 <h> February 26 , 2014 <p> Update : - As nuclear and coal stations are wound down in the UK , this could mean the death of the Economy 7 tariff . This would mean storage heaters becoming more expensive to run , and as such we no longer recommend people install new storage heaters . Read our latest advice here- under The future of storage heaters . <h> Economy 7 and storage heaters <p> To make the most of a storage heater , you need to be on an Economy 7 tariff . Unfortunately , a lot of people do n't know how to best utilise this and end up charging their heaters at the wrong time . <p> The easiest way to understand storage heaters is to visualise them as a big rechargeable battery ; they require charging prior to discharging the energy contained within them . <p> With Economy 7 tariffs , the electricity is supplied to your home at two rates : expensive peak-time ' electricity and cheap off-peak ' electricity . The cheapest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so using the cheap off-peak ' electricity , but it just so happens that this is only available during the middle of the night usually from 12 until 7 in the morning . <p> If you charge the storage heater during the middle of the day then you will be charged the peak rate and this quickly becomes a very expensive way to heat the home . <h> Will storage heaters leak heat ? <p> Unlike a battery that will retain a lot of its charge until required , the storage heater will begin to leak heat almost immediately . Obviously the longer the storage heater can retain the heat , the more useful it is and therefore companies will make you pay more for these products . <p> As a rule of thumb though , a storage heater will lose the majority of its stored heat over a 12 hour period . This means that if you get in from work at 7pm , the majority of useful heat will already have dissipated into the home " so the storage heater will not provide you with the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Obviously this can be mitigated to a certain extent by having a really well insulated house , since the heat ca n't escape the property . However any solid brick or uninsulated cavity wall home is going to struggle . <h> How to set up your storage heater controls <p> Power switches " this determines whether you are using off-peak on peak electricity to charge the storage heater ( remember off-peak is considerably cheaper ! ) <p> Input and Output controls " the input control determines how much electricity the storage heater will use to charge ( and therefore the amount of available heat once the storage heater is charged ) . The output control controls the rate at which the storage heater emits heat into the room . <p> In terms of running the storage heaters in the most effective ( and cheapest ) manner possible , the first thing to ensure is that you do n't use the peak electricity power switch unless absolutely necessary " obviously you do n't  want- to get cold , but try to avoid using this unless in the middle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to make sure the storage heater only charges during off-peak hours . <p> During the winter you will want to set the input control to the maximum " this will allow the most charging power to the storage heater . In the summer you may get away with turning the input control right down ( or even off ) , since you wo n't need much heat for the home . <p> Obviously turning the output control right up will mean that the storage heater does all its heating very early in the morning , so not ideal if you want to be warm in the evenings . If you do get a new storage heater it should retain the heat until mid/late afternoon " it is then that you should- turn up the output , so the house warms for when you get home . <p> Make sure you turn the output to zero when you are not at home or when you go to bed " there is no point releasing the heat as the storage heater charges , since this means that it wo n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will function more as an electric radiator . <h> Solar PV and Storage Heaters <p> Some people ask if it is worth running their storage heaters from electricity generated by solar PV . The answer to this is actually not as straightforward as you would think . <h> FROM -649.99 <p> Firstly , you generally use more- heating during the winter , at a time when your panels are not producing as much electricity as in the summer . Storage heaters require a lot of electricity , and if you had them on all day during the winter , rather than at night , the additional peak rate grid electricity you would need to supplement the solar panels would be prohibitive , unless you had a really big 10kW+ system ( 40 panels ) . <h> Solar PV Optimisers and Storage Heaters <p> Having said that , there are ways you can make solar and storage heaters work for you . Technology like the Apollo Gem or the Optimmersion work by utilising all the leftover unused energy generated by your solar system that would otherwise go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to heat your water , but there is no reason why you can not connect this up to your storage heaters . It wo n't be enough to meet all your heating needs , and you will still need a charging cycle at night , but you could use it to top up your heating during the day , and ensure that you have some useful heat still left when you get home in the evening . <h> Installing storage heaters find you a local installer for storage heaters , just fill in the form below and we will be in touch shortly ! <p> Interested in installing storage heaters ? 184572 @qwx384572 <h> 24 comments <p> My storage heaters come on at 10.30 to 7.30 am . They go off for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using dear rate electricity for the first 2 hours . There is no way on my heaters to control the charging as this is done automaticallyy from my meter . I do n't  want to get up at 12 at night tomturn them on , but my heating bills are too high . Anything I can do please ? <p> Hi Sarah , the first thing to do is ensure that you are not charging the storage heaters during the day , as you will be paying for peak electricity . Next I recommend getting your energy supplier to check the meters are working correctly . Finally ( and this is if funds allow ) you might wish to install new storage heaters to ensure they retain their charge once you charge them at night . <p> I got the part about just charging the unit ( INput on and output off ) at night . but I want to know if the convection control switch can be left set at 20 C ( for cold weather ) and turned on all of the time , or just when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Honeywell " thermostat for forced air ( USA ) so am clueless . Thanks so much . <p> I have dimplex quantum storage heater which has an lcd display to set on and off times but has no input or output dial so I have set on time 12 till 7 i 'm guessing when its on is when it uses electricity . I 'm so confused as there is no input or output dial . <p> Fundamental to storage heaters is the Economy 7 tariff that goes with them . With Economy 7 , you get two rates for electricity 7 hours of cheaper electricity during the night ( when demand in the grid is low ) and then a more expensive rate during the day . <p> Under a normal electricity tariff , each unit of electricity is approximately 11 pence . The cheap rate of the economy 7 tariff is approximately 6 pence , while the expensive rate is 16 pence . <p> So basically a storage heater charges during the time the electricity is cheap . Storage heater contain bricks within them . These are enclosed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heated , they retain the heat . When you want the heat , the insulation jacket is opened allowing the heat to escape , helping to heat the room . <p> The issue with older storage heaters ( aside from their size ) , is that the insulation jackets do n't  tend to be very good , so they leak this stored heat . By the time you want the storage heater to actually heat your home , the bricks are cold ! Therefore people tend to put the boost on to get the heat , but the problem is that this requires electricity and it is at the expensive rate . This is the reason why people tend to look to replace them as they get old ! <p> Anyway hope that explains a little bit more about how the storage heaters work ! <p> Hi Wendy . It depends entirely on your electricity tariff if you are on Economy 7 , it means you have access to off-peak electricity for 7 hours during the night , so it should be a bit cheaper to run your washing machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard tariff , it will be no cheaper to do your washing overnight than in the daytime . <p> I have just moved into a new property with 2 storage heaters . I have spoke to edf today and they have told me that me E&amp; night tariff is from 10:30pm-12:30am the from 2:30am- 7am . My question is please . How do i know when my storage heater is storing heat and that it is in the Night tariff times . My stotage heater only has the input and output knobs and no other dials . I someone can help me with this please . <p> Carlo , Your storage heaters should be on a separate circuit that will only work during those night tariff times . Usually there will be a couple of switches near the heater one will be for day and one for night . But every unit is slightly different , so it might be worth speaking to the manufacturer . <p> When and more inportantly how or even who turns on the power for charging night storage heaters and can we control it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there some sort of power/thermostat switching on/off ? <p> Hiya mr Johnson , I have storage heaters in my flat and I switch them on before I go to bed and then turn the switch off when I get up ! It should be giving you heat all day once its stored over night ! ? I have 2 that have a control on and 2 that just set at a certain temp ! Just make sure you are turning them off in the morning otherwise you will be using a lot of money keeping them running all day every day ! Hope this helps Xx <p> I have a storage heater in my bungalow with nothing but a power switch on the wall no dials or controls when turned on it does nothing no heat this is a new building any ideas ime a pensioner and cant get answers from anyone . . ? <p> Mr. Johnson . check your fuse box and ascertain that the fuses are all pushed in . At the same time look at the meter face , it will show a high read out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no Economy seven ( which would be unusual in a new build ) .

These are made from 100% pure and natural sheep wool for the excluder and recycled plastic for the handle . Siting snuggly in the chimney , they provide the perfect barrier between the cold outside and the warm indoors .

@@36748802 @5748802/ <h> How much does external wall insulation cost ? <h> January 18 , 2016 <p> We have discussed external wall insulation a few times on this site , but we often get callers interested in EWI who then baulk when they hear the cost of the work . We want to make sure you are fully aware of what sort of costs are associated so I have come up with some guidelines and rules of thumb you can use to get an idea . <h> Size of your home <p> The simplest way to get an idea of cost is to look at the type of house you have . A detached house will typically cost -15-20,000 to completely insulate , a semi detached house -8-10,000 , whilst a mid terrace is probably -6-8,000 . The final figure will vary depending on just how much wall you have . <p> Type of Property <p> Estimated Cost of External Wall Insulation <p> Detached <p> -15 to -20,000 <p> Semi-detached <p> -8 to 10,000 <p> Terraced <p> -6 to -8,000 <h> Wall area <p> A slightly more accurate way to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall area that is going to need insulating . One of the London based installers we interviewed , Be Constructive , tell us that the average cost of one of their jobs is about -100/square meter . That means for a 60 square meter job , the cost is going to be -6,000 . <p> Customers often exclude windows and doors from this area however , and that will probably lead to an underestimation of cost . Unfortunately it is much easier to insulate a wall with no windows , as adding in that detailing around the windows and creating a nice clean finish around the reveals takes a lot more work . As a result , we recommend measuring the whole wall from ground to gutter and end to end to come up with your square meterage . <h> Extension work and fixings <p> Usually the cost we have indicated here will cover pipe extension work and the usual fixing you have on your wall . If you have a lot of complicated fixings , or you need to get a gas appliance flue extended you could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete those works . <h> Cost of materials <p> Materials usually do n't add much to the cost of the works " they are relatively inexpensive compared to the cost of the labour . There are some situations where materials cost will affect the price : <p> Type of insulation material - Rockwool is sometimes preferred by architects and builders as the material is more breathable and less messy to work with than other options . It will add 20-30% to the cost of a typical job however . <p> Double or Panzer Mesh " Using two layers of mesh or an extra strength Panzer Mesh ' will add around 20% to the cost of the job " this is only usually used in areas where impacts on the wall are more likely to happen , like on a wall next to a public pavement . <p> Scaffold " Scaffold can get very pricey , and will vary from job to job . On the average semi detached property , a scaffold contractor might charge -1,500 if the job is relatively straight forward . If there are more than 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstacles in the way " like a conservatory for example , then the cost will increase . For an average job , Be Constructive will include this cost in the -100/m price , but more expensive scaffold jobs will add to the overall cost . <p> Multiple colours and detailing- If you want to go for a very dark colour , or you want to add in detailing or extra features in multiple colours , the cost is going to go up accordingly .

Or perhaps you are pre-empting all those problems by changing your boiler before it gives up the ghost . Either way , knowing how much you should expect to pay for a new boiler is a bit tricky . <p> Why does one person get a new boiler for under -2,000 and another for -4,000 ? In this blog , we want to give you an idea of some of the costs involved , and what makes some jobs more expensive than others . <h> The boiler <p> Determining the cost of a boiler install is unfortunately not a simple business ; it depends on a variety of different things . Firstly it depends on the size of the boiler you are installing " a small flat for example will require a much smaller boiler than a large house and the unit itself will be a few hundred pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition it depends on what type of boiler you had originally and what type of boiler you are swapping to . On the whole there are two types of boiler " a regular boiler ( with the hot water tank ) and a combi boiler that makes hot water on demand ( without a hot water tank ) . Approximate starting prices are discussed below : <p> If you are keeping the same type of boiler ( e.g. if you have a existing combi boiler you are replacing it with a new combi ) , the price to buy and install it will start at about -1300 provided there are- no real- plumbing adjustments required . As a guide , the price of installing a new boiler is approximately -600 -1000 and then you will need to pay for the boiler on top of that . <p> If you want to swap a regular boiler with a combi boiler unfortunately there will be a lot of pipework changes needed ( although you will be doing away with your hot water tank ! ) , so the price to buy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> All the prices listed above are starting prices " the final prices will be impacted by all the factors discussed below . <h> Gas pressure <p> Your heating engineer should always check the gas pressure going in to the boiler , because if this is insufficient , it could cause you problems . One of the issues that often comes up is where too narrow a pipe is used to take the gas from the mains at the meter to the boiler ( usually to cut costs ) . If you have a narrow pipe coming out of your meter ( 15mm or less ) you could have an extra cost on your hands . <h> Moving a boiler <p> Unfortunately , there are occasions- when moving the position of the boiler will be necessary . If you have an old floor-mounted boiler , a back boiler , or simply a boiler in an unsuitable position ( ideally boilers are now situated on external walls ) the job will require significant rerouting of pipework and the further you have to move it , the more expensive the job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation has changed dramatically , meaning a boiler installation 30 years ago will likely not meet current standards . If your flue is dispersing waste gas into a street for example , you may need a plume diverter to ensure people are n't affected by the emissions . If your boiler is mounted in the centre of the house with the flue going up the chimney , this will no longer meet the regulations , and as such the boiler will need a new position on an external facing wall . <p> So you want your new boiler in exactly the same place chances are you will be swapping an old conventional boiler with no condense pipe for a new condensing model , and as such , a condense pipe will need to run to a downpipe , sink or gutter . The difficulty involved here will also add to the cost of the job . You may even have an old asbestos flue , in which case you will need a specialist in to remove the material before the boiler can be installed . <h> Radiators and heating controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job more expensive . Fortunately , it is not normally necessary to change them , and it is really easy to remove an old tank if you are switching to a combi . We would always recommend getting heating controls " which includes as a minimum a programmer and thermostat , but we would also suggest thermostatic valves on the radiators ( known as TRVs ) where the property is larger . <p> As an approximate guide , a programmer and thermostat will cost you a couple of hundred pounds , and each TRV for each radiator will cost about -50 .

Does it really cost -800 to install a boiler ? I thought it only took one day to install ? <p> Hi LTV111 a new boiler does cost about -1000 to buy , but there are lots of little extras that boiler engineers install that does impact the cost of the boiler. i.e. most boiler installers now install a Magnaclean as part of the install to help minimise build up of gunk in the boiler ( which should improve the lifespan of the boiler ) . Likewise the cost of a new boiler also changes depending on where it is currently located i.e. if the old boiler needs to be moved then this will really add to the cost .

It worked out very well . the new Valiant boiler came with a 7 year guarantee and the plumber who installed it was extremely friendly and also he cleaned as he went . Would strongly recommend getting greenage to get you a quote if you are looking for a new replacement boiler . <p> We live in a flat down near maidstone .

Is it possible to sell the boiler as it still has guarantee etc and if so where would we sell it ?

Much appriciated Rachael <p> Hi Rachael , are you replacing the tank as well ? As this depends a little whether you have a heat only boiler set up as a system boiler ( with external expansion vessel ) or you actually have a system boiler ? The cost of the boiler will be approximately -1000 ( for a decent brand , give or take a -100 ) and to install this will cost an additional -700 -1500 depending where you are in the country . <p> Hi Russell , it depends on a few things firstly the type of boiler you want to install .

Provided you go for a mid range boiler and the boiler can be sited in the same place and you do n't  need to alter the gas run then the price of a new combi boiler is going to be approximately -1,600 . <p> Hi Liam , That depends on a lot of things , but for a combi swap you will probably be looking at somewhere in the region of -2,000 2,500 depending on the installer and the type of boiler you go for ( if in doubt go Worcester Bosch or Vaillant and you wo n't go too far wrong ) . When installing a new boiler the most important thing is to make sure the installer is gas safe that seriously is the most important thing . <p> My first boiler was installed by British Gas in 1970 and the flue installed , I think , asbestos is treble insulated and painted .

C.Kaminski <p> Hi Asha If a boiler is being replaced with a similar boiler then the job will only take a couple of hours . If a new boiler is being installed and needs a flue through a wall and more pipework it should be done in two days . <p> This is a great help ! I assume you can get gas safe installers who are n't  VAT registered so you can save yourself a few hundred quid there on the cost of getting a new boiler installed . What about warranties ?

And in what order ? What provides the best cost benefit ? <p> All is revealed below , but we have n't gone in to too much detail . Click on the hyperlinks to take you to different parts of the website , where you can learn much more about the particular item/s you have an interest in . Enjoy and as always let us know what you think in the comments below ! <h> The Thermal Envelope <p> Give or take , about 25% of the heat produced by your boiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About 35% of the heat will escape through the walls and through gaps , in and around windows and doors , and about 10% of heat will disappear through the floor . Collectively the roof , walls ( + windows and doors ) and the floor are known as the thermal envelope . <p> If you can slow this movement of heat from inside the house , through the thermal envelope , to the external environment , you can dramatically reduce your energy bills . In modern houses , building regulations stipulate that homes have to be built to do just that " but how exactly do you go about retrofitting these solutions into older homes ? <h> Stop heat leaving through the roof <p> Install loft insulation in the roof space . This is the no.1 best thing to do for energy efficiency in the home - it is really cheap , easy to do and the payback can be just two years or less . <p> You will need to decide if you want a warm loft or a cool loft , and what exactly you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to store boxes up there or be able to walk around ? ) <p> In addition you need to decide the insulating product you want to use mineral wool , sheep wool , rigid insulating board or even newspaper . There are lots of options for you to consider . <h> Stop heat leaving through the walls <p> As a rule of thumb , properties built prior to 1930 will have solid walls and anything built after will have cavity walls . <p> Cavity walls are incredibly easy to insulate ; the walls are simply injected with insulating material , which slows the movement of heat across it . This is cheap and well worth doing , again with a relatively quick payback " however a professional will need to install this for you . <p> If you have solid walls , things are more complicated " there is no cavity that can be filled , so the walls need to be insulated either externally or internally . This is costly to do , and externally it involves cladding ( so you will lose the feel of the brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will lose some floor space . There is a grant available to help cover some of the costs of getting solid walls insulated " it is called ECO . <p> Insulating your walls is well worth doing since it accounts for the biggest source of heat loss " click on the hyperlinks within the sections above to learn more about the processes involved . <h> Windows " important , but not as influential as you may think ! <p> There are two issues to consider here " firstly think of the area of glazing in your home compared to the area of actual wall . Normally there is substantially more wall area than glazing , so always target the walls first . Secondly , double glazing is expensive " to replace a wooden sash window with a wooden double glazed unit may cost you -1200 PER WINDOW ! <p> So what is the energy saving from changing one single glazed window to double-glazed ? <h> Draught proofing " cheap , cheerful and quick payback <p> Draught proofing is often overlooked , but think about an open chimney in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm air that your radiators have created can simply rise up and out of the chimney .

Insulating floors will stop heat escaping but if you are looking something a little bit more , you can install underfloor heating in conjunction with a traditional boiler , or better still a heat pump . This will allow you to heat the home and do away with radiators forever ! Insulating floors is a relatively simple process and like walls , there are two main types " solid floors and suspended timber .

It is not one to be scared off , it actually simply refers to heat loss . <p> The lower the U-value the better , so an unfilled cavity wall might have a U-value of 2.0 W/m2k , while filling the cavity might take the u-value down to 0.2- W/m2k . <h> Youve done all that what next ? <p> So now you have insulated the home , less heat is going to escape " or at least the rate at which it escapes into the external environment will have slowed . <p> Now it is time to consider the heating system . The more efficient the heating system , the less it will cost to run your house . <p> You might like to consider Biomass boilers , these run on sustainable biomass pellets , so are carbon neutral ' . Installing a biomass boiler will also allow you to take advantage of the RHI . <p> Infrared heating panels are another great way to heat your home . These panels emit infrared ( like the sun " do n't confuse with harmful UV ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that traditional convection heating systems ( radiators ) since they do n't use air as the medium for heat transfer . Instead the infrared will travel until it hits a solid body and then warm that directly . The panels warm up quicker and as soon as they are up to temperature you feel the warmth , compare that to a radiator and how un-reactive that is ! <p> If you only have access to electricity ( no mains gas ) , these infrared panels are definitely worth considering . <p> The reason for this is that you will use the same amount of gas but the heat wont be able to escape . Ideally the heating system turns off automatically- when the temperature reaches a certain point normally about 200c . This means that the boiler ( or whatever heating system you have in place ) will turn off and you wont be continue burning gas unnecessarily . <h> Finally " producing your own energy <p> Everyone likes the idea of being energy self-sufficient .

This combined with energy savings and export tariffs will produce a return of 12% or more " substantially better than a high street bank and guaranteed for 20 years . <p> So there you have it- our whistle-stop tour of how to limit the amount of heat leaving your home , become more energy efficient , save money on bills and do your bit for the environment .

I have all new windows and the attic has been reinsulated . Why am I having trouble heating my home please help <p> Hi Eric . Often it simply comes down to the walls of the property being poorly insulated . Imagine a cube as your house . You have insulated the top face of the cube ( the attic ) but the 4 sides are where the majority of heat loss will occur . These are the areas you really need to concentrate on just because the area of heat loss is so much larger . <p> The issue with this of course is that insulating walls ( espicially if they are not cavity walls ) can be very very expensive . <p> Hi Scott , thanks for your comment . In fact the infographic was never designed to add up , but merely demonstrate graphically where the heat was being lost with associated percentages . Due to design constraints , the representation of draught proofing losses and losses from floors were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls of insulated , however it seems that the insulation was left in a plastic wrapping when it was installed . Is this normal ? And if not is it still possible to get cavity wall insulation ? <p> Hi Stuart , some insulation does live in plastic wrapping once it is installed ( not the packing that it arrives in ! ) it just depends on the make of insulation installed so without this information we would n't be able to tell you . <p> Hi Sam , when you cant inject the cavity ( i.e. for a solid wall house ) you have two options firstly you can insulate the walls internally by adding insulation to the inside surface of the walls . The other and more effective way of insulating a solid wall property is to add 100mm of insulation to the outside surface of the wall . <p> Hi , I have a house where previous to my ownership a few windows were filled in but the builders did not replace the cavity wall insulation ( polysyrene ball ) . I know this as I have used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant find any company who can survey and repair this type of insulation . Its crazy as there must be a lot of houses from the 80 to 2000s who have cavity wall insulation that need to repaired . <p> Hi Simon , if it is only partial repair then it is unlikely companies are going to offer this . We work with South West Insulation and extraction to remove and reinsulate ( properly ! ) cavity walls , but they will normally only do complete extraction prior to re-insulating . <p> Hello Greenage , thanks for this , i was wondering wether there are any grants to help me replace my storage heaters in my home . My husband and i live in a block of flats with no gas , and the heaters are almost as old as i am so sure there is a more efficient way to heat the house . <p> Hi deidre , There is now a grant in the form of the Green Deal Home Improvement Fund that should help cover some of the costs although the maximum payment here is -1000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger than the -1000 on offer , then you can cover the rest with Green Deal finance , to help minimise any upfront costs on your behalf . <p> Really helpful article and interested especially in insulating walls- think our best option is cladding which also looks like the most expensive . Contacted a company and there was some discussion about getting it done before April . Can I ask why if we want cladding installed it has to be done by end of March ? Trying to push company to get it done but they seem to be stalling a little .. not to sure if we should keep the pressure on or if we can relax about it ! ? Thank TheGreenAge ! <p> Hi Lizzie , This is mainly because of the ECO grant , the whole grant system is currently under review by the energy companies , so contracts with the suppliers ( the guys fitting the insulation ) are coming to an end and then will be re-thrashed out around that time . Hence they will want to get as much of the work done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will benefit because the grants will be more generous now than in the future ! I would push them like crazy to get it all installed ! <p> Great blog . Just moved into a new house and it was freezing , despite the fact that my heating was on full blast . Read this blog , have made a few amendments to the gaff and its like a sauna now . Never knew you lost so much heat through your roof ! Cheers Green Age <p> Thanks for sharing such useful information with us .

@@36748806 @5748806/ <h> The Cost of a Solar PV System <h> Renewables <h> How much do solar panels cost ? <p> Solar PV panels have reduced in price by approximately 40% as a result of falling manufacturing costs and competition in the market . This means you can now get a solar PV system installed on your roof for between -4,000 and -7,000 . You can also get payment from the Government for every unit of energy you generate , and for sending what you do n't  use to the National Grid . <h> Eligibility for Solar PV Feed-in Tariff <p> In order to make installing- solar PV more attractive , the Government launched the Feed-in Tariff , which pays households for any electricity produced from the solar PV system . Although payment rates have now been cut drastically , and will no longer pay for the system itself , - the extra money is still a bonus if you would like to generate your own electricity anyway . <h> Export Tariff vs. using the electricity at home <p> To maximise the return from the solar PV installation , you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your home as possible . In the most basic terms , if you use the electricity you produce in the home , then you do n't  need to buy it from your energy provider ( a saving of 12.5p/kWh ) . If you export it , you only get paid a fraction of this- but this is n't actually the main reason to export the electricity . <p> How and when households use their solar PV-generated electricity could be about to change hugely , with big developments in battery storage technology . Read more about it here . <h> Solar PV work financial Examples <p> For someone to be in the 75% and above usage range , they would have to be at home almost constantly throughout the week . Going forward , we are going to assume that the typical user uses about 50% of the electricity they produce and exports the other 50% , but in the table below we have shown the financial implications of home use versus exporting the electricity . <p> So , to start with , we will look at a typical 3kWh system ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirement rating ) and see the annual return , based on the percentage you use in the home versus how much you export . Over a year a 3kW system would expect to be around 90% efficient and generate about 2700 kWh of electricity ( an average home used 4,800 kWh per year ) . <p> Worked Examples % of Electricity used in the Home : % of Electricity Exported to the Grid <p> 100% : 0% <p> 75% : 25% <p> 50% : 50% <p> 25% : 75% <p> Total kWh/year <p> 2700kWh <p> 2700kWh <p> 2700kWh <p> 2700kWh <p> FiT ( 4.43p/kWh ) <p> -120 <p> -120 <p> -120 <p> -120 <p> Used by household ( 12.50p ) <p> -338 <p> -253 <p> -169 <p> -84 <p> Export tariff ( 4.85p ) <p> -0 <p> -30 <p> -61 <p> -91 <p> TOTAL RETURN <p> -458 <p> -373 <p> -289 <p> -204 <p> These numbers are correct as of 23 March 2017 . For the latest rates , click here . <h> What impacts the initial cost of your solar PV installation ? <p> The cost of your solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The size of the installation <p> Obviously the larger the system you install , the more electricity it will produce . The average solar PV system installed in the UK now is 3.5KW , which at 90% will produce approximately 3150kWh of electricity ( depending how much sun you get in your part of the country ) . As reference , an average house uses approximately 4,800kWh . The number of panels you can install will probably be limited by either the amount you can afford or the size of your roof . Suppliers will also charge different prices for their installation services and its important to ensure they are MCS-accredited to qualify for the Feed-in Tariff . <h> 2 . The quality of the solar panels used <p> Not all solar panels are the same ! <p> See our guide to the different types of solar panels for more details , but in a nutshell there are three types : <p> Monocrystalline solar cells ( made from single crystals grown in isolation ) are the most efficient at 15-22% , but they are also the most expensive type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monocrystalline , but their efficiency is far lower at just 13-17% . <p> The cheapest solar cells of all are amorphous solar cells , which also have the- bonus of being more efficient in low-light ( great if you live in the UK ! ) but they are the least efficient overall at 9% . <p> How are the efficiency figures calculated ? Well it is determined by how many watts of power are produced in a square meter . 100% efficiency means that a square meter of panel would create 1,000 watts . Therefore a panel rated at 18% would create 180 watts from every m2 ; - it follows that panels with higher efficiency ratings create more electricity ( per meter squared ) and this is reflected in the price . <p> As you can see in the table above , the actual price of your installation varies depending on the types of panel you get installed , so a 4kW system could cost as little as -5,500 , or as much as -7,000 . <p> System A <p> System B <p> System C <p> Cost <p> -5,500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Poly <p> Mono <p> Efficiency of Panel <p> 9% <p> 15% <p> 20% <p> Output ( kWh ) <p> 3200 <p> 3500 <p> 3700 <p> Feed-in Tariff ( - ) <p> 399 <p> 436 <p> 461 <p> Savings on electricity bill ( - ) <p> 200 <p> 219 <p> 231 <p> 50% electricity exported ( - ) <p> 65 <p> 80 <p> 90 <p> Annual Return ( - ) <p> 664 <p> 735 <p> 782 <h> Payback of your Solar System <p> So having chosen to go for a typical 3.5kW solar PV array for your home , what kind of payback time can you expect ? <p> Well if you were to make -666 a year via Feed-In Tariff ( as in the table 2 above ) , then a -6,000 pound system will payback in 9 years . The Feed-In Tariff is guaranteed for 20 years , the payments are tax free and they are linked to RPI , so will actually increase over time . <p> In addition electricity prices are expected to go up over time , so the 12.5 pence you save for every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase and could be nearer 20 pence in just 5 years therefore the absolute return could actually become bigger . <p> Once you have got your money back ' then any money you make is paid directly to you as profit " so you will be in line to receive 11 years of quarterly payments directly into your bank account " again tax free ! <h> There are a few other costs to think about with Solar PV <h> Maintenance <p> There are maintenance costs associated with your solar PV installation , including- cleaning them at least twice a year to ensure they are working as efficiently as they can . <h> Replacing Inverters <p> In addition , despite the solar panels being good for 20 years plus , the inverters have a lifespan of about 10 years , and replacing these will cost just shy of -1,000 " so factor this in to your calculations when your solar installers give you a quote . <h> Insurance <p> You will need to insure you solar PV array as part of your home insurance , so your insurance premium payments will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your roof does normally not require planning permission , however if you live in a conservation area or world heritage site you will need to speak to your planning authority to get the necessary permission .

Single inverter , not micro inverters which would have added a further -1,200 to the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopefully that should work pretty well . We have calculated the payback of the solar system to be 9 years even though the government payments have dropped from the levels they have been in the past , which seems a pretty smart investment to us ! <p> I think you are missing one element of this investment . Its not an either or with respect to an alternative investment . You HAVE to spend this money on energy services anyway .. The average UK household will spend between -2k--2.5k on energy each year . Its like paying rent . So at the end of 15 years you will be potentially -30k out of pocket with nothing to show for it . With a solar system you are actually -15k to the good if you include spending on something like an air source heat pump to move your gas expenditure to electric heating . <p> We just managed to get our solar PV system installed by Greenage before the cut off date . The system cost -5495 to install and they managed to complete the job in one day ! Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rubbish so hopefully during the summer it will really work well . As a tip for anyone try to get solar system installed by 8th Feb 2016 as there is a huge drop in the government subsidy which means it will take far longer for the system to payback . We had 12 panels ( 3kw ) system installed and the report produced by the system based on size of system , direction the solar panels point and also our location ( Guildford ) we should see payback in approximately 7 years and then we continue to get government money for the following 13 years ( 20 in total ) and obviously the major benefit is the free electricity . We are not the most green household but the solar thing seems like a bit of a no brainier ! <p> With the solar feed-in tariff dropping in Feb ( returns will drop considerably ) if anyone is considering installing solar PV panels on their roofs then they should do this now . The cost of the panels is at an all time low as the article suggests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tariff payment drop is going to make more of a difference . <p> Do remember though that you definitely make most of your electricity during the summer months from your solar PV system . Therefore if you are looking to use the electricity you create to supplement your heating during the cooler winter months you are going to struggle ! <p> Solar PV is definitely worth investing as this article alludes to but as a final comment ensure you go with a reputable company who are MCS certified . You will only be able to claim the feed-in tariff if they are MCS certified . <p> We install solar PV across the UK on thousands of properties and everyone is delighted with the end result . <p> This is such a useful guide . I am very interested in getting solar pv before the tariff drops in January , but had no idea how much they cost . I think i will defintely go for the paid system though rather than the rent a roof scheme becuase I have read if we end up selliung the place the rented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Has anyone got any experinee of this ? <p> Hi Lexie , we still think solar PV is a worthwhile investment even now to be honest . The fact is that the price of installing a system has come down considerably over the last few years so the free electricity ( free in that you do n't  need to buy it from the grid ) goes a long way to covering the cost of the system . Couple this with the FIT payments for both generating and exporting the solar electricity then this is definitely the way to go ! <p> I 've just had installed a 10 panel sun power E20 3.27kw system . The system came with a Geo II unit so obviously I can not keep my eyes of this thing , but what I want to know is today had been a lovely day , sun on panels for hours 19 degrees but my Geo shows a peek of 2.3kw being produced now is that about right as I was thinking it would be up over 3kw can any one help with this ? <p> Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Interested in your assessment of the proposed generation tariff cut to 1.63p in January 16 . My maths tell me that even with a big reduction in total installation cost it is going to hurt the industry badly . Do you agree ? <p> Hi Jon , Obviously it is going to hurt the industry . We have already seen a huge drop in the number of solar PV systems being installed . That being said , demand is always going to be there as energy companies continue to increase energy prices despite underlying gas / oil prices being relatively low to where they have been in the past . <p> I have heard the FIT is dropping in January so I guess this is going to kill solar installs . Another great thing ruined by the bloody tory government . Looks like all there other energy plans are going well though , nuclear plants delayed , no shale gas in sight . <p> Obtaining quotes for a PV array is an utterly fascinating process . One salesman decided our roof was unsuitable because it is too small the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 degrees and the house is 8.2 metres deep . The house faces south west with no obstructions to either the front or back face . I think he had a problem with the maths because the roof terminates in a central ridge only 1.6 m long . None of the salesmen seem to know anything about microinverters and try asking the material from which the cells are made , the responses are amusing at best . <p> I have one question . An installer has quoted me for installation of sixteen panels in two strings . He carefully detailed the cost of panels and other components and even showed his -1000 fitting charge separately . I can not resolve , therefore the difference between replacing an inverter which you quote at around -1000 and his price for the inverter of -2700 . Can you suggest reasons why this price should be so high ? <p> Hi , can someone take the government minister in charge and tell him to force the electric companies to allow their new Smart Meters to run backwards ( technically possible ) so that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is then credited with all the electricity he generates in the day/summer and can use it for heating in the night/winter ( this is standard practice in the USA ) that would make solar pabels REALLY useful and annoy the electirc companies no end ! <p> Me and my husband currently reside in Italy . We thought it was the perfect place to retire . To the point , we have 3 properties in the UK , which we currently rent out . 2 of those are post-1980s cavity wall installed and one is a Victorian house that was recently brought up to energy efficient standards . The EPCs on all 3 properties recommend both solar pv and solar thermal systems , so should we be installing these systems to bring up the energy score . Both me and my husband are quite green keen ! Any help would be much appreciated . <p> Hi Harriet , I would always recommend going solar PV rather than solar thermal . The reason being is that when you are producing an excess of electricity from the solar panels ( i.e. demand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) you can use a solar diverter to send this excess electricity to the immersion unit on your hot water tank the result is free hot water too ! I think the solar thermal is very expensive for what it is and you would also need a different type of hot water tank ( with multiple inlets for different hot water sources ( e.g. immersion , gas boiler , solar thermal etc ) . The solar PV + solar diverter is a much simpler way to go ! <p> We have been quoted 9950 for a 3kw Trina 12 panel inverter system of PV panels . Roofs not due south facing but yield quoted below your estimates so no salesmans over generous claims hopefully ? ! Costs on your site are less for panels and installation by quite a lot . Does the quality of Trina panels justify the extra cost in your opinion ? <p> Hi Julia , That seems like a huge amount I would seek other quotes to be honest . <p> The systems should all come with a 20 year + warranty except for maybe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that length warranty too ) , so you shouldnt be too nervous about the quality of systems today . Obviously there are better and less good panels , but for a 3kW system you should be paying just over -5k . <p> This very interesting article hints that the efficiency of the panels affects the payback . This is obviousexcept that I do not know what a 4kw system ( highest domestic system ) then really means.it obviously can not relate to real output . My ( obviously misguided ) impression was that the 4kw was output so if you decided to use a less efficient panel type you just needed more of them to get to 4kw . <p> This is obviously wrong , but can you tell me what the 4kw is based on ? <p> A thoroughly interesting article , do you think that people would be more inclined to buy solar panels and have them installed if they understood the definitions of The Feed In Tariff properly and other schemes like this , maybe if they understood they could save money on Energy Bills they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Redzep a lot of people are not aware that under the feed-in tariff , they are paid to produce electricity not just if they sell it back to the grid . <p> We have tried to simplify the feed in tariff and explain the different components , but actually the easiest way is to sit down with the individual and talk the numbers through . Normally when we do this , the scepticism about financial returns from installing solar PV quickly evaporates . <p> Hi Leo , thanks for your comment micro inverters allow you to maximise the amount of solar energy you can harvest . In traditional solar systems with one inverter , they treat the whole solar system as one giant solar panel , so if one solar panel has reduced output for whatever reason ( e.g. shading ) , all the other panels will also operate at this lower output . Micro inverters allow each panel to operate individually . <p> Another advantage is that they tend to last far longer since the voltages flowing through them is far smaller . <p> To be honest , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except in circumstances where the panels will never suffer from shading and are all in exactly the same orientation . <p> I am considering getting solar panels , my roof is south facing and my house is about 6 meters long ( mid terrace ) could you tell my how many panels i might be able to squeeze on and how much it would cost roughly ? <p> Hi Deidre , thanks for your comment . This depends on the distance from the bottom of the roof upto the ridge . If this is 4m you could get 3 rows of panels fairly comfortably so you are looking at 18 panels . If you can only fit two rows of solar panels you are looking at 12 panels . I suggest getting a survey and then you will get an accurate view the surveyor should also be able to estimate the amount of electricity you can expect to produce once the panels are installed . 
@@36748808 @5748808/ <h> Are off-Grid battery systems worth it ? <h> December 11 , 2015 <p> With the impending government review into feed-in tariffs ( FiTs ) , in January 2016 , grid tied microgeneration systems will see an 85% cut in the generation rates paid out and the model that previously saw consumers see a decent pay-back in a relatively short space of time on these systems will disappear in its current format . The question is whether a new model that is based on an off-grid or a partial storage system can take its place and still be viable for the end consumer ? <h> What is a grid-tied microgeneration system ? <p> The most common microgeneration systems found in the UK are the ones that are installed with a connection to the Grid . This means that when the system is producing more electricity than is being consumed in the home or office , the excess electricity goes back into the national grid so it can then be <p> A grid tied system is also good when the system is not producing enough electricity or not producing anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy . In this case the grid tied property would simply import the electricity from the grid , but not as much if the microgeneration system is also generating electricity simultaneously . <h> What is an off-grid system ? <p> An off-grid system usually refers to systems that have storage capacity , which enables them to store electricity when it is being produced and the demand for the usage on site is low . These storage systems are also referred to as Energy Storage Systems or ESS . <p> For example , in a typical home that has a solar PV system , during the day when the users are at work or out and about electricity would be generated during the daylight hours . They would divert this electricity typically to a lithium-ion battery , which would then store this ready for when the appliances or energy emitting devices are needed . <p> Renewable systems have intermittency problems , which mean that they always produce enough electricity to enable the users to be fully self-sufficient from the grid . Solar PV systems on the other hand only produce electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 20% efficient . This means that even if you had a battery system ESS that was trickle charged during the day , even if the battery had enough capacity , it would n't be enough to fully satisfy the demand when you need the energy at night . <p> Therefore when we talk about off-grid ' systems in the UK we are probably referring to the fact that they have some sort of storage component but not necessarily fully self-sufficient from the grid to meet all the domestic or business demand . <h> How does an off-grid system work ( in theory ) ? <p> If you have solar PV installed with a battery pack ESS for electricity storage then the principle is pretty simple . During the daylight hours the system generates electricity and trickle charges the battery . In a typical home the amount of electricity generated is usually in excess of what is used by background appliances , which enables your battery to charge so that in the evening when you return from work , you have back-up power to run your appliances . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have a wind turbine system wired to the electrical circuits with the back-up batteries . At night when it tends to be windier , it will drive the propulsion on the turbines , which should generate the electrical charge . So when the business is shut down for operations overnight , the battery should be trickle charged ready for normal operations in the morning . <p> A solar PV system does not really work in typical 9-5 business because the electricity is used throughout the day and therefore it would n't make much sense installing a battery power back to store the energy . <h> What types of off-grid ' systems are currently available ? <p> The most typical ESS on the market are of the battery storage system format . These systems are currently being sold to domestic or commercial users are based on the lithium-ion battery . They come in different sizes starting typically at 3/4kW and going right up to MW power for larger commercial properties and utilities . <p> Sodium-ion battery technology appears to be a more sustainable and robust solution but these batteries are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hydrogen fuel cell technology can also be used for temporary energy storage or to level off peak demand for users . These systems are quite common for large commercial premises or utilities looking to balance peak electricity demand . <h> How much does an off-grid system cost in today 's prices ? <p> You can purchase a starter battery system ( manufactured by Samsung ) , which includes the battery , its inverter and the monitoring system for -6,000 . Combining a 4kWp solar PV system installation with a typical battery system will start at about -12--14k . Obviously with bigger systems installed you are looking at larger installation values . <p> Companies like Tesla , Google and Apple are looking to push the boundaries of these technologies and making sure that the final consumer gets a fair price . This is why when Tesla launched the Powerwall ' it is looking to market their lithium-ion battery for $3,500 for the US consumers , and we may well see similar prices in the UK when it is launched here . <h> Is an off-grid system worth it ? <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved that it is probably not worth installing this technology just yet . For -6,000 investment for essentially a system that is providing you less than 4kW of power it 's not really worth it , and it would be hard to see this money paying back anytime soon . <p> Not most lithium-ion batteries are limited to a certain number of charge cycles " the components that are housed in the battery wear down over time and become less efficient . Therefore these systems wo n't last a life time and you would have to certainly look to replace a current model within 10 years . <p> Installing Battery Storage <p> Interested in having a battery storage system installed in your home ?

This air is heated over a gas fuelled flame , which is then circulated around the property via a system of ducts . This type of heating is particularly effective in well insulated properties , and in single storey properties like flats and bungalows , but can also be found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly with a flame is very efficient and will rival a gas boiler in terms of efficiency , whilst ducting the air around the home is also very effective , and can heat a room very quickly , as well as help prevent damp and condensation build up around the home . <h> Why has warm air heating decreased in popularity ? <p> There are a couple of key reasons why warm air heating has diminished . Firstly , warm air cornered the market for smaller properties where boiler technology had not quite worked out an efficient way to fire a small 9kW boiler for example . Nowadays , boiler technology has solved many of these problems , and efficiency has improved markedly , making them more suitable for these types of home . <p> Secondly , warm air technology has not really kept up with these changes , with few of the big manufacturers showing interest in the technology , largely because the market is small , and there is little demand to retrofit ducts into an existing building . <h> So what are the disadvantages of ducted warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunately , that have prevented large scale take up of the system . These include : <p> Lack of water heating " Some of these- air heating systems can not heat their hot water with the same system , which means they have to choose between a separate gas boiler for hot water , or using an immersion heater . Both of these options are fairly inefficient , so any gains from the warm air system are going to be somewhat offset by the water heating issue . <p> Retrofit tricky " If you have a warm air system installed as part of the initial design of the building , then great , but trying to retrofit ducts into the property is going to be really tricky , and you will probably end up with visible ducts all over the house . <p> Cost and lack of installers " There are only a handful of models and installation companies on the market , so prices are not as competitive as boilers and choice is more limited . <p> Moving air can aggravate allergies " As you may have seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air round the room can really aggravate allergies , because they move dust into the air very easily . Radiators do this to an extent because of the convective action of the heat they generate , but warm air systems actively move the air around the room as part of their operation , so they can be really bad news for allergy sufferers . <h> When is warm air heating worth it ? <p> Warm air heating is not a bad option for some properties . Usually in a small property which is still under construction , allowing the ducting to be in-built . In a modern well insulated property which is able to in build a warm air system , there is definitely a place for this kind of heating . The problem is that there are not enough advantages over a traditional boiler to make the effort worthwhile . <h> 4 comments <p> My house is of the 1960s and already is fully ducted .

Infrared light is the reason we feel warm in the sun , even when the air temperature is low . Infrared waves travel through space and warm any objects they hit , including your body . <p> Convection , on the other hand ( i.e from- radiators ) , works by heating the air around you .

This would not only provide heat and- hot water , but in doing so , it would also ease the pressure on landfill capacity . <h> How does a biomass boiler work ? <p> A biomass boiler works in a very similar way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is then used to heat water . Biomass boilers are normally substantially bigger than their fossil fuel-burning brothers though , for a number of reasons . Firstly since they are burning wood pellets as opposed to gas , the boiler needs to be larger to hold the larger volume of fuel . <p> In addition , you may wish to install an automatic feed hopper on your biomass boiler , which will require additional room . This hopper stores a large volume of the wood pellets that are then automatically fed into the boiler as required , meaning that the boiler needs to be refuelled very infrequently . <p> It is also a good idea to have a store of the wood pellets at your property so you can keep producing heat if for some reason there is an issue with your fuel supplier . Ideally this should be close to where the fuel is delivered to your home , to minimise the distance you have to carry it . <p> Biomass boiler wooden pellets <p> Most residential biomass boilers can also run on logs as well as the wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you can source them cheaply or even for free , it will dramatically reduce the operational running cost of your biomass boiler . <p> Every four weeks or so , the biomass boiler will need to be emptied of the ash .

They can be coupled with- solar heating- or an electric shower , providing you with your hot water for washing only , during the warmer summer months . <h> How does biomass measure up against traditional fuels ? <p> Biomass boilers measure up very favourably in terms of running costs vs. natural gas , heating oil and especially electricity .

These wood burning stoves can be fitted with a back boiler that uses the heat produced when the wood is combusted to heat water , that can then be used for either space heating elsewhere in the home or for hot water only . <p> Both standalone wood burning stoves and biomass boilers will need a vent , designed specifically for wood fuel appliances , with sufficient air movement for proper operation of the stove .

This means that some models will eventually be paid for fully by RHI payments , but many especially top-end models will not be covered completely .

That means that an inefficient care home will leak a lot of money and energy efficiency olidhould be high on the priority list ! <h> What are the key areas for improvement ? <p> Insulation is obviously important in a property with high heat demand . The walls can be insulated with cavity wall or solid wall insulation , and the loft or flat roof can be insulated as well . <p> One key area is to look at the heating system . There is likely to be a large boiler servicing the property , and this could well be decades old . If so , upgrading to a condensing model should certainly be looked at , as the savings are going to be considerable . <h> What funding is available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal form of funding " ECO " is only available for properties that qualify as residential . Sheltered accommodation will probably qualify for this as each resident has their own defined unit with a bathroom , kitchen and bedroom , and often have their own electric meter . If this is the case , and an EPC can be done on each unit , then ECO funding should be available . <p> For care homes that do n't generally have their own self contained apartments and tend to just have a room with a communal social area and central kitchen , the property is effectively a commercial building , and as such , they wo n't qualify for ECO funding . <p> A commercial energy efficiency scheme- could potentially become available in the future in the form of loans to business for energy efficiency improvements , but at the moment there are no comprehensive- mechanisms available . Unfortunately with the cancellation of the- domestic Green Deal energy saving scheme , another model would have to be put in place that could prove credible- for businesses to embrace . <h> Renewables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these sorts of properties is solar PV or thermal .

@@36748816 @5748816/ <h> Heating your home without mains gas <h> September 24 , 2013 <h> The traditional Off-Gas options <p> For the 15% of people in the UK that are not connected to the gas grid , heating the home can be expensive and options limited . Usually these are older properties with poor efficiency and many use expensive forms of heating , like bulk LPG or heating oil , which can make the cost of heating the home twice that of someone with a mains gas supply . With a growing range of options now available for off-grid homes , you really should take a look at your options if you currently spend too much on your fuel bills . In the following blog I want to show you the options available to you . <h> New LPG or heating oil boilers <p> Switching from an old , inefficient LPG or oil boiler to a modern condensing one will offer you similar savings to a standard on-grid boiler , so it is certainly worth considering if your boiler is getting old . The higher cost of LPG and oil over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are likely to be cheaper options for your home ; we recommend you look at other heating options before opting for a straight switch . <h> Wood burning stoves and coal fires <p> It is perhaps surprising to some how many people still heat their home with wood or smokeless coal . In fact , using a wood burning stove can be a cheap and effective means of heating a home , but it does come with impracticalities . The home tends to be unevenly heated , and in the case of larger properties , some rooms may need additional electric or Calor gas heating , and the hot water will require another heating system " such as an immersion tank . We thoroughly recommend looking at biomass boilers , which can utilise the same fuel to evenly heat your home via a central heating system and heat your water . <h> Electric options <p> There are several methods of heating your home with electricity , but do bear in mind that electricity is currently about 3-4 times the price of heating your home with gas . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more information on any of them please click on the titles and you will be taken to the individual technology pages . <p> If you ca n't use gas and ca n't install a heat pump or biomass boiler for whatever reason , then infrared heating panels are the cheapest way of heating your home . Unlike conventional heating that takes advantage of convection heating to warm the air in the home , infrared radiation travels unimpeded from the infrared heating panel until it hits a solid object where it gets absorbed " warming that solid object up . Infrared radiation is the reason you feel warm when the sun is shinning even in the middle of the winter . For this reason , infrared heating is a much more effective way of warming a space rather than using conventional convection heating ( if you have no access to mains gas ) . <p> We have discussed infrared heating in more detail here and we also stock various infrared-heating panels here . <h> Electric Boilers <p> Electric boilers work by heating the water in a tank with an element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but because the cost of electricity is around three times the price of gas , they tend to be much more expensive than equivalent gas boilers . However if you can install these along with solar PV ( where you will produce free electricity from the sun ) , they are a solution worth considering . <p> You can look at our more detailed page on storage heaters here . Modern storage heaters tend to be a more cost effective means of heating than an electric boiler , because of the cheaper night rate electricity that these heaters utilise . Plus they are much cheaper to install and maintain compared to gas central heating . On the downside , they do not allow the same level of control over your heating when compared to a central heating system and they will still suffer with spiralling energy prices . <h> Renewable options <p> With the renewable heat incentive for off grid heat pumps and biomass boilers , and energy prices sky high , it is a great time to think about renewable energy for your property . You can read up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very reliable means of self generation . Utilising heat differentials which exist all year round , they offer an excellent option for off-grid homes . Although the initial cost of installation is high , when combined with the heat incentive payments and spiralling energy costs , they begin to look a lot more attractive . You will need to make a considerable upfront payment however , so they are n't for everyone . <p> Biomass boilers , although initially a little pricey , really do pay back and then some , with the RHI . Based on the heat demand ' on your Energy Performance Certificate , some homes could see very favourable returns over the seven year payment period . I carried out a Green Deal assessment a couple of weeks ago and the home will make -7,000 per year for 7 years based on installing a biomass boiler the biomass boiler needed though would cost -20,000 to install , however the returns could well justify the initial expenditure . <p> Although Solar thermal does not have to be installed off grid to qualify for the RHI , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it can be used to heat your hot water , reducing the strain on your wallet when the energy bill turns up at the door . As with any renewable , you are likely going to have to pay money up front and see returns over the seven years of the RHI . <p> Solar PV produces electricity directly from sunlight " therefore by itself it is n't going to be able to heat your home , however used in conjunction with either infrared heating panels , electric boilers , storage heaters or air source heat pumps , the free electricity you produce will obviously mean that heating your home with electricity suddenly becomes affordable . You will also benefit from the Feed-in tariff , which will pay you for every kWh of electricity you produce ( currently -0.1292 / kWh ) . <h> What 's right for my home ? <p> So there are plenty of options available to you even if you are not connected to the gas grid .

With the backside roof facing due South , would buying/building a new home as all electric consumption with a grid tied solar panel system and no gas piping/hookup . It seems not paying for any gas hook-up/piping would be a good offset to help with the solar cost .

Are there things which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solar installer ( conduit , breakers , panels , etc ) ? <p> Hi Richard , If initial capital is no object go for a ground source heat pump ( will cost about 20k ) provided this is installed by a MCS installer you will recover much of the money through the renewable heat incentive scheme . A ground source heat pump produces hot water through electricity in a ratio of approximately 4 or 5 units of useful heat for every one unit of electricity ( a traditional electric heater is 1 to 1 ) . You can supplement this through solar panels that will provide much of the electricity to power the heat pump provided you have a south ( ish ) facing roof . The more panels you can fit on the roof the better . <p> Hi , I have a property rented out just on the outskirts of Hereford , our oil boiler is now 12 years old and breaking down more and more often and bring rather expensive bills .

I am now considering all my options but finding any information on alternatives proving difficult .. Can any body help <p> Hi Sam , that seems rather expensive ( -4500 ) to install a new like for like oil boiler . Are they able to keep the boiler in the same location ? And I assume you are keeping the hot water tank as is rather than moving to a pressurised system ( making a few assumptions here ! ) . I would firstly get more quotes , as it is likely you will be able to find something more competitive . Remember that anyone you use needs to be gas safe , and ideally go with a recommendation ! . <p> In terms of renewable heating systems like heat pumps , biomass boilers and so forth , they all have their merits , but they do tend to be expensive . An air source heat pump will cost approximately 9k to install . A ground source nearer 20k . A biomass will cost about 10-12k .

If you want more information on any of these techs just have a look through this site ( we have a widget on the top right of this page ) and you can learn all about them and whether or not they would be right for you . <p> Hi Kay , we hear very mixed things on Fisher heating . They are storage heaters , so charge and then release the heat as required which certainly is n't for everyone ! I think the thing we hear most about them is the price though the quotes that people are getting are ridiculous to be honest . I have n't seen them in the flesh though , but they seem to have got their marketing spot on because a lot of people have heard about them ! We will maybe get one in the office to try and then we can give a bit more useful feedback ! <p> Plain old air source heat pumps ( ASHPs ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my northern US climate ( Cleveland ) . Since ASHPs are 200-500% efficient , they overcome the cost difference with natural gas in many instances . If gas is not an option they are by far the best one , and I am even switching clients off gas to heat pumps . <p> The other big benefit of electric options is that you can make your own with solar panels or windmills . At that point you have limited your utility cost for the 30 life of panels or windmill . My 2 cents/pence . <p> Hi Nate , Thanks for your comment . I agree with what you are saying , although if funds allow we would always go for a ground source heat pump over an air source , mainly because the efficiency stays consistent throughout the year . When the temperature invariably falls over the winter months in the UK an air source heat pump will be less efficient , because the ambient temperature of the air is cooler so the compressor needs to work harder to drive the temperature of the water up . Conversely with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all year round so the efficiency that the heat pump works at will be maintained even on the coldest of days . <p> In the UK , you also benefit from the renewable heat incentive which pays the owner of such a system for every unit of hot water produced . In most cases this covers the cost of install ( although it is paid over 7 years , so you would need the initial investment capital ) . <p> I 've heard mixed reviews of ground source heat pumps in UK though interested myself . Is it a viable alternative for the ordinary 3-bed terrace house ? Have you got evidence that it has a good track record of delivering against projections ? <p> Hi John , It is certainly viable , but you will be paying a lot for it , so that is the first thing to consider . The Government RHI payments are all based on the deemed heat usage on the bottom of the EPC , so the first thing to do is calculate your estimated RHI return . Use a COP of 4 in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In terms of delivery against projections , the key difference between the ground source heat pumps and the air source heat pumps ( aside from price ) are the COP for the GSHP is consistent over the course of the year because the temperature under the ground does n't  really vary , while for the ASHP the COP varies hugely over the year because air temperature fluctuates so much . The COP of an ASHP during winter might be less than 1.5 , but a GSHP should be in excess of 4 even during the coldest days , therefore the projections for ground source heat pumps tend to be more accurate and as such we are pretty confident suggesting them . <p> We have a wood-burning stove with water cylinder that heats hot water 7 radiators . Most of our wood comes from building sites where it would be burnt as waste and costs us nothing other than a little time and fuel to collect and cut . Biomass costs , has bigger delivery impact and can displace food production . Why would I change ?

During growth the hemp crop will sequester ( lock up ) about two tonnes of carbon dioxide per tonne of fibre harvested , which it uses for growth .

@@36748819 @5748819/ <h> Cavity Wall Insulation <h> Insulation <h> Why get cavity wall insulation ? <p> A home can lose as much as 35% of its heat through uninsulated external walls . By investing in cavity wall insulation , you can significantly reduce the heat loss from your home . The concept of insulating a cavity wall is really very simple " it involves filling the cavity between the two skins of masonry- bricks with an insulating material , which slows the movement of heat through the wall . Maintaining the heat inside your home keeps you warm and cosy when you need to be . It also works in reverse by keeping your house cooler in the summer months . <p> Installing cavity wall insulation in your home will not only help to decrease your heating bills by saving energy lost through the walls , it will also help to reduce your carbon footprint by limiting the amount of CO- and other greenhouse gases emitted from your property . <p> Many houses since the late 1930s were built with a cavity between the inner and outer walls . Because- of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performances which are well below the standards required by current building regulations . These properties suffer from unacceptably high levels of heat and energy loss through the walls . A system was introduced in the 1970s to inject insulation into these cavity walls . <h> Can I get cavity wall insulation ? <p> There are two things you need to determine to see whether you can benefit from retrofitting cavity wall insulation in your home . <p> The first thing is to work out if you actually have cavity walls this might seem stupid , but you can not inject insulation if there is n't a cavity and they do look quite similar to solid walls ! <p> A cavity wall is made up of two- masonry- brick- walls running parallel to one another with a space ( cavity ) between them of at least 50mm . Masonry- bricks are very- absorbent , so moisture absorbed by the outer wall typically- drains through the cavity , rather than coming into the home , helping to prevent damp issues . This type of wall construction became the norm in the 1930s superseding- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of the cavity between the two skins of brick has continued to grow a typical cavity wall now is between 280-300mm thick . <p> You can easily identify a cavity wall by the pattern produced by the brickwork , which is known as stretcher bond , where are the bricks are running in the same direction as one another there are no half bricks . This is obviously harder to do if your walls are cladded or painted and in this case you might need to call in a professional ( although sometimes you can see original brickwork in the loft space ) . In addition cavity walls tend to be over 250mm in width , with more recent cavity walls closer to 300mm . If you can see lots of half bricks in your wall , you have a solid wall with no cavity , so unfortunately cavity wall insulation is a no-go . In this case , you could look into- external wall insulation as an alternative . <p> Once you have established that you have cavity walls , you need to determine the size of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered installer will need to come and carry out a boroscope inspection . This involves drilling a test hole into the wall and checking with a camera to see if the cavity has previously been filled and the size of the cavity ( ideally over 50mm ) . If this shows the cavity is unfilled , you could indeed benefit from cavity wall insulation . <p> Although some builders began insulating cavity walls in the late 1970s , it only became compulsory under building regulations to do so during the 90s . As such there are many properties in the UK that currently have unfilled cavity walls . The good news it that these can be insulated very easily ! <h> How does cavity wall insulation work ? <p> If a hot room is partitioned from the cold by a wall , heat will move through the wall , eventually cooling the room until an equilibrium is reached , where the outside temperature is equal to the inside temperature . In reality this very rarely happens , because rooms tend to be heated . This means that as some heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keeping it at a comfortable ambient temperature . If the thermal gradient is larger , ( e.g.- on a cold and wintry day ) , the movement of thermal energy across the wall will be accelerated . <p> Insulating a cavity- wall helps to provide a thermal- barrier , which slows the flow of heat out of a room considerably . By slowing down the rate at which heat escapes from the home , less heating is needed to keep the house at the required temperature . In the summer , the reverse happens ; hot air outside the home ca n't get in as easily , which means you do n't  need to use energy to keep the home cool . Therefore in both summer and winter , cavity wall insulation can make an enormous difference to your energy bills . The process is relatively quick and inexpensive , so it is- certainly- worth considering . <h> How do you insulate cavity walls ? <p> The first thing to note is that you can not retrofit cavity wall insulation as a do-it-yourself job it is a job that needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cavity has been confirmed by the boroscopic inspection , the installer will drill a series of 22mm diameter holes into the mortar between the bricks . With specialist equipment , the installer will then inject the cavity with the insulating material , through each of these holes . Once the whole of the cavity wall has been filled , the mortar will be made good either with plugs or mortar created to match the existing colour , so the job will be barely noticeable . <p> The insulating material pumped into the cavity is normally a type of glass wool , or in some instances insulating beads and once installed will offer insulation for the life of the building . The whole process should only take about 2 hours but obviously if the cavity wall area is especially large you will need to leave more time for the job to be completed . <h> What materials are used for cavity wall insulation ? <p> Expanded polystyrene ( EPS ) foam , loose polystyrene beads , or wool . EPS is the most expensive option for a reason ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extra money for the best results . <h> Savings from cavity wall insulation <p> Although the savings from cavity wall insulation vary greatly from property to property , for an average size three bedroom home , the energy savings from installing cavity wall insulation should amount to -250 per year . With an installation cost of -600-1000 , the savings you create from installing the cavity wall insulation should pay for the work in under 4 years . <h> Can I get free cavity wall insulation ? <p> Free cavity wall insulation is now available throughout England , thanks to our partners at- BillSave UK . If you receive one of the following benefits , you could be eligible for a grant as part of the Governments- ECO scheme . <h> Paying for cavity wall insulation yourself <p> Unfortunately schemes like the Green Deal have now finished , but there is still some ECO funding for cavity wall insulation . The amount of funding depends on the heat demand of the property and the savings that will be generated from installing the insulation .

It is likely if you property was installed with cavity wall insulation in the last 2 years , white wool was injected into the cavity ( if it was done under a Government scheme ) . To be honest with any type of cavity wall insulation you are safe it would be very very unlikely to accelerate a fire since the insulation is contained within 2 skins of brick . If it is wool specifically the risk is even smaller as most wool are classed Class A1 in terms of their fire risk and A1 is essentially non combustable . <p> I was offered free cavity wall insulation by a door to door sales guy last year . After several surveys and a whole lot of calls back and forth I never got anything done . I think if you want something like this done you need to pay for it . Grants seem to attract the wrong type of companies in my humble opinion . <p> Anyway I paid for it and got it installed this winter by a bead insulation company . They got it done within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grand . Its a big detached house so I thought that was pretty reasonable . No problems as yet and I don ; t expect there to be any . Do n't  get these free insulation cowboys out dig into your wallet and get the pros in ! <p> Hi Jim , while I agree with you that workmanship is everything , there are companies out there that work with Government schemes like ECO that offer a quality installation . I think , negative newspaper headlines from the Daily Mail and the Express with respect to the cavity wall insulation schemes do not help . So , many in the public are turned off by problem stories surfacing as a result of poor workmanship , but then those same newspapers do not devote any time to actually cover the positive aspects of insulating your property . <p> I am sorry that you could n't benefit from any grant funding for the cavity wall insulation , but pleased you managed to get the cavity walls insulated and are benefiting from reduced energy bills this year ! Just out of interest did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the installation as well ? <p> Nick , Thanks for your reply . Perhaps there are some exaggerated stories out there , but I think my experience shows that there is no smoke without fire . I hope that the government put some better controls in place to make sure these installers do a good job and do n't  waste time with surveys that go no where that would be my advice . <p> I think I got a warranty on my job , I will have to try and dig it out . Is this something they are supposed to provide ? I 've never really been one for warranties mind . You can pay hundreds of pounds for a piece of paper don ; t tell me these companies turn up 10 years down the line when my walls get wet ! That 's why I went for beads get the job done right the first time , that 's what I always say . <p> The polystyrene beads are a great insulant for the cavity walls and given you have gone for this option , I do n't  think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retention properties . However , I would go an cite a couple of reasons , why a private contractor with no certification may lead to problems vs. an installer that has been certified with a known competency scheme and would usually be listed on a Government approved website. 1 . The Government approved and certified contractor would have to jump through a serious of hoops , and as mentioned would be certified externally for competence . Whereas the private contractor is unregulated. 2 . Any funded jobs now via ECO or a Government backed subsidy scheme have to be surveyed and logged in a central database to prove they are suitable for the measure . 3 . By installing as part of a Government funding scheme you are obliged to provide an external warranty , such as CIGA or GDGC , so if something went wrong with the installation , you would have the first steps available to claim on the install to have it re-mediated . <p> On the otherhand , you may well have had a very competent installer , and it is very difficult to judge standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just ask what is the finish of your existing walls ? Do you have brick or existing render ? <p> I live in a bungalow in Oxford . I had cavity wall insulation installed in the walls of my home 22 years ago and I am wondering whether it is worth replacing ? I am assuming the type of insulation is now better than what has previously been available and the home will be kept even warmer . Is this the case ? Also we have noticed that our dining room is slightly cooler now during the winter months , can cavity wall insulation slip within the cavity . I do n't  suppose it can as I guess it would have no where to go , but it would be useful to find out . Also we are now on pension credit , is there a grant available for the cavity wall insulation if we do end up getting it replaced ? <p> Hi Arthur , In truth the insulation materials have n't really changed in terms of thermal performance . You might get marginally better performance from modern insulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you had your home done 22 years ago , it was done with Urea Formaldehyde this does break down over time and can slip down the cavity . It can be removed and replaced with new cavity wall insulation , but the issue is that it will be expensive to remove and there is no funding for that ( you are looking at between -15 -25 per m2 to get this done depending where in the country you are looking to get this done and accessibility issues ) . In terms of replacing with new insulation , there should be some funding available once the cavity has been cleared , but how much will depend on the funder / installer in your area . <p> We are interested in getting cavity wall insulation in our block of flats . Is there a grant to help cover the cost of this ? We know the neighbouring block have had it done , but I went outside the property and could n't see the little holes in the wall that I could see on the other block . It also gets extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulation . Will companies charge for an inspection to determine whether we can get this done . <p> Hi Mary , There is a grant currently available called ECO . If you head over to our installer map , most ( sadly not all ) have access to this grant so put in your postcode to find your closest installer and then give them a call ! Click here to head to our map ! <p> Hi Jonathan , this depends on the thickness of the cavity ( as this limits the amount of insulation that can be used ) . If you are insulating externally , you tend to use a minimum of 90mm of EPS ( expanded polystyrene ) . This will take the u-value of the solid wall down to 0.3 which on a retrofit would confirm with building regs . Over the years the cavity on cavity walls has been made thicker and thicker since its function moved from just preventing water ingress to doing that as well as housing insulation , but older cavities tend to be anywhere from 40mm 60mm . If you insulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve a u-value of 0.45 . Basically solid wall insulation is better in terms of energy saving , because the amount of insulation you can add is unlimited . The issue is that solid wall insulation is far more expensive than cavity wall insulation . <p> I have a question regarding cavity wall insulation . We have been offered two types of free cavity wall insulation for our 1970s mid terrace property . The first is a bead , and the other is wool , both of which are injected . My question is pretty simple really , which one should I go for ! Since they are both free it does n't make much difference for me , but I guess like with all things there are good and bad products . I have read some horror stories about cavity wall ; insulation , but my neighbours on either side have both had it done so I am happy that we are not in an area where the insulation would pose a risk on my home . <p> I guess since the insulation is hidden there are two things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings . I want to maximise these cause why not ! Secondly , I want to minimise the risks associated with cavity wall insulation which as far as I can see is damp . So which will save me more and which is better at stopping damp crossing the cavity ? Hopefully the answer to both of these questions is the same material ! ! <p> I am interested in getting cavity wall insulation installed on my 1980s semi detached house . The house is generally cold so I am looking for a cost effective way of improving this situation ! I have been trying to research cavity wall insulation online , but specifically I am trying to find out which of the insulation products is the best to get installed in the cavity , From what I have read I have 3 options , foam , wool or EPS beads . Please can you let me know which is the best product to go for in terms of stopping damp entering but also providing the best level of insulation in the house . Would appreciate any help ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest , you will pay slightly more than you would for wool , but it produces a waterproof barrier within the cavity , so water can not travel through it which means there is no danger of getting damp in the home . In addition this type of insulation has higher insulating properties than wool so therefore in our opinion it is the winner ! <p> We have had an assessment on our walls and been told we have a very thin cavity , so I am wondering whether it is worth / possible to insulate this ? The assessor predicted it was under 45mm , so I am not sure what the potential energy savings would be but also I am aware that cavity wall insulation in some cases can cause damp , although we are located in near Reading and from what I have heard damp often happens in areas of high exposure . If we did end up insulating the cavity what is the product that offers the best thermal performance . <p> Hi Jimmy , my thoughts are that yes regardless of the depth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of cavity wall insulation failure rate , the numbers are actually pretty small and as you correctly point out , the failures tend to be far more concentrated in high exposure areas . For narrow cavities we would recommend going for the EPS beads ( bonded ) , as these offer really good thermal insulation ( for the thickness ) compared to wool insulation products . It also creates a barrier , preventing water cross from the outer skin to the inner skin of brick so I would recommend looking to that as your best bet . <p> Hello , i have recently bough a timber frame house , in newcastle as is around 35 years old , however when i bought the property they had removed the cavity insulation because they had to certoficates , should i be looking at getting it reinstalled ? I understand that a dofferent type of jInsulatoon is required for this build type . Also if i have jt done would i Also be fIlling my Neigblurs walls ? ( Mid terrace ) thanks <p> Hi Phillip , there are currently no cavity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need to remove it from your property ) . We have heard there is going to be a material released soon that is suitable but this is still going through final testing , but hopefully it will be released at some point during 2017 . <p> Hi , they normally will put down cavity brushes into the cavity where there is a risk of the insulation flowing down into adjacent properties . This ensures the cavity wall insulation stays exactly where required . <p> Hi , I was wondering if you could provide me with some assistance . We had someone knock on the door offering free cavity wall insulation . It is not something I had considered previously , but since it is free I thought I would do some research . Having looked online , cavity wall insulation has very mixed reviews , my house is cold during the winter months so I think it could do with the additional insulation however I do n't want it to lead to any damp issues . I live in Leicester ( about the most famous place on the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no reported driving rain and the property was built in 1970 so I am guessing the cavity walls are a reasonable thickness , my understanding is that over time the cavity has got thicker . So how do I know if my property is suitable ? It is semidetached and from I have asked my neighbours either side and one has had it done and one has refused so far . I assume the cavity wall insulation companies get paid to install it so could n't really give a damn about whether it is truly suitable or not but obviously it is my home so I want to make the correct decision . Any thoughts on whether I should get cavity wall insulation would be greatly appreciated ! <p> Hi Lisa , where abouts are you based ? Cavity wall insulation when installed correctly is a brilliant energy saving solution however there are cases where it is not worth installing cavity wall insulation and solid wall insulation should be installed instead ( on the cavity walls ) . Solid wall insulation prevents winter ingress , so if you live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Hi Susan , a very interesting comment and I would of thought a sentiment shared by many is cavity wall insulation safe to install on my home ? Well the answer really depends as the research you have carried out suggests . In many cases cavity wall insulation is incredibly effective energy saving measure again as you mentioned there are companies still offering this for free and the impact on energy bills can be huge . Having said that , it is n't suitable for every property when cavity wall properties were built originally ( to replace the older solid wall properties ) , the sole purpose of the cavity wall was to help prevent water crossing the wall into the home . As such , filling the cavity with insulation could make pathways across the cavity by which water can pass from the outer leaf to the inner leaf . Nowadays though the cavity definitely has two functions the first is to prevent water crossing the wall structure but also the cavity is used to house insulation . I think it comes down to a few simple things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( wool or blown beads ) . Secondly there are some places where cavity wall insulation just inst suitable . If you have a property at the top of a hill or on the West coast then cavity wall insulation should also be avoided because of the risk of driving rain . Also ( and this is the hardest to judge ) not all cavity wall installers are great at what they do . If the cavity is not filled correctly then it will lead to cold spots in the house , also there are companies that inject the cavities and fill flues and vents which obviously should not be filled . I would always try to get a recommendation ( so speak to previous customers that the cavity wall installer has used ) sorry to not be any more help ! <p> Sorry about putting this in as a plug , but as you have talked about PAYING for wall cavity insulation I thought I should point out you can have this installation for free . ECO Contracting Services will do the technical survey and installation for free under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team , we send technical surveyors to the property to do a EPC and talk to the customer about which insulation would be best suitable for the property ( this can include free loft insulation ) . <p> The air gap reduces heat losses from the walls by both conduction and convection : conduction , because heat cant conduct through gases ; convection , because there 's relatively little air between the walls and its sealed in , so convection currents cant really circulate . That makes cavity walls a bit more efficient that solid walls and therefore as such have a marginally smaller u-value . <p> In truth though , we need to try to stop heat escaping completely ( or at least slowing the rate at which equilibrium is met either side of the wall ) therefore by using a really good insulator ( mineral wool / PIR board ) then this is going to have a far bigger impact on heat loss than having unfilled cavities . <p> Hi . Just wondered if I could get some well needed advice . I have damaged cavities which are full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have recently paid to have rockwool removed and new wall ties . I have been told by a local energy company that external wall insulation would be next best option , at a cost of - 12-1500.

This was the same guy who told me I could replace rockwool removed with thermabeads until energy firm came out and said to the contrary . I am so confused and nedd to make a decision . I will have to borrow money for external wall insulation but do n't  mind as long as this is the right thing to do and will save me money on bills and keeep housr warm . Please help <p> I have a ground floor flat which is 28 years old . I suffer from mould in 1 corner of my bedroom and this room is extremely cold at times . I need to keep the heating at a constant temperature for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it keeps recurring between the fitted wardrobe and the outer wall , spreading under the drawers .

I have also been advised that a dividing brush can be fitted to separate any flat that does not want the work carried out . Also we live quite near the river mersey and when the weather is bad the rain can come in sideways ! What is the difference from Technitherm to Isotherm ? Would appreciate your help <p> hi , we live in an old railway house . the walls are about 21 inches thick , 4 bricks deep , but they do have a cavity between the exterior and interior walls . the house was built in 1908 but I have been informed that cavity wall insulation ca n't be installed as the house is too old for cavity wallsbasically they do n't  want to do the job . do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of male bovine manure ? <p> Hi Jon , as a rule of thumb installers are taught anything built prior to 1935 is solid wall construction while anything built after this is cavity wall it is for this reason that they do n't  view your walls as a true cavity . In a way they have a point as the cavity is likely to be filled with all sort of rubble which will hamper the cavity wall insulation process . It is for this reason that I would n't suggest going for cavity wall insulation as it might lead to damp issues down the line , however if you are going to go for it , I would ensure you go for the beads rather than the wool to help minimise the risks . <p> Quite possibly worth ringing the housing association and asking the question . Cavity wall insulation is one of the cheapest energy efficiency measures available and so the Government / councils are very keen to get this installed so you might be in luck ! <p> The point about driving rain is a good one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable for cavity wall insulation is incorrect it just means a more appropriate type of cavity wall insulation is required check out Technitherm from Isothane for this type of location and for flood risk areas . 
@@36748820 @5748820/ <h> Can I reseal my double glazing ? <h> September 30 , 2013 <h> What is double glazing ? <p> Double-glazed doors and windows are made up of two sealed sheets of glass with an insulating void between them . This gap is either in the form of a vacuum , or more commonly filled with a heavy inert gas such as argon . Together , the panes of glass and the void between them are very effective at preventing heat loss . In fact the U-value for a new double glazed window can be as low as 1.7 , while a single glazed window in comparison has a u-value closer to 5 . <p> However , over time the effectiveness of the double-glazing can wane , especially if the seal goes around one of the panes of glass , allowing air to replace either the vacuum or the inert gas between the panes . <p> The most common side effect of a seal going is that the window will fog up , as water vapour condenses on the inside surface of the window . If you notice your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to look through them , it means that the seals have started to fail . <h> Why have my double glazing seals become damaged ? <p> This can happen due to a number of reasons , however the most common tends to be general wear and tear as the double-glazing unit ages . Continuous changes in temperature cause fluctuations in the size of the glazed unit , since they expand- in warmth- and contract in the cold , and over time this can loosen and damage the seals . <p> Particularly strong cleaning products can also sometimes eat away at the seal , so even though we all like being able to see through really clean windows , - it is wise to make- sure the cleaning product you are using is not chemically abrasive . <p> Other reasons for your double-glazing unit failing include faulty installations or faulty production methods . However on the whole these should be covered by your window installer . It is therefore key to make sure you keep your FENSA certificate and a receipt of any work carried out . <p> As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double-glazing unit .

The good news is that even though the seals have gone , the thermal performance of the windows will not be that bad . To be honest , the double glazing is only worth replacing if the windows have condensation inside and you can no longer see through them . From an energy saving point of view it is not worth it . <p> Hi We have the same problem , with the rubber gaskets around several of our double glazed units having perished in bedrooms , to the point where there are quite bad draughts coming through these gaps .

Instead of taking advantage of the heat in the air or the ground , they take advantage of the relatively consistent temperatures found in a body of water . <p> A series of flexible pipework is submerged in a body of water , such as a lake , river or stream . A heat pump pushes working fluid through the network of piping , and this fluid absorbs the heat from the surrounding water as it goes . <p> This working fluid is then compressed by an electric compressor , in a similar fashion to the other types of heat pump , which raises the temperature .

We often hear the word radiation and automatically associate it with being harmful , but in fact , radiation is just a process of energy emission . Just like visible light radiation , infrared radiation is 100% safe and even our own bodies emit infrared radiation ( which is what allows search and rescue helicopters to find lost travellers at night for example ) . <h> Conventional space heating in homes <p> Conventional heating in the home works by warming up the air around you ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convection currents ( it also gives off small amounts of infrared radiation ) . <p> When the radiator warms up , it heats the air directly around it , which then expands and rises .

As the hot air begins to cool down it drops down back to floor level . This cold air gets heated again and this process keeps repeating itself " this is known as convection heating . <p> Most conventional heating systems do emit some infrared waves .

The object absorbs the radiation , causing molecules within it to vibrate , producing heat . <h> From -189.99 <p> If the- waves come into contact with humans , they will travel about an inch into the body providing a feeling of deep heat , but even if you are not directly in the way of the waves , any solid body will vibrate when the waves hit them , causing them to radiate heat back towards you . <p> Despite being able to purchase gas , oil and solid fuel infrared heaters , we suggest using electric infrared panels in the home , since you do not need to integrate any pipe work or fuel storage facilities when you install the panels . There are also no direct emissions associated with using the electrical panels ( and if you use them in conjunction with solar panels you get 100% emission free heating ) . They also can be placed high up on the walls or the ceiling , so they will be easy to keep away from pets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiator ) . <p> The electric panels come in numerous sizes and certain models- can double up as mirrors . Since they have no moving parts , they operate in complete silence , which makes them ideal for bedrooms . <h> Energy savings from infrared heaters <p> Infrared heating works by heating the surface area of a room , rather than the volume ( as is the case the traditional convection heaters ) , which means they are heating considerably less to provide the same amount of heat . <p> The following worked example compares a 600 Watt infrared heat panel and a standard 1500 Watt convection heater ( like for like providing the same comfort of heat ) , providing heat up to 4 months of winter ( November through to Feb ) for 8 hours a day at a cost of -0.14 per kWh of electricity . <p> Infrared Heater <p> Convection Heater <p> - Energy rating <p> 600 Watts <p> 1500 Watts <p> - Electricity units per hour <p> 0.60 <p> 1.50 <p> - Thermostat savings <p> 50% <p> 80% <p> - Total eletrical units used <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -161.28 <p> In addition , you are heating solid walls or objects with infrared radiation and these have a thermal mass , which means they retain heat and help keep the home cosy . Conversely , air has no thermal mass , so in the case of traditional convection-warmed rooms , when a door is opened , the hot air will quickly escape ; requiring you to reheat the room to feel warm again . One brilliant factor in favour of these panels is the ability to provide the home with a fully-zoned property . Unlike central heating systems , the panels can be switched on in individual rooms using the thermostats . This means that heating is only fully used when required . If you think how much energy is wasted in rooms that do not need to be heated , such as guest bedrooms , this is a real benefit . <p> Electric infrared panels also only take about 30 seconds to reach full operating temperature and therefore are much more efficient at heating a space than conventional space heating heaters . The heat is also contained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the heat . This means that it stays warmer for longer and draughts do not play as large a part when compared with convection heaters . <h> Other advantages of infrared heating <p> Another major advantage of infrared heating is that unlike conventional heaters that just heat the air , infrared heaters heat the walls , which will mean they stay completely dry . It then builds up the thermal mass within the walls and the floors , which maintains the warmth and keeps it dry by reducing condensation . Therefore infrared heating helps prevent the spread of mould in the property . <h> From -189.99 <p> In addition , conventional heaters warm the room by convection currents that circulate dust particles continuously around the home , however these convection currents do not occur with infrared heating , so for people who suffer from asthma , infrared panels can be the ideal solution . <p> Infrared heaters also will provide the optimum heating temperature within 30 seconds of being turned on . Since there are no moving parts , they make no noise ; therefore they are ideal as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units are compact and can be designed to provide another function such as a mirror in the bathroom , which helps save room . <p> Since infrared heaters heat solid objects in the home like walls , they prevent any moisture build up on these surfaces and so inhibit the spread of mould . <p> Fit and forget technology , very little maintenance required <p> These- heaters are emission free ( i.e. no fuel is burnt in their operation ) and if they are used in conjunction with renewable energy sources like solar PV , you are producing 100% clean heat . <p> The way these- heaters heat a room is more efficient than conventional convection heaters so they are more cost effective to run . <p> Infrared heaters warm solid objects with a thermal capacity , therefore if a room is draughty or a door is opened , the solid objects retain the heat keeping the room warm . 184564 @qwx384564 <p> They cost about twice as much as traditional convection space heaters . However the saving difference made should mean that they pay back in a little over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your energy bills . <p> To feel the true benefits of the heating panel , there needs to be no obstacles between you and the heating unit , which is not always easy to achieve . <h> Cost <p> A 600Watt panel , which should be sufficient to heat a small room will cost approximately -230 . <h> Installing infrared heating <p> Are you thinking local installer to help install infrared heating in your home , just fill in the form below and we will be in touch shortly ! 184576 @qwx384576 184572 @qwx384572 <h> 38 comments <p> Hi We are in an 1800s end terrace which obviously does n't  have cavity walls etc . We currently have conventional radiators running off a combi boiler running on LPG ( so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even with the lack of modern insulation ? <p> I have been using infrared heaters for about 4 years now . Initially I did n't  see the reductions in energy bills as I was running parallel storage heaters on economy 9 tariff . Eventually , I ripped all those out and replaced them with additional Herschel Infrared heating panels , with the initial ones being a Chinese import . In addition to that I switched my energy tariff to a simple standing charge with a variable charge on the bill . Last year the electricity bill went down by about a quarter , and this year about 10% further on last year . I believe this is a result of zoning my heaters better with the Herschel IQ units . So , now I can get the room to a decent temperature before I come home from work , and they then come on and off to about 20c . I would have them set to a lower temperature by I have a young daughter who needs the temperature to be a bit higher than just for my tolerances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just decided to do it . I can imagine the Brit public are a bit more sceptical . and maybe I would n't have taken the plunge myself without seeing them work first hand when I was stationed at a base in Germany . <p> If I bought an infrared heater or a panel as you call it , surely I would lose heat from the back of the panel does that make them inefficient ? Can I put some reflective matrial to the back of them as a diy thing to reflect the heat back ? <p> We are a major hardware retailer in slovenia and would like to start offering a range of infrared heating panels for our customers . Could you help put us in touch with manufacturers and distributors who would be willing to co-operate ? Also have you heard of Herschel , Koenighaus &amp; IR heaters ? Are any of these brands any good ? <p> Hi- we are currently renting a semi detached house with both houses sharing oneoio boiler and heating system . We would like to stop using the oil heating , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how would the cost of your system comparer+ in terms of running costs ? Thanks <p> Hi Neil . Not in the current update . We looked at the most recent consultation but it did n't  give any special consideration to infrared heating . We have responded to the consultation because we do n't  think recent developments in radiant heating have been reflected in their assessment . <p> Hi , I just got the infrared panels and I would like to ask if leaving them switched on non stop can damage them . I know that they suggest switching them off when you are not at home . Reason is that our walls are wet and we need to dry them as fast as possible . <p> Hi Denisa , Herschel infrared heating panels have a lifespan of around 100,000 hours so you should n't worry about leaving the panels on for long periods of time . We suggest switching the off when you are n't  at home due to unnecessary electrical usage . <p> I purchased infrared panels last winter , as I had put up with expensive , ineffective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious about the amount of heat and running costs . However , I am thrilled with them and highly recommend these panels . They are manufactured to a very high standard , throw out alot of heat and so cheap to run . They are also very easy to install and you can take them with you when you move ! The guys at Greenage are very helpful and friendly too . Very highly recommended = <p> I 'm about to buy a flat which has a 45 year old Selex Electricaire hearing system ( warm air via ducts in the wall ) which runs on on Economy 7 . The hot water runs of a PulsaCoil hot water cylinder also running on Economy 7 . If I decided to switch over to infra red panels ( which would presumably mean not using Economy 7 ) what are the options for hot water ? I mostly need it for a shower in the morning and washing a few pans in the evening so have no need to fill a bath regularly . The shower currently installed runs of the Pulsacoil . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for heating and water , I 'm curious to know how the hot water works if you move the heating to a standard rate for infrared panels . Thanks <p> We had storage heaters in our home I think from the 80s . We made the change to infrared and do n't  regret it ! The infrared heaters look sleeker and use less energy . Also can move off economy 7 which is great because the cheaper rate to be honest is n't far off what you can get as a standard rate from a smaller utility company ! <p> I am from a company that has recently developed the next generation of infrared heating . We are a stretch ceiling company , we have teamed up with a radiant heating ( infrared ) heating company . The results are a product called heat-in-a-sheet . We place radiant heating film behind our stretch ceilings to give efficient , economical , invisible heating . <p> I had infrared panels installed throughout my house about 5 yrs ago but have constantly had to have the panels replaced as they keep shorting out ( apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not german made as I believed when purchasing so I would say watch what you are being sold and maybe make sure they are manufactured in Germany <p> I am in the process of buying a small house , with two dimple storage heaters and three electric convector heaters in tiny kitchen , tiny bathroom and tiny 2nd bedroom . 1 . Would this type of heater heat a tiled surface in bathroom as well as the human . 2 . If you timed the heater to go on an hr before you go into the bathroom , would it be nice and warm . Or do n't  you use this heater like that . 3 . If you put the heater 3ft up on a wall in a small space , would not your feet be cold . ( tiny corner in L shaped sitting room ) . Many thanks . Caroline <p> Hi Caroline , the answer to questions 1 &amp; 2 are both yes ! Infrared panels do heat any solid object ( so humans and tiles ) . And yes switching it on a little early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it . In terms of your feet being cold , it is not really an issue since the infrared comes out the panels at all angles , so you feet should be fine ! <p> Have a panel as the primary heater in my living room with a stove providing the secondary heat on really cold days . Think the panel is slightly undersized though , I was told 45W/m2 but should have gone 60 I think . <p> Hi James , The price of gas is cheaper than the price of electricity , so in theory you would be better off having a boiler . However two things to consider firstly your boiler is old , therefore it will not be that efficient . Also with infrared you can heat just individual rooms , therefore they are more effective for space heating in some circumstances . <p> Hi , we do a product called heat-in-a-sheet , we use infrared heating panels and place them behind a stretched ceiling , you can then heat your entire room from above , much more efficient way of heating , cheaper to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we provide a thermostat in every room to control your home exactly how you want to . <p> Hi Laura , we are seeing more and more people switch from storage heaters to infrared and it is proving to be a very popular , stylish and efficient alternative . They can be controlled through a thermostat , which is great . <p> No , they hang like a picture . From research I positioned mine so that they are on a wall that is at a right angle to a window . The heat comes out like sunshine through a window ( radiant ? ) and seems to avoid having cold spots in the room . <p> Hi Jens , Thanks for getting in touch with us . We would be happy to ship to Norway , but we would obviously have to charge for delivery . If you would like a quote , either let us know the panels you want , or send us a floorplan so we can size the panels for you . <p> Will infrared heating panels be covered under the Green Deal Home Improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government website that it is an approved technology but cant find out whether it is available under the Green Deal . <p> Always liked the heat you get from radiant heating . Keeps the air nice and breathable but maintains temperature so you never feel cold . I have a few dogs as well and not having their hairs constantly circulated through convection heating is a plus ! <p> Hi James , The benefit of installing the panels would be that you would n't have to have bulky radiators around the house . In terms of cost , the price of kitting your house out with panels more often than not , costs around the same as a new boiler . However , because new condensing boilers are 90%+ efficient and the price of gas is around 4p/kwh then we would in your case recommend upgrading your boiler and only use the panels to supplement the central heating system . 
@@36748824 @5748824/ <h> Hydroelectric Power <h> Renewables <h> What is Hydroelectric Power ? <p> Hydroelectric power is a very well established form of providing energy . In the last decade , 20% of the world 's electricity came from hydroelectric plants ( 88% of the renewable energy supply ) . This balance will change as there are now competing renewable energy generating sources like- solar PV , and- wind power . Hydroelectric power means harnessing power from moving water using an electric generator . In the UK , total hydroelectric power capacity is just under 2% , which makes up under a fifth of the total renewable energy generation capacity . When people around the world think about hydroelectric power , they- probably think of the- Hoover Dam , which is located on the Colorado River in the USA , between Arizona and Nevada . It was completed in 1936 and had a maximum generating capacity of 1.3GW . <h> How does Hydroelectric Power Work ? <p> Power is generated as massive turbines spin , which is caused by water flowing over them . When the turbines spin the magnets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to electrical energy . The amount of power generated varies depending on the volume of water that passes over the turbines and the difference in height between the water source and the water 's outflow ( known as the head ) . There are different bands of hydroelectric power plant , divided by the amount of energy they can produce . The power plant divides are as follows " large ( few hundred MWs to 10GW ) , small ( up to 10MW ) , micro ( up to 100KW ) and pico ( under 5KW ) . <p> One of the major advantages of hydroelectric power is that it can be harnessed within seconds depending on demand , and as such is one of the only means of storing large quantities of electrical energy for peak demand . This is achieved by holding large amounts of water in a reservoir behind a dam with a hydroelectric power plant below . For example- Dinorwig , in Wales can help provide emergency power to fill the demand gaps from a city such as Liverpool . Most power stations , including fossil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they take time to warm up to produce the power , and cool down for maintenance . As a result , these are used to service base demand , then hydroelectric power can service any spikes in demand , and then water can be pumped- back up into the reservoirs when demand is less ( during the night ) . <h> Types of Hydroelectric Power <h> Hydroelectric Power Dam Storage <p> This is the conventional hydroelectric power station most people refer to when discussing hydroelectric power . It involves building a dam across a river , which traps the water creating a large artificial lake or reservoir behind it . To create electricity , gates are opened at- the- bottom of the dam and gravity pushes the water through the gates and down a pipe known as penstock , which delivers the water directly to the turbines built into the structure of the dam . This- fast flowing- water turns the turbines , and the- generator system converts this- kinetic energy into electrical energy . An example of a hydroelectric power dam , is the Kielder Water reservoir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest system in England . <h> Hydroelectric Power Pumped Storage <p> Pumped storage hydroelectric power , as described in the- Energy Storage- section requires two reservoirs , one at high altitude and one at low altitude . When the water is released- from the high altitude reservoir , energy is created by the downflow which is directed through high-pressure shafts , linked to turbines . This pressure drives the turbines which in turn power the generators that create the electricity . When the high altitude reservoir is empty , water is pumped back to it from the lower reservoir . This is linked with a pump shaft to the turbine shaft , using a motor to drive the pump . <p> In the UK , - Dinorwig- Hydroelectric Power plant uses pump motors that are powered from electricity from the grid , when the electricity is cheaper overnight , and demand is at its lowest . Hydroelectric power pumped storage generation therefore offers a critical back-up facility during periods of excessive demand , whilst being efficient in storing energy during periods of low demand . <h> Run-of-the-river- Hydroelectricity <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river- to create- electricity- without needing to build a dam . These types of hydroelectric power station- involve forcing the river flow through penstocks and turbines to create the- electricity , but the structures that are put- across- the river are far smaller than used in the hydroelectric- power dam storage described above . <p> In Beeston , Nottinghamshire , the hydroelectric power plant run by- United Utilities- is the largest run-of-the-river system in England . The difference between a dam and a run-of-the-river system is that the latter uses free flowing water , and has minimal storage capacity , which has its advantages and disadvantages . The system requires volume of water passing through and without storage capacity may lack the power of velocity . The dam and the river systems can both be example of diversion schemes , where they can both use water that is- channelled- from a river or a lake <h> Hydroelectric Power Industry Development <p> In the UK , the largest hydroelectric power station is at Dinorwig , which is capable of generating 1.8GW of power in just 12 seconds . However looking around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power station , the- Three Gorges Dam- located in China . This hydroelectric power plant has a generating capacity of 20.3GW , which at the time was expected to service 10% of China 's electricity needs , however since their demand has increased so dramatically in recent times , it currently only services about 3% . <p> Hydroelectric power generators in the UK are eligible for- Renewable Obligation Certificates- ( ROCs ) with stations commissioned after 2002 that have 20MW of power output and for all that are below this level . According to the- DECC , there is no national strategy for nationwide development of hydroelectric power , but the government is committed to do everything in its power to support developers , community initiatives and small scale developers being able to invest and build hydro projects . In addition , schemes up to 50kW can only apply for- FITs , whereas schemes between 50kW and 5MW can choose between FITs or ROCs. 
@@36748825 @5748825/ <h> How to deal with condensation <h> January 26 , 2015 <p> Condensation can cause some serious problems in the home , and at this time of year the problem only gets worse . How can you prevent it ? How can you fight it ? And how can you defeat it long term ? <h> What causes condensation ? <p> Condensation has become more of a problem in recent years . This is because of a number of developments that have led to a perfect storm of moisture in the home . Firstly , homes are heated far more than they used to be " central heating is everywhere , and hot water is used liberally . Warmer air can trap more moisture , and there is more moisture available . That leads to our second reason " homes use more moisture generating appliances than ever before : tumble dryers , washing machines , power showers and dishwashers all send beads of moisture into the atmosphere of the home . When colder weather comes , that leads to more moisture collecting on people 's windows and walls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to damp , and damage the fabric of the property . Mould is bad news for your health , your home and the appearance of your property , but it is n't just mould on the walls you need to worry about ; in some more extreme cases the damp can cause damage to your roof and loft , your floorboards and your appliances . <h> Is your damp caused by condensation ? <p> We do get lots of people asking what is causing their damp , and there are a few different potential causes with very different solutions . If you are sure your damp is being caused by condensation , or you have a problem with condensation in itself , then we have some potential solutions below . If your damp is penetrating or rising damp , then you will need an alternative solution . You can read more about the different types of damp here . <h> Control the humidity <p> It may seem obvious , but reducing the moisture being created in the home , and removing it where possible , will reduce the condensation problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example : <p> An extractor fan is a form of mechanical ventilation that takes moist air in your bathroom and ejects it outside . This can work really well if your condensation is mainly in the bathroom and caused by your hot showers . <p> A dehumidifier will extract moisture from the air , reducing the humidity in the room . These really do work well , but they are expensive to run in the long term , and can be a little noisy . <p> Fitting vents to your windows , or installing windows with vents , will allow cooler dryer air to enter the room , diffusing the moister air and reducing condensation . Too much ventilation will make your home draughty however . <p> You can take a more proactive approach by reducing the generation of moisture . Try not to take too hot a shower , and open the windows when you are cooking something on the hob , or having a wash . <p> If condensation builds up on your windows , wipe it down with a cloth . This is obviously not something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the short term it will help . <p> Insulation prevents condensation <h> Insulation reduces condesation <p> Installing wall insulation is a great way to combat damp . For those with old solid walls , condensation based damp can be a real problem . This is because thin , uninsulated walls are cold , and moisture from the warm air condenses on its surface , making it moist and a breeding ground for mould . Insulating the walls helps increase the internal surface temperature of the walls , which reduces the amount of moisture that can condense on the wall . <h> Mould Proofing <p> If you have particular problem areas where the condensation is causing mould , rather than a more general problem across the home , there are certain tactics you can use against that area . Mould proofing products like Asanex will kill off any mould on the wall and provide a protective coating to discourage mould growth in future . <p> productbox id= " 15381 ? /productbox <p> Using direct heating in a problem area is also a really good idea .

@@36748826 @5748826/ <h> External Solid Wall Insulation <h> Insulation <h> Why choose solid wall insulation ? <p> Most properties built prior to 1930 were constructed with solid walls , so they do n't  have cavities that can be injected with insulation . These solid wall properties can- be insulated with external solid wall insulation . The purpose of insulating in this manner is to slow the movement of heat out through the walls , thereby dramatically reducing heating demand . <p> In most cases , homeowners get in a professional to install solid wall insulation ; it is not normally considered a DIY job . Because the insulating process involves covering the original brickwork , the process can significantly alter the appearance of the property . Since the outside walls are highly visible , it is advisable to get someone who knows what they are doing to install it ! <p> There are three types of insulation that can be attached to the outside of the home : expanded polystyrene , mineral wool and phenolic resin . Expanded polystyrene ( known as EPS ) is certainly the most popular , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the works. - Phenolic resin is used when space is a premium , since you can use less of this type of insulation to achieve the required U-value . <p> Mineral wool can also be used to insulate solid walls and some people choose it- because it is breathable . If it is picked for this reason , it is very important that no acrylic render is- used to finish the project , - since it is not breathable and therefore defeats the object ! <h> Solid wall insulation must adhere to building regulations <p> When solid wall insulation is installed on the external walls of the home , it must adhere to building regulations . In this case it is referring- to the thermal performance of the insulation ; the solid wall insulation must achieve a U-value of 0.30 watts/m2k . With expanded polystyrene , this means that at least 90mm of insulation needs to be used - but obviously the thicker the material , the better its insulating performance . <p> For mineral wool you need 110mm of insulation to achieve the required U-value and for the phenolic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space is a premium . <h> Solid wall insulation sometimes needs planning permission <p> According to the planning portal , planning permission is not normally required- for installing solid wall insulation , provided the external appearance of the property does n't  change . If your property is brick and unpainted , changing its colour with render will require planning permission . Also , if- the building is listed or is in a conservation area you should consult your local planning authority . <p> From our experience of installing solid wall insulation across London , it seems there is no- standard approach to how the councils judge what is acceptable and what is n't , so if in doubt , it is probably worth asking the question ! <h> How is solid wall insulation installed ? <p> Firstly , if the property has existing render , a render test must be carried out to see if it is strong enough to hold the insulation . If not , all the existing render will need to be removed prior to attaching the insulation to the brickwork . If the render test shows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ render can simply be smoothed , ready for the insulation to be applied directly on to it . <p> Another important step prior to installing any external wall insulation is to remove any pipework from the outside of the building . These will be reinstalled at the end of the process ( and maybe extended in some instances as necessary ) ; this is one of main reasons that the insulating process is expensive and time-consuming . <h> Applying the insulation and finishing <p> The process is relatively complex , but the basic steps are outlined below : <p> Insulating panels are fixed to the wall using adhesive mortar . <p> Plastic capped fixings are driven through the insulating panels and around their perimeter into the wall to tie the panels securely to the wall . <p> Mortar is then applied over the insulating panels and the fixings . <p> An insulating mesh is then sunk into the mortar to hold the panels in position . <p> The mortar is sanded and painted with primer to prepare it for the render <p> The render finish is applied ( available in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video where we demonstrate how solid walls are insulated externally : <h> What finishes are possible ? <p> As the insulation goes on the outside of your house , it is important that you get the finish that you want . <p> A house pre and post solid wall insulation <p> On the whole , the most cost-effective way- of insulating your solid walls is- to finish it- with a simple white render . However there is a huge variety of finishes possible : smooth , textured or painted , tiled , panelled , pebble-dashed or finished with realistic brick slips . <h> External solid wall insulation and damp <p> External wall insulation is a great way to protect against penetrating damp , creating a new weatherproof layer on the outside of the building , and slowing the movement of heat through the walls . Another advantage of solid wall insulation is that it will cause the temperature of the walls themselves to rise . This means if there is lots of water vapour in the air ( from cooking or washing for example ) , this will no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a benefit , it- is still important to consider ventilation in the home regardless of whether you insulate or not . This can be done by installing more vents or- by making behavioural changes like opening windows and doors while cooking . <h> Cost and financing external wall insulation <p> The cost of- solid wall insulation is roughly -100/m2 , so it is not cheap . However , it can be really worthwhile in the long run . While government grants have now been wound down , there are occasionally local council grants available for eligible people , so it is worth checking . Also , some companies will offer finance . <h> Advantages of solid wall insulation <p> The insulation will take the U-value of your walls down to just 0.3w/m2k , equivalent to a brand new cavity wall built today therefore your heating bills will be significantly lower . <p> Solid wall insulation stops penetrating damp . <p> The insulation can improve the appearance of your home especially if you are replacing pebbledash . <p> It can also really help reduce noise entering the home , so if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing <p> Since the walls get warmer , they act as a heat store so rooms will take longer to cool down . <p> For a more detailed look at the advantages of solid wall insulation please click here . <h> Installing solid wall insulation <p> Interested map . 184568 @qwx384568 <p> Interested in getting external solid wall insulation ?

You do n't  have to advise the insurance company that the measure has been fitted . You would n't do so if you installed new windows or had a loft extension built .

If not , 1 ) does it not pose a FIRE risk(*) for close neighbours ? 2 ) does it comply with building regulations in UK ( * ) as EPS is lightweight and could detach / fly away in case of fire . Possibly landing on neighbour property <p> This is to the worried comment . What about wooden frame windows , thatched roofs , timber frame properties , wooden front doors , roof timber and a list of other building materials that could be flammable . In the Greenfell witness accounts , I heard one of the victims shout out how their window was on fire . Presume the windows in the flats were uPVC ? ! <p> Hi , Grey EPS is not fireproof . It would melt and eventually burn if you put a flame to it ( like many building materials ) . The key is how it is installed . the EPS is attached to the wall via a cement based adhesive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of the insulation . Therefore the insulation material is cocooned within non combustible adhesive it is therefore safe ! To be sure , always look for a BBA approved EWI Product , Sto , EWI Pro , Weber etc . All have been tested rigorously and do comply with building regs . <p> In response to the other question is hugely unlikely the boards could detach and fly away . They are held to the wall with cement based adhesive . They are then held in place mechanically with mechanical fixings then finally they are further reinforced to the wall by a fibreglass mesh / cement layer . <p> Depends which products . Mineral wool ( e.g. Rockwool ) is 100% non combustable it is made of stone . In external wall insulation systems though the insulation is enclosed within a concrete based mortar which helps . <p> The rainscreen cladding system used on the Grenfell tower was as far as we understand made of uncovered insulation ( i.e.the fire could touch the insulation material itself ) .

Basically , the insulation would have to be cut into ( using an angle grinder normally ) and then made good once the new extension has been built . Normally much of the damage of cutting into the insulation can be hidden using lead flashing provided you know exactly where the extension will be coming up to on the insulation . <p> We , ve just moved into a retirement village , which has been thermally insulated and rendered . As it has a thin shell of rendering , is it possible to fit a thin lightweight aluminium no parking sign up on the wall without causing any damage , could plastic rawplugs be used with a sealsnt on the rear of the screw to secure it <p> Hi Gregory It should be possible in theory , but it could affect your installer-backed warranty . The best idea is to contact the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch with the system manufacturer . <p> Hi John , As far as I can see , Secotherm is just a type of waterproof ( clear ) paint . Basically the paint is painted on the exterior of the property and since it is waterproof it stops penetrating damp . The reason this company reference energy savings is that dry walls are better insulators than wet walls . Test data has demonstrated that dry bricks have approximately twice the thermal efficiency of saturated bricks . It is a sound theory however I would not like to put a value on the kinds of savings that Secotherm would produce , because it depends on how damp your home is at present ! You would be better off adding insulation externally or internally to the walls exposed to the outside . With this , provided you add sufficient insulation then you will definitely see decent savings . <p> To be honest , it is the same kind of reasoning that DPC injection cream manufacturers use . The DPC is installed when properties are built to help prevent water from being pulled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barrier to the passage of water . In older properties , the DPC can sometimes disintegrate , meaning water can travel up the wall . The DPC injection cream is injected into the wall to try to re-create a new DPC to help stop damp travel upwards . So the theory is , that this cream will help stop water being pulled up the walls ( rising damp ) which will help keep the walls dry , which should therefore help the performance of the brick in terms of heatloss . <p> As I said , I think the real energy savings will come from the external wall insulation basically because the render will also provide this water proof coating but you will also benefit from far slower heat loss ( in the winter ) and heat gain during the summer . <p> Hi Marion , Was the company PAS 2030 certified ? If so , any remedial work needed because of a fault by the installer should be covered by insurance . Dig out your paperwork ! Bear in mind thought that the wall may be damp due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very unlikely to have been directly caused by the external wall insulation . <p> Hi Martin , unfortunately not at the moment . Not sure whether grant based schemes will make a return as they were in the previous iterations of Government energy saving policy . The latest Government review into energy saving only mentions finance based mechanisms , and there is little on " grants " , only glancing ECO , which can vary depending on the funding levels from the energy companies . <p> I have a 1975 bungalow . It is timber frame with block work covered with harling . There is a small amount of cavity wall insulation but not enough and there appear to be gaps . Is it possible to put insulation on the outside of walls like this . If yes , are there any firms carrying out this work . I live in Midlothian , Scotland . <p> Hi Jan , there are a few schemes running with small grant pots available , but they tend to be very localised to specific locations around the country ( for example there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not heard of any being available of the Isle of Wight at the minute . <p> We are very interested in getting solid wall insulation installed and we are based near swansea in south wales . Can you recommend an installer for us in the area . Are there accreditations that installers need to have ? Thanks for your help ! <p> Hi Gary , this depends on the strength of the existing render we would recommend doing pull test on the underlying render to see that it will support the new layer of render on top . If the existing pebbledash is flaking off or coming off in parts , we would definitely recommend stripping the whole thing prior to applying the new render layer . Adding an insulation layer under the render helps ( as in solid wall insulation ) because these are attached with mechanical fixings so that helps tie the system to the wall . <p> I had external wall insulation installed over 2 years ago using the EWI Pro Insulation system . In the end I had a choice of using a company called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the end I chose my builder instead of the contractor to my detriment but anyhow we got there in the end . I am planning on adding a side return which will go into the system and potentially damage it . Do you know what am I best options to obviously preserve the integrity of the EWI system as well as continuing the works ? Also what do I do about colour matching of render , so I get exact texture . Should I speak to EWI Pro Insulation Systems direct ? Also do you know if Pro EWIs are one of your approved installers ? <p> Hi Ian , You can indeed there are two ways the first is fixings that are anchored into wall itself ( the brick part ) . There are also spiral fixings which can be used these basically have a very wide thread to spread the load through more area of the insulation . <p> Is there a company you can recommend in Bristol for external wall insulation . My house is in the conservation area and I will need planning from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I like to know is there any grant available for wall insulation in our area and the cost of insulate my house which is four floors and just insulate the back wall and side . Thank you . <p> Hi Xav , we will come back to you on this ! We are waiting on a formal response from building control . This does occur quite a lot with solid wall insulation espically when you have semi detached properties with thin alley ways between them . <p> We got external wall insulation about a year ago . During a recent session of heavy rain , water started getting in around one of the windows frames . <p> The only way I can think this could be happening is if water is running between the external wall and the external insulation but your video suggests that that should not happen due to the panel being firmly fixed to the wall . <p> Hi John , this may be the case . With wet fix solid wall insulation systems ( when the boards are attached to the walls with adhesive as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adhesive is applied to the perimeter of each board as a minimum before it is fixed to the wall . There are companies out there who install dry solid wall insulation systems ( just use the mechanical fixings to tie the boards to the wall ) . In this case , water could travel down the back of the boards , so they need to be very carefully sealed at the edges of the walls ( by the soffit , DPC etc ) . <p> The problem with water getting behind solid wall insulation is that during colder weather , the water could freeze and expand pinging the boards off the wall . We would always recommend going with a wet solid wall insulation system . <p> Thank you for all your help ! We have just had the insulation installed by an installer you recommended over in Essex and the house looks all the better for it . Obviously ca n't really feel any benefits yet in terms of energy savings as heating has been off but hopefully next year we will really benefit . Anyway just a quick note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enquiry and following up to see we were happy , a thoroughly proffesional service ! <p> Hi there , I am looking for an installer in the Essex , Suffolk area . We have a typical 4 bedroom semi-detached house in Braintree . Been struggling to find a good ewi or rendering company as most of the ones that I call off this Government list will only do work for people with benefits . Also since we are going to live in this house ( touch wood ) for at least the next 15yrs or so , I do n't  want any expenses spared and want the best system . I have heard Sto , Baumit , EWI Pro Insulation and Weber sell quality products . Please do n't  offer me installers that offer acrylic render finishes , I expect my house to breathe once the insulation is applied . <p> we got external wall insulation under the GDHIF scheme . Total job was 9850 and we got -6k off the cost of the works . We save approximately 600 a year on our energy bills now due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The render finish has also really improved the look of our home ( used to be pebble dash ) . I know it is expensive ( unless you can get your hands on a grant ! ) but it really is worth it . <p> Hi Ben , thanks for your comment . You were lucky to have got on that GDHIF scheme it went extremely quickly ! In our opinion solid wall insulation is one of the best energy saving measures out there . The reason being is that you really do produce substantial energy savings . Take cavity wall insulation for example older uninsulated cavity walls tend to only be 50mm thick at the most , so you are therefore limited to 50mm of insulation . With external wall insulation , in theory there is no limit to the thickness of the insulation you use therefore you can use a lot and get huge energy savings ! <p> Having tried to get cavity wall insulation installed , we ended up getting solid wall insulation installed on our house after we learnt we did n't  have cavity walls ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has made a tremendous difference to both the appearance of our home and also the energy bills . I reckon the are less than half what they were last year . The insulation means the house warms up in about an hour and stays warm . It used to be on a programmer to come on at 5am and I do n't  think the house ever hit the 20 degrees thermostat setting so the heating was on all day ! Really happy with the result . <p> Hi Seb , some companies do use PIR board ( like celotex / kingspan ) . The danger is though that this can sometimes shrink over time , so cracks appear in the render which can then lead to water ingress and all sorts . To be honest , you are better off using EPS or mineral wool ( or even something like cork ) . Just use a slightly thinner amount obviously you wo n't achieve the same thermal performance , but you will get the benefits of the trade off between space taken up and improved thermal performance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through for a quote for external solid wall insulation . The bungalow at 38a Rustat Rd is 13.6m x 11.4m , and the external walls will be at 2.4m . The property is undergoing renovation at the moment , and there will be 3 sets of 3m bi-fold doors on the back elevation . Please mail me if you need any other info <p> I 've noticed the dry fixed systems are cheaper than ones that require adhesives . But adhesive solid wall insulation systems like Jub , Alumasc and EWI Pro require less fixings than a dry Weatherby one surely there is then no difference on performance ? <p> We had this done after getting our holiday home done out in Geneva where the temperatures get much lower . The solid wall insulation makes a massive massive difference . House is always nice and warm . Put heating on it stays hot forever . In uk temps are warmer so obviously less of an impact but still definitely worth doing . <p> Hi Xander , thanks for your comment I think the solid wall insulation industry is far better established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catching up basically because there has been a shift in the Governments view on this . The reason for this is that there are very few cavity wall properties that are still to be insulated , so they have had little choice but to start targeting the older solid wall properties . <p> External wall insulation my daughtermoved into a property with insalation on her property i notice they have not put any pattreses on the outside fittings aerials.lights rain water down pipes can these pattresses be put in know or would it cause a problem.Graham <p> You can extend the roof line or cap the top of the external wall insulation ( the capping is far cheaper ) . In many cases however the existing soffit extends well over the wall and therefore can house the thicker external walls . <p> we looked at getting solid wall insulation on the flank wall of our house but unfortunately the pathway between our property and the neighbours was too narrow for conventional scaffolding . It is very very cold in december till March and I was wondering if a ) there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ladders maybe ? and b ) if we cant get solid wall insulation on our home what other options do we have aside from internal insulation . We definitely cant afford to lose the space off that wall and I think the upheaval would give the missus a breakdown . Is there a thinner product that can go on externally that really helps prevent heat loss ? I did read about an insulating paint but not sure if that would provide any real heat savings ? <p> Hi James , I live in Perivale , north-west London and my mum is on the state pension . I heard from one of the neighbours that there is Government funded scheme to help with the wall insulation . Do you have any more information on this ? My mum is elderly and frail and her current heating just can not warm the front room enough for her to sit during the cold . <p> Hi Jane , their are two streams of grant funding kicking about at the moment . The first is the ECO funding this is not a set amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting from the improvement in energy efficiency from the houses current state to the new more energy efficiency state . Not all companies offer this so you will need to find a local company that does and also it is difficult to give you the exact amount of the grant becuase it depends on the size of the property , what type of property it is and also the existing efficiency . <p> The other type of funding is known as the Green Deal community funding this is a lot simpler and tends to be a set value however not many councils have access to this so you will need to check I actually think off the top of my head their is funding in North London <p> Some interesting comments . We got solid wall insulation installed under the HIF scheme and some guys who could n't speak a word of English did a really shoody job . We then found another installer to come and rectify the works , but it came at great expense . I am surprised that the first group of installers were on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get through the quality checks . Anyway now works are done and we are happy . It looks good and over these winter months it has made a considerable difference . It is amazing though how much the quality of the installers varied . ADVICE IS ALWAYS TO CHECK SOME WORKS THEY HAVE PREVIOUSLY CARRIED OUT AND GET A CHARACTER REFERENCE FROM A PREVIOUS CUSTOMER OF THEIRS ! <p> Hi I 'm enquring about the rendering grant , is this a full grant ? I own a 2 bed mid terrace and I am looking to get it re rendered as the rendering that is on now is n't very good and looks messy , is there anything you can do ? <p> Hi Janeking , yes it does the window will be recessed after the insulation is added . How much is dependant on how much solid wall insulation is added . When we install solid wall insulation on properties , we do normally suggest windows are done at the same time for two reasons . Firstly the windows can be pulled out a little so they do n't  look so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid wall insulation is installed is a bit of a pain because it will damage the insulation meaning you will need to pay the solid wall installer to carry out repair works . <p> Thanks for your comments Dan , agree with everything you say . The Government really is making the energy saving sector a challenge at the moment , but I think long term , solid wall insulation could be a winner . I think one thing you have missed is that old cavity walls are limited by the width of the cavity in terms of the thermal performance upgrade they can receive . Older cavity walled properties could have a cavity just 40mm thick . This means that even if you were to go with cavity wall insulation , you would only be 0.65w/m2k . If you install 100mm of EPS solid wall insulation , you can acheive a u-value of 0.28w/m2k . This is a substantial improvement , so it may be worth considering solid wall insulation even if you have cavity walls ! Completely agree though it makes sense for people have previously rendered properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Government are even looking to change that , so take the VAT up to 20% which is n't going to help the industry establish itself . Not sure what is going on a DECC , but it seems that energy efficiency is taking a serious back seat ! <p> We have been installing solid wall insulation across London under the various government schemes ( GDHIF , ECO etc ) . On the whole the customers who have had the solid wall insulation installed on their properties have been enormously happy with the results . More even temperatures in their home and also not needing to turn the heating on until it gets really cold ! The issue the industry now faces is that despite 7 million properties requiring solid wall insulation , the cost of getting it installed is very expensive . So without the subsidies are people actually going to get it in their home ? I guess there are two things that will make it more attractive . Firstly energy bills could go up . Especially in the UK where we need to upgrade our energy generating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills . Obviously the higher the energy bills the bigger the energy savings resulting from solid wall insulation so this should make it more attractive . Secondly , with VAT where it currently is for solid wall insulation ( 5% instead of 20% for other works ) the cost of getting a house re-rendered or having solid wall insulation installed is actually not that far apart . That means that for homes who are considering re-rendering their properties then it is well worth it , as they will also benefit from the energy savings . <p> 2 pieces of advice for those looking to install solid wall insulation on their home 1 . make sure you do some research on the installer . A huge number of installers have popped up over the last 18 months . Make sure you can check their previous work and ideally speak to a customer of theirs . 2 . Make sure they are using a BBA product . There are about 40 systems available in the UK , but some of these havent been through the process and as such I would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems being installed . <p> As a final point if you are having solid wall insulation installed check the installers maintenance recommendations . Many installers hide the fact the walls will need re-painting in 10 or so years . If you have a 4 story house the cost of the scaffolding to get this done can be expensive ! <p> Hi , I am based in Reading and I am looking to get solid wall insulation on my property . The house is already rendered so for me it makes sense to add insulation instead of simply re-rendering the walls . Having said that it does a little bit depend on price , so far I have had quotes ranging from -45 /m2 to 85 /m2 for render . The cheap quote does n't  include this mesh that people now recommend so probably can discount that one , but wondering how much it would cost me approximately to insulate a 3 bed semi-detached house with solid wall insulation . I want to know whether the incremental costs of insulating and re-rendering are worth it based on the energy savings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similiar property ? Any thoughts / help would be greatly appreciated , very keen to move ahead before the cold weather sets in ! ! <p> Hi Nathan , As I think you may have suspected , insulating your walls as well as rendering is always going to be worthwhile if you are going to be rendering anyway . There are several good reasons for that : The VAT on render is 20% whereas for insulation it is 5% , so you immediately have a 15% saving with insulation works . The insulation will create big savings on your bills and help fight damp , whereas render will not really generate any return for you . You ca n't insulate without rendering , so it is a great time to insulate if you are rendering anyway . <p> The cost of render vs. insulation taking everything into account is n't that big . We reckon you are looking at -60/m for render vs. -100/m for insulation . When you factor in VAT and the savings , this difference disappears . <p> We had our external walls insulated by GreenAge / Beconstructive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site were polite and worked incredibly hard to get it all done . We had 85m2 insulated with the insulation in under 2 weeks although the weather was great . I look forward to seeing the impact on my heating bills as the weather begins to turn over the coming weeks ! On a quick side note though , lots of people in my neighbourhood have gone for cavity wall insulation ( with us it was n't an option ) but surely the old cavities are n't  that thick so you can put an awful lot more insulation on the outside of the wall or the inside ( inside the home ) compared to insulating a cavity wall ? Would be interesting to know the heat loss difference of a cavity wall versus a solid wall both of which have had the retrofit insulation installed on them . <p> We had solid wall insulation installed on the back of our 1905 mid terrace . They went for 90mm of EPS to take the u-value down to 0.3 which is apparently what is required for building regs . <p> We got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so have now had it in place for a year so I thought it would be fair for me to comment on its performance . <p> Well the first thing to note is that the rooms on the back of the property are far warmer . This was our main objective because that is where the kids rooms are and previously it has been freezing in these rooms . I am not sure on the exact energy savings , but if I were to guess I would say energy usage is about a third down so quite nice . The house is south facing , so one of the benefits we did n't expect was during the summer , the insulation seems to prevent the home getting too warm , so that was rather an unexpected but pleasant surprise . <p> In terms of downsides to the solid wall insulation , there really is just one and that is the fact we have lost the brick feel . I know that you can get fake bricks ' to replicate the brick finish , but I am not sure how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shame , but nevertheless really happy we went through with it . <p> I have seen subsequently that the payments for the home improvement fund have been reducing for solid wall insulation , so I recommend if you are planning on doing it to get in quick . <p> The other thing worth mentioning and not something that applied to us , but did aplly to friends of ours was that if you need to render the property because the old render looks dated etc , then this is a great time to do it , because the grants more than cover the additional cost of the solid wall insulation . <p> All in all , I am really glad we went for it and have since recommended it to friends . <p> Hi Keith , the mineral wool is breathable and fire resistant but is significantly more expensive . The polystyrene ( EPS ) board has a higher thermal efficiency , so you can achieve the same U-value with less material it is also far cheaper . 99 times out of 100 we are installing EPS to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) mineral wool is specified . The truth is that both products work equally well and therefore the EPS is out preference because the payback is better for the end user , but I am sure others will want to have their say ! ! <p> I live in Chalfont St. Peter , Buckinghamshire in a 1910 detached house . There have been alterations done to it over time ( side extension , back diner and conservatory + loft extension ) , but the majority of walls are still solid 25cm brick and I think we would benefit from wall cladding . Do you know of any show homes near where I live that I can drive and have a look . While I have done a lot of reading about the insulation procedure I would still like to have a look for myself . Thanks for any help . <p> Try and get solid wall insulation installed under the Green Deal Community Fund . These are funds allocated to local boroughs / councils and the funding tends to be more generous than the GDHIF scheme . We live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is -5k , but there does n't  need to be any customer contribution ; this is substantially higher than the GDHIF scheme so worth taking a look at . There are equivalent schemes running across the UK so do some research ! Solid wall insualtion is not cheap , but these schemes make the payback on getting the insulation installed just a couple of years .. <p> Hi Phil agreed , it is definitely worth shopping around and trying to secure the biggest grants . The good thing about carrying out the solid wall insulation via these Green Deal community fund is that all the works will be carried out under the PAS2030 framework which will mean you will get a 25 year warranty . <p> I like the look of the solid wall insulation , my property has render already and I guess it makes sense to install the solid wall insulation at the same time . My worry though is how long will the insulation last . On top of this I also need to know if I want to add things later like a satellite dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess key to everything is not letting water getting behind the insulation itself , but as soon as you drill a hole in it this makes a gap for the water to get in . Does this then void the warranty ? <p> Hi Jappie , Like a jumper the thicker you go for the better in terms of energy savings but the material plays a part too ! If you go for 150mm insulation then you will definitely see more substantial energy savings and the price difference will be fairly small . If you insulate solid walls using 150mm of insulation then the problem is that it limits the amount of light entering the home . 100mm is about the limit before there is any impact on light but you have mentioned this is for the flank wall so there is actually no issue here . <p> I am very interested in getting solid wall insulation on my home . We have an extremely cold flank wall and I think this might be just the ticket . What thickness is best , there are no windows , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the cost . I know you suggest 100mm , but would it be better for me to go 150mm instead ? What would the cost difference be and what kind of energy savings would I get . The wall is about 7m long by 6m high . <p> It seems expensive with limited ROI . I have an old 1895 home and have often considered getting solid wall insulation . My energy bills are approximately -3k per year , I just want to know what the payback would be like before I go and spend money getting the works carried out only to find I need to live till 273 years old to see me get my money back ! <p> Hi Kremp , By the sounds of it your home is an absolute prime candidate . If your energy bills are that high , a 25% saving on your bills would give you a -750 saving per year . Combine that with a government GDHIF grant of nearly -4,000 and the payback will be swift . Even with a cost of -10,000 you are looking at a payback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people underestimate the difference it makes you are taking on of the most inefficient types of wall and bringing it up to the standard of a new build . <p> We had 150mm of phenolic foam added to our house when we built it on the outside walls , so I think we are near passivhaus now . It is such a good idea , the temperature in the home barely changes throughout the year . The only issue we currently are finding is solar gain on bi-fold doors , but I think we are looking at integrated blinds here to stop this . I cant believe it has taken so long for interest in solid wall insulation to ramp up . <p> We got our home insulated as part of the home improvement scheme . We got -4k towards it in January and I can honestly say it has made a huge difference to my home . Our house was already rendered , so putting the solid wall insulation did n't  even change the appearance to be honest . I reckon it is just about the best solution for those horrible pebble dashed houses ! 
@@36748827 @5748827/ <p> In this blog we take a look at your options and help you find out what is best for your property " beginning with the cheapest options first : <h> Draught proofing your sash windows <p> Draught proofing is something you can get done professionally whilst refurbishing the windows , or as a separate service , and it is also covered under the Green Deal . Draught proofing is the most cost-effective way of improving the efficiency of your windows , and is particularly effective on sash windows , as they are more prone to draughts than standard windows . It essentially involves creating an air tight seal around the frame of each of the sliding windows in the sash frame . <p> Draught proofing your windows can save you around -50 a year , so it is definitely worth considering . You can get a professional to draught proof your home , and this will cost between -200-400 , but you can also DIY it if you feel up to the task , at a fraction of this cost . You can find out more about draught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draught proofing directly through our energy efficiency store here . <h> Installing curtains and blinds <p> Thick curtains are also often overlooked as a means to help reduce heat loss from windows . If you have a pair of existing curtains on the sash window , see if you can install thermal curtain lining to the back of them to improve their thermal efficiency . <p> If you have no curtains at all , consider installing them since during the winter a thick pair of curtains can really help stop cold draughts . <p> The advantage of this option is that if you 're adept at DIY around the house you should be able to install the railing and curtains yourself . The disadvantage is that not everyone likes the sight of curtains and they may block some useful light , making the place look gloomier than it should do . <h> Installing secondary glazing to sash windows <p> There are two types of secondary glazing available on the market place today fixed permanent glazing and temporary secondary glazing . <p> Fixed secondary glazing normally has panels that slide over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window frame . Once frowned upon as a cheap , ugly addition to a home , modern secondary glazing can actually look fairly stylish , and vastly improve the thermal performance of the window . <p> The other secondary option is temporary secondary glazing , like Ecoease for example . This is usually a plastic made-to-measure window , which is attached to your current window from the inside using a magnet . They are really unobtrusive , take up no space on your windowsill and can be fitted as a DIY job . You can see a video of Ecoease being fitted here . <h> FROM -110/m2 <p> Both secondary glazing options are significantly cheaper than new double glazing , and they allow you to keep the period features intact , since your home will look identical from the outside . <p> Permanent secondary glazing is also covered under the green deal , and you could be looking at a bill of around -300 per window compared to the cost of new double glazed sash at well over -1,300 per window . Temporary secondary glazing is cheaper than permanent secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -110 per square meter . <h> Refurbishing sash windows <p> Sash windows are designed to be refurbished regularly , every decade or so . Over time , the frame and glass will become loose in the sash box , as a result of the movements of the house along with the expansion and contraction of the wood this means that gaps for draughts are more likely to develop over the years . In addition , since most older sash windows are made from wood , they are more likely to rot over time , so regular painting is essential to help prevent this . <p> Refurbishing will of course cost far less ( approximately -200 a window ) than new windows , and could give your windows a new lease of life . The refurbishing process involves being dismantled , eased , adjusted , re-aligned , re-corded and re-assembled , and having a brush pile draught sealing system installed . As well as improving the efficiency of the windows it will also make them smoother to open and help cut out draughts . It is an ideal time to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost for this service is around -200 per window , so it is not dirt cheap , but significantly less expensive than new windows ! Sometimes it can save you just as much as new windows as well . <h> Double glazing sash windows <p> Replacing your sash windows with double glazing sash units is the last option and the most expensive . <p> To give you an idea of cost , wooden sash windows can cost around -1,300 each , whilst uPVC tend to be cheaper at about -700 per window . Sash double glazing windows are still much more expensive than getting traditional double glazing , which works out at about -300 per window on average . <p> As we have mentioned elsewhere , it is never cost-effective in terms of energy efficiency to switch to double glazing , even on an older property with large sash windows . The energy savings by replacing single glazed windows with double glazed are nowhere near as substantial as many window companies claim . Having said that , new windows can absolutely improve the appearance of the property and also make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it is still something we would recommend if funds are available . <h> uPVC sash windows <p> uPVC sash windows are now available , and they are about a third cheaper than wooden sash equivalents . The advantage of uPVC of course is that less maintenance is required , and they generally come with lengthy guarantees , but their lifespan is likely to be less than well-maintained wooden sash windows . Unfortunately , uPVC also have the potential to devalue a period property , as people prefer the original wooden windows aesthetically . <h> Can I get a Government subsidy to cover sash window replacement ? <p> There are no national grants as such for new windows , but one option for those still keen on new double glazing is to speak to your local council 's domestic property services .

We had slimeline double glazing installed by a friend of ours who specialised in it . Having this process done eliminated our problem without changing the overall look of our windows .

I agree PVC is not an option , but if we replace our original sash windows with double glazed wooden ones in keeping with the original style will this also devalue our property ? <p> p.s. would I do anything different . I stripped and repainted , primer , undercoat gloss , pretty standard stuff . However next time I would look at a microporous paint or a traditional linseed based paint , that allows breathing on the exterior . Modern gloss paints are great but once they are breached , moisture can get in and then get trapped , allowing rotting from the inside . <p> I overhauled my sash windows , including the bay , had to cut out sills , rebalance etc . It seemed very daunting at first , but once I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably spent around -500 in materials , paint , rails , sills and new brushed beading , for a huge bay and double window sash . The result is draft free windows , no rattles , that is in keeping with the property . Next I will look at creating removable secondary glazing probably in hardwood frames , with brass hardware . The only other real option is to replace timber sash with new timber sash . I can absolutely guarantee plastic windows will not last as long nor can they be repaired . They might be more efficient but how long for that efficiency to recoup the initial installation cost , and what might pvc reduce in the selling price of a period property . PVC are a short term solution .

I did it over a summer and was thrilled with the result . When I was doing one of the windows I came across some newspaper which had been used as packing between the frame and the wall . The newspaper was 60 years old ! Give it a go , it may be time consuming but really is n't that difficult if you are a bit handy around the house !

But I 'm assuming that if all these tips are followed and its still not making a difference , then its time to replace the windows ? <p> No point replacing sash windows . I pay -1500 every few years to refurbish . Heavy curtains and lots of jumpers get me through winter .

@@36748829 @5748829/ <h> CHP Cogeneration <h> What is cogeneration ? <p> CHP cogeneration ( combined heat and power for industry ) follows the same processes and principles as- micro CHP boilers , but on a grander scale . When a fossil fuel power station produces electricity , it also produces a lot of waste heat . In fact 65% of the energy potential contained in the fuel turns to heat and only 35% is actually converted to electricity , which - shows that there is a large efficiency gap . The heat produced is in the form of steam , which is used to drive the electricity-producing turbines . When you drive past a power station you will have probably have noticed the large cooling towers releasing this steam into the atmosphere , which highlights the wasted heat . <p> The unique point about CHP Cogeneration is that it captures this steam and reuses it for other purposes , such as providing heating for local districts or towns that are close to the plant . In other cases CHP cogeneration plants can fit in tandem with existing industrial processes ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refineries . <h> Types of CHP cogeneration <p> As mentioned in the CHP boilers section , CHP cogeneration is underpinned by a number of different technological processes . The process that creates the energy required can either be a combustion process or a fuel cell chemical reaction . Both of these processes produce the heat and power to ensure they can be used for the purposes of CHP Cogeneration . A summary of the technological processes is in the sub-section below : <h> Combustion CHP Cogeneration <p> The structure of CHP cogeneration plants usually takes the form of an external combustion engine , which has been a technology widely used in steam engines . Many fuels can be utilised to produce the heat required including gas , coal , biomass , nuclear and geothermal . The fuel is combusted and this heats water , which is then forced into a pressurised boiler . This heat and pressure feeds the main engine or a turbine , which then rotates . The rotating motion then simply spins a large magnet ( main engine ) inside a coil of copper wire , known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converting mechanical energy into electrical energy . <p> The difference with CHP cogeneration and other plants is what happens with the steam and heat generated from the boiler that then leaves the system . If the infrastructure is in place , this heat can be released out of this process and potentially pumped to a nearby facility for a different purpose altogether . Some of the secondary activities that heat can be utilised for are , district heating ( as discussed above ) and to drive newly built water desalination plants . <p> You can also have CHP cogeneration with power plants that are not primarily there to generate electricity but that are there to support additional industrial processes . For example , a bottoming cycle industrial plant produces high temperature heat for an industrial process such as glass furnacing or metal manufacturing . In addition , a waste heat recovery boiler recaptures waste heat from the manufacturing heating process . This waste heat is then used to produce steam that drives a steam turbine to produce electricity . Since fuel is burned first in the production process , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990s- British Sugar- built a state-of-the-art CHP plant , using excess heat and electricity to support some of its secondary processes as well as providing district heating . <h> Fuel Cell CHP Cogeneration <p> An emerging CHP cogeneration technology is the fuel cell , where fuel , such as natural gas , is converted to electricity in a chemical reaction rather than a combustion process . Again , let 's talk a little bit first about this fascinating science . First requirement is to have- solid oxide fuel cells- ( SOFC ) , which are allowed to operate at high temperatures . The fuel cells then on one side chemically interact with a fuel input ( LPG , natural gas , hydrogen for example ) and on the other side with air . This combined reaction using an anode and a cathode and is then able to produce electricity and heat ( up to 1000 degrees centigrade ) . <p> The development of this technology for CHP cogeneration is ongoing , so that one day it can be used as a standard solution for both businesses and homes. - Companies such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of introducing this process alongside conventional combustion processes . An example of how this is utilised could be when a company is enhancing existing gas plants with fuel cell technology , to make sure the levels of efficiency increase . As we have already mentioned , the electrochemical process from fuel cells produces heat , and this is then separately captured and used in a secondary process . For example the heat can be used to create steam , which can then feed a combustion system to create secondary electricity . Any excess heat can be recycled further and used to supply district heating or to enable further industrial processes to take place . These processes and recycling heat for multiple uses , increases plant efficiency , which ensures that as little heat as possible is wasted . <h> CHP cogeneration industry development <p> The principles of CHP cogeneration have been around since the 1960s in the UK . For example the- Combined Heat and Power Association- ( CHPA ) was set up in 1966 as the District Heating Authority to highlight benefits of district heating , but now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach to heat and power . Industrial and domestic CHP cogeneration generators of electricity can currently make use of the- Renewable Obligation Certificates- ( ROCs ) and- Feed-in-Tariffs- ( FiTs ) respectively . More on this in the section below , as well as an explanation of the- Renewable Heat Incentive- ( RHI ) in more detail . <p> In the UK , the- Immingham CHP cogeneration plant- ( one of our featured case studies ) , has been in operation since 2004 , producing 1.2GW of electricity , making it one of Europe 's largest CHP cogeneration plants . Some of its uses are as follows : providing steam and electricity to the Humber Refinery , steam to a neighbouring refinery , and power back into the grid . <p> Now a bit about our neighbours in Europe : - CHP cogeneration is already used on a commercial scale in many Scandinavian countries , with 40% of Denmark 's total electricity capacity derived from this source , as is 30% of Finland 's . Germany on the other hand has also made its intentions clear in support of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scale down and decommission the existing civil nuclear power plant project. - However other parts of Europe like the UK have a lot of catching up to do to these countries . <h> Cogeneration CHP UK public policy <p> The- DECC- policy is to support measures such CHP cogeneration as well as solar commercial power plants , wind farms- and- nuclear power- to ensure that by 2020 the UK is in a good position to meet its emission reduction targets . The main policy areas that cover CHP cogeneration are summarised below : <h> Renewable Obligation and Feed-in-Tariffs <p> ROCs- are available to commercial electricity generators of CHP cogeneration , which are usually ones that are able to demonstrate the production of multiple MWh of electricity production ( also considered a metric that symbolises the starting point for mass scale consumption ) . The level of support varies depending on the CHP cogeneration type . For example , if combusting waste CHP cogeneration , then level of support is 1 ROC per MWh . On the other hand , if you are using dedicated- biomass- fuel with CHP cogeneration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitlement increases to 2 ROCs per MWh . <p> FiTs- on the other hand are an initiative to support micro generators of renewable electricity . If you are a small business or a community project ( and this is your first time involvement in electricity generation ) , please note to satisfy the FiT criteria , you need to have a declared net capacity greater than 50kW and up to and including 5MW- ( 2MW for- micro cogeneration CHP ) . Income can be earned both from the generation tariff and the export tariff . <p> These two policy areas are great incentives if you are looking to invest in renewable CHP cogeneration projects or if you are looking to start up your own renewable CHP cogeneration plant . <h> Renewable Heat Incentive <p> The- RHI- is a payment subsidy ( pence/kWh ) , for heat and hot water generated by households or businesses , using an eligible renewable technology , which includes CHP cogeneration . <h> District heating <p> In- March 2012 , the- DECC- set out a roadmap for district heating incentives . This has called on improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extract some of the excess heat and provide it for local homes and businesses . An apparent lack of investment in infrastructure is to blame for a lack of district heating incentives in this country .

District heating incentives for example would struggle to compete with existing infrastructure in large conurbations , but there appears to be an opportunity for connecting new out of town developments and/ or areas of the country which are currently off-grid . <p> Examples of some of the CHP cogeneration initiatives that could be implemented in the UK are as follows : heat from gas-fired CHP plants , - biomass- and- biogas , heat pumps , energy-from-waste , solar thermal , excess heat from industrial processes and power stations .

We all know that solar power uses the suns energy however , and during the winter , the sun is n't out as much " and it is n't as strong , so just how much can you expect of your solar PV or solar thermal during those long winter months ? <h> Solar PV relies on light not heat <p> Many people think that a hot sunny day will produce more electricity than a colder sunny day . This just is n't the case . Solar PV relies on the light of the sun , but higher temperatures actually reduce the effectiveness of the panels . So cold and bright are actually ideal conditions . <p> Having said that , the lower the sun is in the sky , the less energy will reach the panels . In winter , the sun will always be lower in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy . Couple that with the fact that winter days are shorter and unfortunately you can guarantee that the panels will not be as effective in winter . <p> So what are the figures ? The Energy Saving Trust have published some figures which suggest a standard 3kW system facing due south , producing around 300kWh during June and July , will produce around 75kWh in a winter month like December or January . So you are talking about a 5th of the energy production in the winter months . <h> Does solar thermal work in winter ? <p> So solar PV may not produce the kind of electricity you get in the summer , but it is still producing some energy . Let 's now compare this to solar thermal . Solar thermal heats water using the heat of the sun , so you would expect it to produce far less usable heat in the winter . <p> And again this is the case . We looked at a typical Viesmann solar thermal system , and they suggest that solar thermal should provide about 60% of your hot water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the height of summer , and about 25% during the winter . Solar thermal is affected by the loss of direct sunlight a bit more than PV and realistically you should not expect too much from your solar thermal during winter . They are also affected by cloud considerably more than solar PV , so a cloudy winter day you should not expect your solar thermal to do much at all . <p> You should note that evacuated tubes tend to work much better than the older style solar thermal systems in winter conditions , so whilst they will still only produce a small amount of your hot water , a modern evacuated tube system will provide more heat . <h> Can you optimise your panels for winter ? <p> During winter , the optimal angle for your panels will be lower , because the sun is lower in the sky . Some systems will allow you to alter the angle over the year to optimise the system , though this will depend on the mounting used . Some systems will track each day with the sun , whilst others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year . Most systems are fixed on roofs for domestic customers , so unfortunately there wo n't be anything you can do . <h> Can you rely on solar in winter ? <p> Unfortunately solar is not going to provide all your energy needs in winter , but people are sometimes surprised by just how much you can get out of some of these systems during the colder months . <p> Do n't rely on your panels in winter to heat your hot water or run your electric heating , but remember that the savings over the whole year should pay for the system in less than 10 years ! <h> 6 comments <p> Hi , thanks for your article , I really enjoyed it .

For one , boxes will compress the insulation , making it less effective in terms of energy savings . In addition , the wool is pretty horrible to touch ( although not our 100% sheep wool ! ) so actually venturing into the loft to get anything you have stored up there is also a pretty traumatic experience ! <p> Obviously one way of getting around this issue is simply boarding the loft and we come across lots of homes that do just that , resting the chipboard across the joists . The issue with this is that the recommended insulation depth is now 270mm ( according to UK building regulations ) and joists tend to be only 100mm tall , so it means that if the loft is insulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth of 100mm which is not really sufficient . <p> So how then do you create a solid storage platform in the loft will still managing to insulate to the required 270mm ? <h> Method 1 : Creating a warm loft <p> To be honest , this is our least favourite option , but only because insulating your loft should be really quick and easy . Creating a warm loft is more difficult , because you need to attach the insulation to the rafters " which is great once it is done , but having to fight gravity while installing it can be rather painful . <p> Essentially , a loft can be insulated either at joist level ( just above the ceiling of room directly below the loft space ) or at rafter level , which is between the rafters that support the roof of the loft . <p> We have written a far more detailed methodology of how to do this here , but by doing this , you can simply board up the joists ( or leave them boarded if they are already ) and it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rafter level means that heat can travel freely through the ceiling of your home into the loft space . <p> So the two drawbacks are the installation process itself , and the fact you are heating your loft , which in all likeliness is not used very often .

Obviously books and the like will fare better in a more consistent temperature rather than suddenly going from very cold to very warm . <h> Method 2 : Raising the height of your joists <p> This is our preferred method to be honest , and involves raising the level of the joists , on to which you can then attach the chipboard panels to create a solid storage surface . <p> The first way is to lay new joists at 90 degrees to the existing joists . This is relatively easy , but will mean purchasing new timber and also adding much more load ( essentially weight ! ) to the existing joists . <p> In order to do this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing joists .

If you have spotlights coming in to the roof , we suggest getting caps that sit on top of the fitting to help prevent them from overheating . <p> Once the initial layer of insulation has been laid between the joists , you then need to attach the loft storage stilts to the joists .

We recommend going for a wet system as this is better suited to heating larger surface areas like your living room and kitchen . <h> Installing the insulation <p> 1 . Prior to thinking about expensive measures like renewables , you first need to insulate the envelope of the house ( loft , walls and floors ) . In this instance it is an absolute must before starting the installing of the underfloor heating system . As mentioned the heating works at lower temperatures than conventional systems so it is imperative the heat they produce does n't escape , which will be the case if you get insulation. - <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fix some battens to the sides of the joists , whilst leaving enough headroom for the heating pipes and screed that will go above that . <p> 2 . Having put this in place you then install polystyrene boards like Celotex or Kingspan of variable thickness . The precise thickness of boards installed can vary from 25mm of insulation to 150mm of insulation as long as you leave a decent air gap between the boards and the ground to allow for ventilation and the prevention of damp <p> In the photo I made out the thickness to be 75mm , which was fixed between the joists of the whole floor area . <p> 3 .

A range of floor finishes can be applied to the screed layer including tiles , veneer or wooden boards . This entirely depends on your taste and preference . In my property example the home owner went for a veneer oak finish . <h> Underfloor heating with Renewables <p> It is also worth mentioning that underfloor heating works especially well with renewable heating solutions like air source heat pumps since they produce hot water at lower temperatures than traditional gas fired central heating systems .

The myth that uPVC windows do n't  require maintenance is complete tosh too .. I 'd be happy to fork out over double the cost per window for a guarantee 3x greater , a property resale value greater and a look far greater . If you think uPVC looks better or acceptable on a period property your slightly delusional . I 'd love to ban uPVC on some premier residential roads in London and let the dullards play penny pincher on other roads . <p> I agree with a lot of this but its simply not true that you have to go to hardwood for timber windows that last . Members of the Wood Window Alliance make windows from engineered slow grown softwood that is preservative treated and fully finished ( painted and glazed etc ) under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watt University , Edinburgh have shown that frames made to these standards can be expected to have a service life of around 60 years with normal maintenance .

I was dead set against upvc and got a quote for timber sash windows which looked great .

I got a quote in Irish Oak from a company called Roundbrand and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upvc now have a kind of grain effect which really sets off the look along with an external Georgian bar . I would ideally still rather have timber but the price difference made it a no brainer . <p> I have a cottage in Carmarthenshire and have just had my new , wooden , double glazed sash windows delivered . They have hardwood sills , and were made locally by a very traditional joinery workshop . At -400 each , I think they are far cheaper the uPVC , also are aesthetically and thermally superior , certainly better than the 1980s aluminium that it will replace . One does wonder why anyone would have plastic , you can spot it a mile off , it betrays the character of a building and is quite frankly foul . <p> I have bought a property with uPVC windows in place . Terrible esthetic look and feeling in my Victorian place . So decided to change for timber ones . But of course , moving in already costs a lot of investment and windows are not cheap too . Still I have decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what can be offered . Asked for few quotes around London area and found myself a really good deal . Ca n't be happier , will have my dream house . <p> Hi Heather , A couple of months ago I took the plunge with a company called OakView ? I had n't  heard of it before a friend recommended it to me . Worth a check anyway as I 'm from London as well and I have nothing bad to say about them . Would be good to see who Ruth went with . <p> We inherited warped old uPVC tilt&amp;turn windows most of them nailed shut ( only way previous owners could get them to nearly close , I assume ) . I do like the look of timber windows , and their environmentally friendly materials . We got quotes from 4 companies for timber sash&amp;case ( the houses original windows ) ; uPVC tilt&amp;turn ; uPVC sash&amp;case ; and triple glazed eco-house aluminium &amp; timber windows .

They did an excellent job at a very fair price so would recommend to anyone looking who lives in this area , whether looking for uPVC sash&amp; case or their lovely eco windows . <p> I went for uPVC to replace my sash windows in the home and it has made an enormous difference . The great thing is that you can pull the glazing down so the window goes sideways in the frame which makes it really easy to clean . Not sure you can do that with the wooden models ! <p> I take the points above , but I think for me the biggest thing is keeping the aesthetic feel of the property and for me that makes wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for and against well . 
@@36748834 @5748834/ <h> Should I remove old loft insulation ? <h> February 2 , 2015 <p> We often get asked when a customer is installing loft insulation whether they should get the old insulation removed . We wanted to provide you with a comprehensive answer to this question , so here are the key points ! <h> Is new insulation more efficient ? <p> Generally speaking , if you are installing conventional rock or sheep wool insulation , there will be little difference between the thermal performance of the new and old insulation . Even old newspaper insulation will still keep much of its thermal properties , so unless you need to remove the insulation for other reasons , it is n't worth taking the insulation out for efficiency reasons alone . Further , old loft insulation will not biodegrade when put in landfill , so throwing it away is not very environmentally friendly . <h> -79.99 <p> If you have old paper based loose fill insulation , it may be a fire hazard , and as such you should look at getting it removed . Some people want to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allergic or because they do n't want to breathe in the fibres when they are using the loft . There are clearly reasons why you would want your insulation removed , but efficiency is n't one of them . <h> Can you lay new insulation on top of old ? <p> This is typically the way insulation gets installed . Unless there is good reason to remove the old insulation , the new is simply laid on top . If the old insulation is to joist depth , the new can be laid cross ways , to help reduce the effect of any gaps between the strips of old insulation . <h> Is it dangerous to remove the old insulation ? <p> Fibre glass and rock wool insulation are irritants , and you do n't want to be breathing them in at all . If you are removing the insulation , make sure you have a mask and a hat to keep the fibres out . A change of clothes after installation is also advisable . <p> There is n't really an easy way to remove the insulation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but if you must do it yourself , you will need to hire a skip , as the dustman will not take the insulation away for you . <h> Free insulation schemes and removing loft insulation <p> As you may be aware , there are many free insulation companies out there , and if you are using one of these companies to install your insulation , there are a few things you should be aware of . These companies get paid depending on how much insulation is currently in the loft . If they ask you to remove the current insulation , or indeed offer to do it yourself , they could be committing fraud " as they will make more money when the loft is clear . <p> So the conclusion is , do n't remove loft insulation unless there is a real need to do so " adding insulation on the top will do the job perfectly .

@@36748835 @5748835/ <h> CHP boilers a comprehensive buyers guide <h> September 17 , 2013 <p> The CHP boilers or domestic micro CHP is a new type of boiler available for homes . This guide answers all your burning questions and looks at whether these boilers are a worthwhile investment . <p> Every time we come out of a spell of warm weather and look to heat our homes , we turn to our boilers . Now , there is always that moment of trepidation as I fire up the boiler for the first time as to whether or not the heating system will actually work . Obviously if your system has given you issues in the past or is an older system ( 10 years old or more ) then it may be time for a complete boiler overhaul . <p> If this is the case you will probably be thinking about replacing the old unit with a like-for-like new condensing unit ; however a CHP boiler will provide you with electricity as well as heat , so it may be worth considering . In this blog we look at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mind . <h> What is a CHP boiler ? <p> CHP technology is not a new concept , but in the domestic setting , it is something that has only recently become relevant to UK consumers . <p> We discuss the specific technical aspects of CHP boilers in a bit . Essentially , a CHP boiler will produce your heating requirements just like a normal boiler , but in the process collect the gases to drive an internal generator , creating electricity . The electricity created is then fed back into your property and can power lights and appliances for free as long as enough energy is produced . <h> Are CHP boilers available for homes ? <p> The answer is yes . Up until now CHP has only really been used in commercial applications . However the introduction of the Stirling engine powered micro-CHP boilers has opened this technology up to households . They are suitable for this operation as they are compact and less noisy than other technological solutions . <p> There are internal combustion CHP units that operate more efficiently in terms of combustion to electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when operating , large in size , and more suitable for large buildings and commercial spaces . <p> In addition , fuel cell technology has been used to develop prototypes that may one day become commercialised , but we are probably another 5 years or so from this becoming a viable option . <h> What size of home is suitable for a micro CHP unit ? <p> The most popular micro-CHP boiler available in the UK today is the Baxi Ecogen , and this wall mounted unit is 950mm tall and 450mm wide . This makes it about a third bigger in size than a traditional regular boiler but only marginally bigger than a system or combi boiler . <p> The boiler itself can adjust its heating output to match a heating requirement of 23KW , therefore matching the performance of a regular-sized boiler that would be used to power a 3 bed home . Plus it- will produce electricity at the same time ! <p> The Vitali and Viesmann CHP units are probably more suitable for multi dwelling properties . <h> Financial benefits of a CHP boiler <p> Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tariff. - Check our regularly updated technology pages for current rates of payment . <p> In addition to earning some income through Feed-in Tariff payments , the CHP unit will also produce electricity whenever it is producing heat ( either for heating or hot water ) . Since people tend to have their heating on when they wake up and when they come home in the evenings , the CHP unit will produce electricity to match peak demand requirements . Therefore this obviously reduces the amount of electricity that needs to be purchased from the National Grid . <p> Having said that , the micro-CHP unit will also export electricity when you are not using it in the home . So if you like to leave the heating on at night or during the day when you do n't run lights or appliances , the excess will earn you a few extra pennies . <p> According to the Baxi product specification , their Ecogen product could potentially save -600 off your energy bills per year vs. a G rated boiler ( SEDBUK 65% seasonal efficiency ) and cut carbon dioxide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to remember though that if the boiler is n't turned on , then you will produce zero electricity . <h> Current CHP boiler units on the Market <h> Baxi Ecogen 24/1.0 <p> The Baxi Ecogen has been available in the UK market since 2010 and is an MCS-approved product . The units can now be sourced separately through wholesale companies or specifically ordered and installed with British Gas . The Baxi Ecogen can be powered by both mains gas or LPG . The gas unit retails at c-7,400 ( inclusive of VAT ) and the LPG unit at c-8,000 " this does n't include installation costs , which would have to be undertaken by an MCS accredited installer and a gas safety engineer . <p> On the other hand , British Gas has been readily installing these units since 2011 , so it may be worth giving them a call and finding out if there is a subsidised deal that could potentially bring the cost down . <h> Vitali Energi <p> Vitali Energi on the other hand does n't have an off-the-shelf ' product as what they manufacture is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units are not cheap and would be more suited to large properties and commercial buildings . <h> Viesmann CHP <p> The Vitotwin 300-W is the domestic CHP product developed by Viesamann and currently sold in Germany , but yet to be distributed in the UK . The boiler unit is also a condensing cylinder , allowing it to operate at 96% efficiency . <h> Whispergen Micro CHP <p> At the end of 2012 , E.ON announced a partnership deal with EHE to potentially launch the Whispergen micro CHP unit in the UK . However soon after this announcement , the plans were shelved ( due to the viability of this product for the UK market ) and no further plans to launch this product were put in place . Seasonal efficiency figures for the two prototype units produced are still available on the SEDBUK database , even though the models were never distributed en masse to people 's homes . <h> CHP boilers are they worth it ? <p> Domestic CHP units like the Baxi Ecogen or the Viesmann Vitotwin 300-W are powered by a stirling engine , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiler is working at maximum capacity . <p> In reality this means that the boiler will to some degree help out with electricity consumption during peak load times , for example powering your entertainment system and lights . However as soon as you try and turn on an electricity-guzzling appliance like an oven , tumble dryer or washing machine , the electricity generated will not be enough and the additional requirements will have to be pulled from the grid . <p> Also when there is little heating demand and in the summer , the boiler in theory will not be generating that much electricity . <p> According to Baxi , the incremental cost of an Ecogen vs. a current A-rated condensing unit is -3,000 . However we think this is slightly underestimated as the unit itself currently retails just under -8,000 excluding installation cost ( -8,500 or more including installation cost ) . A new condensing boiler , install plus parts can be sourced for -2,500 , which means that incremental cost is actually over -6,000 with a payback of over 10 years " this means the payback period ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too generous . <p> Verdict : if you already have an A or B " rated condensing unit , then the CHP is just not worth it . If , however , you have a fairly big uninsulated house then the CHP could be an option " however it is not as good as an air source heat pump or a biomass boiler , which benefit- from the Renewable Heat Incentive . <h> Installing a CHP boiler what else do I need to know ? <p> A- few things to bear in mind if you have chosen a CHP boiler : <p> The installation will need to be performed by a qualified MCS installer and a gas safety registered engineer . <p> The installation surface needs to be uninhibited by other objects . <p> The wall needs to be able to support the unit weight and when it is filled with water , which will make it slightly heavier <p> Usually have an electricity generating meter displayed on the unit . <p> Once the unit is installed you need to notify your electricity supplier so they have somewhere to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interested in shortly ! <p> Interested in installing a micro CHP boiler ? 184572 @qwx384572 <p> CHP boilers are designed to work in a power cut , if already on . You would n't be able to initially turn it on during a power cut , however , unless would need some kind of battery storage solution ! If there is no electricity supply , it will not work without a battery pack . <p> James . The money you get for export is trivial especially since with mCHP , you will have burned gas to generate it . e.g. you pay 3.5p/kWh to burn gas at 90% efficiency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The real saving comes when you actually use the electricity generated directly because you save the spark gap amount ( difference between electricity rate and gas rate ) amounting to about 10p/kWh PLUS you get the feed in tariff subsidy of about 13.5p/kWh . This is a total around 23.5p/kWh saving on electricity generated that you use directly . With the Flow deal this combined saving goes to Flow which enables them to guarantee the -80/month bill reduction . If the boiler proves to be reliable it seems a sweet deal . <p> Hi Paul , Time of use tariffs are not in play yet they are a means of forcing people to pay through the nose for electricity at peak times with a view to curbing demand . I.e. 50 / 60 p / kWh at 7pm . This is what I am talking about since then it definitely becomes worth doing . You fire up your CHP boiler to heat your water and you get paid a substantial amount to export it not the 4.77p you mentioned above . <p> Am I right in thinking the Flow Energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could be a win-win situation . Is there a meter to determine how much electricity is put back into the grid . <p> Hi Robert the issue with CHP is that you are only creating minimal electricity since the boiler needs to be firing up to run it . We have also heard to a few people who have tried to get these installed and the conditions are not suitable . I think CHP boilers time will come , but it will be when Time of Use tariffs come into play and you can actually make a decent return from running the boiler at particular times for exporting the electricity back to the grid . If you look at all the big boys , they are yet to venture into the CHP market ( with the exception of a brief showing from Baxi ) so I think that speaks volumes to be honest ! <p> I have just had a quote from Flow Energy for their new mCHP boiler that is brand new . The last blogger correctly identifies that it is -3675 plus fitting of -1742 . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offer and also get 5 year warranty and 4 year service for free .

I live in a remote island situation partly because silence is important , and find the hum from systems Ive experienced here very perceptible . <p> Hi Ros , I lived with a wet underfloor system for 10 years in a remote farm in the Pennines and I did n't  have a problem with the hum . However my boiler ( wood pellet ) was in an outhouse and so was the main heating pump . The heating pump of rate underfloor system was in a corridor within the house . Perhaps you might get hum if the pump is attached to wood rather than stone/brick as wood vibrates 
@@36748838 @5748838/ <h> Triple glazing " Is it worth it ? <h> June 18 , 2013 <h> What is triple glazing ? <p> Put simply , triple glazing is 3 panes of glass instead of 1 or 2 . The claim is that by having an extra pane , you will increase efficiency and reduce noise . We already know that double glazing makes a significant improvement over single glazing , but even so , upgrading from single to double glazing takes a long time to pay back in terms of energy efficiency . So would making the jump to triple glazing make that much of a difference ? <h> Modern double glazing <p> As you may be aware , the energy efficiency of windows is measured with a U-value ' and the lower this value is , the better . <p> Single glazing has a U-value of 5 , older double glazing about 3 and new modern double glazing a U-value of 1.6 , which is mainly due to improved methods of double glazing compared to older models . These improvements have been made through optimisation of the window cavity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas to fill the gap , and using aluminium spacers or cold bridges ' . <p> All this has brought down the U-value of modern windows considerably , so does that make triple glazing worth it , if double glazing is now so much better ? Well , walls have a u value of around 0.3 , so it is clear that windows have a long way to go before they are no longer a weak point in the efficiency of the building . <h> Does installing triple glazing pay ? <p> In Scandinavia , triple glazing is now pretty much standard , with modern triple glazing taking the U-value of the windows down to around 0.8 . This is a considerable improvement on even modern double glazing . Lots of new homes are now being built with triple glazing and it is generally acknowledged as being better , but compared to top double glazing , the payback period is very similar . As we have mentioned elsewhere , on a purely efficiency basis , double-glazing does not pay for itself and triple glazing is no exception . Changing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency payback , is very similar to double glazing payback . <p> Why ? Well the cost of triple glazing is a fair bit higher than double , whilst the improved U-value is not very large . If you are getting your windows done anyway , or you are building a new home , triple glazing is not a bad idea , but if you already have double glazing , triple glazing might not be right for you . <h> Are there other things you can do to reduce your U-value ? <p> Yes . If you are going to have triple glazing , you will need well insulated frames , as this is one of the major heat loss areas in a window . Adding thick curtains , and keeping them closed at night will help reduce your bills also . <h> Other reasons for getting triple glazing <p> So triple glazing does n't really pay for itself , but are there other reasons for getting it above double glazing ? Here I will go through a couple of other reasons why you should consider triple glazing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it is ideal for those living in noisy areas . <p> Double glazing can create cold patches in the house , due to the higher u value of windows compared to walls and doors . This problem is exacerbated by modern insulation " as better and thicker wall insulation means windows become much colder compared to the rest of the house . Triple glazing is an excellent solution to this problem , as it reduces the difference in U-value between the windows and the rest of the building . <h> So triple or double ? <p> The debate over triple or double-glazing is still raging , so I wont tell you one way or another what is best for your property . But there are a few main points : <p> If you want to get rid of cold spots in an otherwise well heated house , or you have lots of noise outside , triple glazing is an option . <h> Installing new windows map . 184568 @qwx384568 <p> Need new windows ? <p> Fill in your details and we 'll be in touch ! 184572 @qwx384572 <p> This page on triple-glazing has a heading reduce condensation which then does not mention let alone deal with that issue . For which you lose points ! I would suggest that you aim for a ( series of ) printable A4 or 2xA4 article which , of course , emphasises your cutting-edge knowledge &amp; skills and how you can help people ! ! <p> Hi there , Thanks for your feedback . The heading you saw is actually a link to another blog post all about how triple glazing can reduce condensation . I have reformatted it so hopefully it looks clearer now ! Were working on a series of printable guides at the moment . <p> There are not many triple glazing review from customers on here so : My home suffers from motorway noise , lots of children playing outside my house ( our front room is facing the road ) . Our house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The noise was a mayor issue and after reading reviews it was confusing if triple glazed would work or would be a viable . <p> Anyway I took a leap into the unknown and went for triple glazed and . its been absolutely amazing . The kids playing were waking my baby and shouting and screaming and its gone .. even when they scream at there loudest , you can barely here it . I went for a 42mm frame to maximise the gap . With the TV on , you cant here anything now ! <p> The heat ! ! ! my g*d who new windows could make such a difference . My home is so warm now , I should of done this along time agomy combi was always on and I cant remember the last time it came on . <p> These windows have truly worked . as its a review the only negative aspect is when the kids are playing footballyou can still here ball its a quiet sound but more of a vibration but they just pass with it . I can only presume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass it vibrates the glass more . <p> Anyway , we had an excellent , one man , fitter and I am sold by the triple glazing ! I hope this helps . <p> Hi Jacqueline , windows companies are notorious for over egging the savings associated with replacing windows . When uPVC double glazed windows first hit the market there were claims that they could have energy bills . In reality this was certainly not the case it sounds like this particular company is making a similar kind of unrealistic claim . While triple glazing is great it is unlikely to reduce the heat loss by 50% compared to double glazing . If you want to get technical with this , a new triple glazed unit will have a u-value of between 0.8 ( for the very best ) all the way up to 1.8 if the glazing panels have no emissivity coatings . A double glazed unit ranges from 2.8 ( when air filled ) down to 1.6 when the double glazed unit is argon filled and both panels have emissivity coatings . So I guess if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the worst double glazed unit the savings would be relatively large . <p> One thing to bear in mind though is that if you insulate a wall with 100mm of EPS ( externally ) or 70mm of Celotex internally you will take the u-value of the wall down to 0.3 or less , and there is substantially more wall than window in most homes , so your money might be better spent looking at that as an energy saving solution rather than replacing the window ! <p> If you make the windows as warm or warmer than the walls will that not cause condensation to form on the walls causing mould and requiring frequent redecorating.In other words are not the windows the sacrificial lamb with excess internal air moisture forming on the coldest surface It has to go somewhere <p> Hi Rod , you are quite right . except that a triple glazed window will have no where near the level of thermal efficiency as a well insulated wall ( where the u-value can be less than 0.25w/m2k ) . Adequate ventilation is always the answer , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows and doors when cooking and potentially when in the bathroom too . <p> Whether it stacks up financially depends on many things : the type of triple glazing , the type of double glazing and the building type , location and heating system . <p> What a misleading question as if it has a single answer . <p> To cap it all , many Scandinavian experts say that triple glazing would not have been introduced in 1978 ( Sweden ) if they had had high performance double glazing with a U value of around 1.1 . However , triple might still be needed if one wants a lower U-value than that . <p> If in doubt , take professional advice . Yes , there are experts who work in this field for a living , including me . <p> this is an interesting discussion , double or triple ? I would agree with the author , go triple if you are building on a new house , but if you still have the double glazed ones and not planning to renovate , why bother . <p> I have just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the result is so pleasing . It replaced anglian double glazing which was 35 years old . during the whole of that period in just moderately cold weather the old windows were dripping in condensation , so much so that we had to place towels on the window sills each night and wipe all the windows every morning . Living on a main road the TG has made it a little quieter but the biggest improvement is in condensation . Most windows almost completely dry ( perhaps 1 ? at bottom ) front door and side frames completely dry but when extremely cold a very fine mist on the bedroom window where we both sleep which quickly clears . The cost was almost the same as quotes for double glazing and I would definitely recommend it . having the back of the house triple glazed next . <p> I have a perfectly simple system . Each winter I apply bubblewrap to most windows . I simply dry the window or frame , cut wrap carefully slightly smaller than the pane ( to tape to pane ) or slightly larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with that nice transparent sellotape stuff , leave until spring . Low investment ( I reuse most of it each year , the sellotape peels off pane and wrap fairly easily sometimes a bit of water helps , and then I put it away for a year in the loft ) . It looks OK , you can even make snowflake patterns if you double the stuff up in the right way , and it seems to be effective . The sellotape gives an adequate seal , the bubblewrap has air pockets , it is very easily cut and fitted to the glass or the frame . I do n't  do the patio door , because I like to look out of it and its gas filled glass etc. which rest is n't . Whole house cost me about -30 for wrap one-off and -2.50 a year for tape , I have re-used packaging bubblewrap. as well , on my 5th year of doing it . <p> Claire what an resourceful lady you are , absolutely fantastic ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Thanks for sharing that wonderful idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after changing a window to open inward instead of outward it became very draughty , as it is winter Ive not been able to fix the problem , so I used bubble wrap to seal and stop the draught until better weather arrives and I can work on it , to my amazement it has made an enormous difference in more ways than one as I also have very thick curtains , I am , personally , in no financial position to afford DG let alone TG , so it is just a perfect solution , I thank you . <p> I am from Finland but living in UK . In Finland triple and even quadruple windows are commonplace . In Scandinavia we have cold winters with temperatures as low as -20 to -30 degrees Celsius below zero . We would freeze to death with single glazed windows ! Astronomic energy bills would be the only result if you would attempt to try to heat a house with single windows during the winter time or as we put it " it is no point to heat for the birds ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make , not only in energy savings but also comfort if you take a trip to Finland , Sweden or Norway during the coldest winter months . <p> I intend to replace all English " double glazed " windows my house in London with proper Scandinavian windows for the sake of the comfort the huge reduction in energy bills is a great plus , and the carbon footprint is indeed massively reduced should it make any difference . <p> For those who suggest triple glazing would not pay off just take a look at the calculation below : For example the best windows on the market in Finland offer U-values of 0.58 ( A++ energy rating ) , E value 30 . Here is what one manufacturer ( Scaala windows ) say ( freely translated ) on their website ; " When we replace the MS-windows from 1950s and install new Alfa Scaala fog-free windows , you can save 10,000 G in 12 years. * * ) Based on the window energy rating E-values . The house of 20m2 square meters of window surface area . Energy price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per year . " <p> Now , in UK triple and quadruple windows appear hugely overpriced , so the calculation might not be accurate for UK . However their calculation shows an energy cost reduction from 11.000 G old windows vs. 1100 G for their best windows over a period of 12 years giving an idea of the how remarkable the energy saving actually is . OK , you might not achieve that but say you reach 70% of that and it is still a pretty good saving in energy costs . But more importantly why freeze inside for 12 years when you could improve the comfort for you and your family ? I got a ridiculous offer from one of the leading UK triple glazing companies ( let us call them " E " for short ) of -27.000 for replacing all the windows and the front door with a 40% discount " applied ? ? ? ! ! ! ) . Even if the frames appeared stiff , I was not convinced of the construction ( insulation ) in the actual frames just looking at the cross-section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way be compared to the standard we Scandinavians are used to . Thus I now intend to import proper double sash quadruple windows from Finland . <p> BUT and here is the " BIG " BUT . If you have a house that is poorly insulated and have typical English construction features such as outer walls brick with no cavity straight chimneys without any flap . ( In Scandinavia we close the chimneys while the fireplaces are n't  in use to prevent heat from escaping along the chimneys which otherwise also causes an awful draft ) . holes as big as a brick in every room for " ventilation " only covered by a grating . <p> Your house might still NOT become much warmer if you have one or more of these brick sized ventilation holes in your house , you need to fix these issues as well ! <p> While ventilation is important to prevent condensation and mold there is absolutely no need to have holes as large as a brick in every single room which appears to be a common practice here in UK . Further it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the inside of the windows caused by cold bridging . <p> Just to make you guys to understand the difference what windows and insulation makes think about the fact that nobody in Scandinavia would use a hot water bottle in their beds No , not even when it is -32 degrees Celsius outside because there is NO NEED for it ! Our houses are properly built , insulated and stay warm even during the coldest winters . <p> Hi Jacob , Thanks for for this comment really interesting , I did n't  know quadruple glazing was even an option ! <p> The issue I guess here in the UK is the price of the replacement windows , a simple hardwood double glazed sash starts at about -1,500 so obviously to replace a whole house worth is very expensive ! Also the UK is considerably warmer than Scandinavia most of the time , so the energy savings are n't  quite as big so the investment is n't quite the same ! However a lot of very interesting points and completely agree , with regards to typical English construction a lot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have missed the biggest point of all namely thermal comfort <p> Once I switched to double glazing , rooms felt so much more pleasant to walk into , and to be in aside from the obvious calm of relative quietness . Also , there 's a considerable increase in comfort from avoiding the battle to heat rooms aggressively , including avoiding the relative delay to get rooms up to temperature . <p> Thanks for the comment Balijeet , agreed this is an often overlooked point . I guess the point is that despite this , the cost of paying for the double / triple glazing means that a pay back in pure energy saving terms is often in the decades ! But agreed thermal comfort is really important especially if there is a particular room in the home you use often . <p> Best test between triple glazed and double glazed windows was at my friends house last winter in Lithuania . At -28 = , one side of the house had double glazing and other side had triple glazing . Triple glazed windows stayed dry on the inside , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per day By the way quality of triple glazed windows made in UK and cold climate countries not the same <p> I am looking to replace 20 year old double glazing . One of the windows is 4.2m wide in my lounge , others are also min of 2m wide ( bathroom ) . I have a window with a broken pane , one window now does not shut nicely and another can be pushed open even when locked down . Because of the size of the windows , I am considering triple glazing . Can anyone give me any info to consider . <p> In response to Paul , I went for a combination of thick curtains and efficient double glazing , and I am very happy it has made a huge difference . If I had to choose again I may opt for triple glazing though as it seems more mainstream now I think Anglian are offering free triple glazing upgrades at the minute . <p> Just wondering how much good thick curtains make to the insulation impact . I pass any number of houses on mid-winter nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " any products out there to collect this rather than my morning bowl and sponge ' ritual ( and I 'm not talking about dehumidifers ) ? <p> Hi Leo you can get triple glazed sash windows , but we would advise against this due to the cost . If you can afford it , double glazed sash windows are still pretty good . Best thing to do is to get 3 independent quotes and then go with the supplier that ticks all your boxes . <p> Had triple glazing installed on a property located in North west London . Honestly , first time ive had piece and quiet and a good night sleep in a while . The company that did the install has helped fit 2 new doors and ive benefited from the green deal -1600 incentive . Not sure if my home is more energy better , but I wait will great patience to see how winter will be . Hopefully positive outcomes . <p> Great debate . In the Modern Double Glazing section , mention is made of " aluminium spacers or cold bridges ' " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synonymous . Modern dgus do indeed have spacer bars separating the two sheets of glass . In a low u-value window , these are specd as warm-edge spacer bars , made of a low conduction plastic . The old-school aluminium spacers are not really known as cold bridges , but will behave as one ; the cold bridge being the aluminium itself conducting heat out through the glass edge . Often condensation will form around the perimeter of the glass partly due to this effect . Decent windows have a thermal break in the frame itself , which coupled with the warm edge spacer , should eliminate this problemp.s . There is a good column on p14 of Historic Scotlands paper , elegantly titled : Fabric Improvements for Energy Efficiency in Traditional Buildings . The relative merits of window improvements are discussed , with values given . <p> Does TG reduce condensation problems ? I would expect that the inner glass layer stays nearer to room temperature in a good TG window , which could reduce condensation . Ive 2 north-facing bedrooms , one double glazed and one single . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single glazed streams with condensation . The double glazed one is better but some condensation still occurs . A high capacity dehumidifier helps a lot but also uses power . Many UK houses have wooden framed windows , so converting to UPVc framed double or triple glazed has an extra benefit less maintenance/painting required . The cost of design and tooling-up a factory for manufacturing windows is similar for single , double and triple glazed . TG adds a little extra cost in raw materials and a fractional increase in production time . The high extra cost of TG has more to do with what the market will bear than actual real manufacturing costs . <p> Hi Mark , you are quite right , the inner pane will be similar to the room temperature so it will reduce condensation further . To be honest though , there is little point replacing working double glazing ( i.e. seal is intact ) with triple glazing since the energy savings just wont be there . You might want to consider it with the single paned window . <p> You are absolutely right with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations go further to make windows on new builds even more efficient ( they are traditionally the weak point in the envelope of the home ) , you would expect to see the prices come down as more manufacturers enter the market and there are increased economies of scale and competition I think ( and hope ! ) this is just a matter of time . <p> What I have also noticed is that prices of triple glazing are often more than double the prices of double glazing . this must be to do with the fact that they do n't  sell as much . Surely the price of triple glazing should only increase by less than a third compared to double glazing . Hardly anyone in the UK builds a house to last nowadays . Only cheap materials are used and often if better insulating materials could be used , that other countries in Europe have been using for decades , that will probably not comply " UK standards " and will not be accepted <p> I live in Sweden in a house built in 1984 . We still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are wooden framed , look like regular windows and we have no problems with hinges or light loss . To us they are just standard windows and we would not consider anything less then triple glazing . <p> As our windows are 30 years old they only have an u-value of about 1,8 but standard windows installed in new houses are now around 1,2 and sometimes as low as 0,8 depending on the gas used between the glass . <p> I do n't  understand why it is such a big deal in the UK to look at other countries building techniques and pick out things that are proven over decades . <p> The UK has a very low-skilled work force ( which is why we typically now employ Indian computer programmers and German Engineers and why we really , really , have a difficult political problem over immigration ! ) Most houses are still built with a labour force that is basically grunt labour using 100-year-old techniques . It is not just housing that is afflicted with this look what happened to our ship-building and car industries . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that our govt policies and focus on banking and london has failed to support engineering and manufacturing and so everything is designed to a minimum to even try to stay in business . Also , we are less arrogant and nationalist compared to most countries and happily buy from all over the world . Were we to stop doing this for say 5 years , the extra cash injection into Uk industries would give the confidence to tool-up for more investment and higher quality levels . Also , you wo n't find many German engineers in the UKit ; s just too inefficient and unpredictable for them , whilst the lack of mixer taps puts most swedes off ! ; o ) Youll also find our best engineers move abroad where they are better rewarded for their skills . <p> No one has mentioned the principle underlying the PassivHaus standard of home insulation and draft-proofing , relevant to any discussion of triple glazing . <p> PassivHaus dictates that the internal surfaces of walls and windows must be no more than 5C lower than the designed air temperature . So if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows must get no colder than 16C to touch . <p> The big deal here , is that this small designed temperature difference reduces the occurrence and perception of cold draughts if you do not suffer a cold draught whilst you are sitting indoors , you can remain feeling comfortable at a lower room temperature if you feel a nasty cold draught it scarcely matters how warm you heat a room , that draught will leave you feeling uncomfortable . <p> Triple glazing gives a good prospect of your windows meeting the passivhaus standard reducing cold draughts of air falling down the face of cold windows you can likely turn the thermostat down 1 or 2C , thus seriously reducing your heating bill , contributing to ROI , and feel more comfortable too . This all assumes that the rest of your house is suitably insulated and draught-proofed ; commonly heat recovery ventilation systems are used in to ensure suitable ventilation without losing heat or creating draughts . Friends house is cool in summer and not over-heated in winter , but feels very comfortable with no draughts the triple glazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite disconcerting given how cold windows normally feel . <p> Its very interesting article and debate . Triple glazing is a very good solution for those living in noisy areas , especially for those people that live in the central parts of the city . It seems new houses are being built right in the busiest parts as a result of a shortage of space , so here it looks like triple glazing is an excellent solution to this problem . Secondly , triple glazing can also be used in rooms where double glazing simply is n't effective . Financially over the long term the triple glazing will give better results than double glazing albeit at a higher install cost . <p> You have to be careful of this . If DG is not effective , why not ? Are you thinking of rooms with three or four external walls ? If so , TG wll help only marginally , because you have not addressed the major sources of heat loss . <p> As for repayment if you pay money for it , then you have to account for the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If TG adds -1000 to your installation , then that is -1000 you would have had on deposit ( or in shares ) . It may be that the reductions in heating costs are less than the loss of interest . TG wont last for ever ; say 10 years before the seals fail . So the costs have to be spread over 10 years ( or whatever the life is ) and be balanced by the savings over that period . In fact , frequently there are no savings , because people do not reduce their thermostat settings , or because the control systems are just not sensitive enough to behave differently . On the other hand , a guaranteed saving occurs if you reduce the thermostat setting by 2 degrees , and you are likely to improve your health as well . On that basis , I would reduce the temp. , save the money and wait for TG to fall in price <p> Triple glazing increases the wright of the opener by at least 50% . For larger windows , the hinges can become twisted due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screws can come away from the frame and result in the sash falling , this could have horrific consequences where the windows are at a high level . In the case of sliding doors , this puts added pressure on the bearings in the track which can eventually seize up . From a carriage point of view , triple glazing takes up twice the space of double glazing on delivery vehicles , so either twice the number of vehicles or journeys are required . High performance double glazing is a far better and safer option although I 'm sure some manufacturers will disagree as triple glazing allows them to sell 50% more glass . <p> I hate to be obvious , but an increase from two to three sheets can not make a frame 50% heavier ; more like a third heavier . Obviously , the internal components will be heavier and perhaps larger , as will be the hinges , but not double the weight . <p> As for hinges failing , are you suggesting that hinges are impossible to design in which case how on Earth do cathedral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just talking about shoddy goods , which would probably fail anyway ? <p> Your argument could be and probably was put forward by installers of single glazing when faced with other companies installing double glazing . <p> Overall , the real argument is not how many lorry journeys take place , but what the energy balance is for the lifetime of the product , including manufacture and distribution . Triple glazing reduces heating requirements , and that reduces green-house gas emission , which is important even if the things otherwise were to be more expensive and less wieldy . But my friends in Prague have triple glazing that is easily 40 years old , and the hinges are just fine , so I think there is a degree here of self-interest . <p> Nick , when measuring rate of change ANY change always divide the new number by the old number . In this case , divide 3 by 2 and you will get a rate of change of 1.5 , in other words a 50% increase . True that the jamb &amp; sash does not increase that much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass . A 50% weight increase is pretty close to what you will be seeing . <p> Triple glazing reduces the light transmission . To obtain the same light level in the room you need a larger rooflight/window , increasing the total heat loss . Therefore triple glazing is a waste of money . The best answer is high performance double glazing . <p> Hi Ray , Thanks for your comment , not entirely sure i agree I think that Triple glazing definitely has a place in homes natural light coming into buildings has proven health benefits so actually allowing for bigger windows is not the end of the world appreciate that the energy savings of increased glazing are lower , but in solid wall properties for instance , where solid wall efficiency is terrible anyway , replacing the large sash windows with triple glazing is actually rather sensible . <p> Do you not think that if the light transmission is reduced and then the window size increased to compensate , you are back where you started with regard to the health effects ? In fact glass blocks various wavelengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to allow you to make Vitamin D from sunlight and you will have to go into the garden . Which is healthier anyway . <p> That leaves the psychological effects of brighter rooms compared with enclosed space , and with that there can be little argument ; enclosure increases depression . <p> Meanwhile , the original point about reducing light intensity is mostly erroneous ; it will be a few percent at most , since the internal sheet in triple glazing will remain clean . A few percent is less than the effect of a little dust on the window and there is always dust or a bit of curtain blocking one corner . In other words , negligible . Would it not have been better to point this out ? <p> The point about solid wall efficiency is a good one , but a bit misleading more effective is to add internal or external insulation , and if you self-fit internal insulation ( not difficult ) it will pay for itself in a few years . Cheaper than fitting larger windows ! <p> Perhaps you might also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window unit is useless if the thing is poorly fitted and leaks draughts around the edges . In fact , that is very common , and poor-quality workmanship undermines a good deal of the expected gains from increases in building standards . For example , sometimes cavity-wall insulation actually in creases heat loss because a poor installation supplies cold bridges . In the real world , actual results are more important than paper gains , and there is little enforcement of building standards .

If you intend to insulate the loft and draught-proof the hatch yourself , it is imperative you take safety seriously . You must take care whenever you work up a ladder and if you feel unsafe or not entirely comfortable undertaking this then please use a certified installer . <p> There tend to be two types of loft hatch : <p> The hatch rests on the frame of the loft entrance . <p> The loft hatch is hinged and will swing down when opened . <p> To draught-proof the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foam strip around the perimeter of the bottom of the loft hatch . When the hatch sits in place , the seal should ensure that all draughts are stopped . <p> If the loft hatch is hinged , you will need to put either the compression seal or the foam strip on the outside perimeter on the top of loft hatch . You will also need to put an equivalent strip on the inside of the hatch frame so that the two strips meet , creating an airtight barrier to stop the draughts . <h> Insulating the top of your loft hatch <p> Once you have insulated your loft space and you have draught-proofed the loft hatch , creating a seal to stop cold air entering the main house and hot air escaping , it is also worth insulating the top of the loft hatch as a final step . <p> This is fairly simple process ; essentially you just need to attach the insulating to the top of the loft hatch .

It has an average tidal range of 8m between low and high tide , while the spring and neap range can be as big as 13.5m . <h> Rance Tidal Power Station and the Tidal Flow <p> When the tide is coming in , the water on the sea side of the barrage is higher than the estuary side ; therefore water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the estuary . When the tide is going out , the exact opposite occurs . As such , the turbines that were installed in the Rance Power Station have the capability to produce power in either direction . <p> The Rance Barrage is 750m long and 13m high , while the actual power generating portion of it is 330m long . This section houses 24 Bulb electricity turbines each rated at 10MW so the maximum capacity of the power station is 240MW . In practice the amount of power it actually produces is about 96MW , supplying approximately 600GWh per year to the grid , which would power approximately 130,000 houses a year <p> One of the major drawbacks about tidal energy- is that it is not a constant source of electricity . There are two tides a day , when the tidal range is at is maximum , and the generating capacity will be at it 's maximum , however there are times when the water level on either side will pretty much be equal , so it will produce no power . <p> The advantage of tidal energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tides are totally predictable , so you can very easily factor this into the energy mix , while other intermittent renewable energy sources such as solar PV- and wind farms are a lot less predictable . <h> Rance Power Station- Cost <p> The Rance Power plant was expensive to build in its day and took about 20 years to actually pay for itself . This is one of the major reasons the proposed -30bn Severn Barrage has not gone ahead , it is simply too expensive to undertake this kind of construction challenge in these tough economical times . However the project is being looked at once again to see if it can be constructed at a lower cost . <p> Since the power plant was constructed though in 1965 , it has produced approximately 27,600GWh of electricity . At today 's prices , that quantity of electricity would cost -3.30bn . <h> Rance Tidal Power Station Environmental Assessment <p> Since the tidal barrage construction needed to drain the estuary in the initial years after the construction was completed , there were severe impacts to the local environment ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estuary once again had a rich diversity of aquatic life . <p> The sluice gates and the lock ( built to allow boats to get through the barrage ) allow a fairly easy transition from one side to the other for all aquatic animals , so this did not have any real affect on species there either . The one impact it did have was that the mud flats were severely diminished so birds that used the mud flats as a hunting ground had to adapt or move elsewhere to feed . <h> Rance Tidal Power Station Final Assessment <p> Upon reflection it must be recognised that building the- Rance Power Plant was quite the engineering feet , and one that perhaps in the- Western world will not be reproduced , not even with new tidal energy solutions . The fact it produces plentiful , 100% clean electricity 46 years after construction and has become a tourist attraction in its own right has proved why it was such a sensible project to start in the first place . <p> Well , the barrage was build in 1966 and consequently we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in this project ( probably many ) . But the main actor was EDF ( one of the big 6 energy companies ) , who supervised the construction and who currently own the barrage .

Other technology giants are also trying to grab a piece of the action such as Google who spent over $3billion acquiring the Nest in January 2014 " so there is obviously a huge future in intelligent heating controls . <h> Smart heating controls cant always control hot water <p> While smart heating controls can definitely help people lower their heating bills , some smart heating controls systems do n't allow you to control the hot water . For those with combi boilers , this is n't a problem since hot water is produced as and when it is required , but if you have a hot water tank this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more and more people are installing unvented cylinders in their homes ( e.g. Megaflo or Joule cylinders ) . These are great in larger properties because they can service many showers / baths at the same time and the pressure produced by this type of system tends to be very good . <p> The problem for those with this type of system ( and for those with the old style vented heat only boilers ) is that hot water tends to be produced and stored until it is needed and smart controls are n't able to control this . <h> The Nest 's inability to schedule hot water <p> If you look at the Nest which is by far the most popular smart heating control system , ( due to the marketing power of Google ! ) , they recommend getting the installer to disable the heating channel of the programmer when they install the Thermostat , but leaving in place the hot water channel " allowing you to still control the hot water with the programmer . <p> The majority of smart heating controls do now allow you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely an exception to the rule , but some manufacturers have produced a work around rather than solved the issue altogether . Take for example the new Heatmiser Smart Stat " if you want to control the hot water with this you need to by an additional thermostat unit ( as if the hot water was an extra zone ) , and instead of using it in thermostat setting , it needs to be programmed to instruct the hot water to come on in timer mode . This means you can still control when the hot water is produced ( i.e. when you forget to turn your hot water off when you go on holiday ) but it does mean you need to shell out on extra kit . <p> As time goes on , the smart heating control manufacturers have built the ability to control hot water feature into their units " the British Gas Hive for example could not do this in the first instance , however the latest release does allow you to produce hot water , however at present this is still a failing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular intelligent heating control , it seems peculiar that it has not yet been integrated into the system , however we think this stems from it originating in the USA " where this is not such a big issue . <p> Hopefully in time the Nest will bring in this functionality , however for now if you are looking to control your hot water as well as your heating from your Smart heating controls then you are going to need to look beyond the Nest unfortunately ! <p> Hi , i had recently boiler and megaflow tank installed with Nest thermostat by a certified engineer . I paid -200 for the thermostat device itself . The biggest problem I found that boiler ( hot water ) starts and Nest does not detect it . Nest shows nothing is on .

I really need advise as soon possible otherwise I am going to mark this thermostat faulty and ask for refund . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when scheduled using the Nest ? it should do because how does your hot water even turn on if not turned on by the Nest Thermostat itself . If you have found that the Hot water turns on unscheduled then this will probably be because the antibacterial mode is turned on , this will heat your tank if it detects that it has not been heated for two . consecutive hours within the last 48hours to prevent bacteria growth in the tank . The nest will not show the hot water as heating at this point but will have an icon showing that bacteria mode is activate ( which is heating ) 
@@36748842 @5748842/ <h> The advantages of sheep wool insulation <h> March 28 , 2014 <p> Insulation is one of the best ways to help increase the energy efficiency of the home . One of the most natural and sustainable ways to insulate your property is to use sheep wool insulation . Most of us are familiar with the woollen jumper , but now you can actually use sheep wool insulation to help keep your home warm in the winter and cooler in the summer ! <p> Now there is no denying you will be paying a premium for the sheep wool , but we have listed 5 features below that should make paying that little bit extra all worth it ! <h> Sheep wool insulation is an outstanding insulator <p> For thousands of years sheep have been able to survive the elements using their wool coats to protect them from extreme cold and heat . Due to the crimped nature of wool fibres , they form millions of tiny air pockets that trap air , helping to provide a thermal barrier . <p> Thermal conductivity is the ability for heat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . It is measured in W/mK , where a lower value signifies a better insulator . <p> Sheep wool insulation has a thermal conductivity of between 0.035 " 0.04 W/mK , where as typical mineral wool has a thermal conductivity of 0.044 W/mK . <h> Sheep wool purifies the air <p> Sheep wool is proven to absorb and neutralise harmful substances " the wool is a natural protein made up of a number of different amino acid chains ( 18 to be exact ! ) of which 60% have a reactive side chain . <p> These reactive areas allow the wool to absorb harmful and odorous substances including Nitrogen Dioxide , Sulphur Dioxide and Formaldehydes and neutralise them through a process known as Chemisorption . <p> So using the sheep wool as insulation actually has health benefits and creates a feel-good indoor climate . <h> Sheep wool regulates humidity <p> Sheep wool can absorb 33% of its weight in moisture without compromising its insulating ability . The core of the sheep wool fibre is hygroscopic , meaning that it will absorb water vapour " making it perfect in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Sheep wool offers outstanding sound insulation <p> Sheep wool offers fantastic acoustic insulation " far better than comparable insulating wool materials . Therefore it is becoming increasingly popular in schools and offices to help aid concentration in the classroom and ensure meetings can be held undisturbed . <h> Sheep wool insulation does not burn <p> A great thing about sheep wool is that it does n't burn ; it is just about the only fibre that naturally resists flaming and as soon as the flame is removed it will actually self-extinguish . <p> As a result of the wool 's high nitrogen content , it will simply smoulder and singe away instead of bursting into flame . In fact you will need to heat the wool to a temperature in excess of 560-C before it burns . <h> Sheep wool does n't itch <p> One of the main reasons why we like sheep wool and recommend it so highly is that it is really easy to work with . Both the glass wool and rock wool cause major irritation if you handle them with bare skin and can cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended that you wear a mask and goggles when installing either of these . However , sheep wool insulation is a breeze to work with as it is safe and harmless lie on the stuff and it would just feel soft and fluffy like a woollen jumper ! <p> We think that the majority of people will want to insulate their own lofts as part of a DIY job , so the fact you can easily handle the sheep wool makes the job far simpler . It is important to stress though , that if you are in any way uncomfortable with trying to insulate your own loft , please get in touch with a professional to carry this job out for you . <h> Sheep wool is sustainable <p> The final point is that sheep wool is 100% natural product - Since sheep naturally produce the wool , it requires a fraction of the energy to produce than man made wool equivalents " with most of this energy required to wash the wool before it is used . <h> FROM -11/m2 <p> In fact , sheep wool requires less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so from a sustainable point of view there is only one winner ! <h> A final point Sheep wool is protected against pests <p> It is not just we humans that like sheep wool , in fact rodents and moths are also pretty keen on the wool too ! However , to allay your fears , all sheep wool insulation we sell is treated to protect it against being eaten . <p> Want to get a free sample of our sheep wool inusulation ? Comfort , Premium or Optimal . Fill in the form below ! <h> 28 comments <p> Well actually James , if you took your Premium sheep wool insulation which has a thermal conductivity of 0.0359 ( which you will obviously know ) and divide that by 0.16 for the current building regulations for lofts , you would get 0.224 . So 224mm a whole 40mm fewer than your comfort . I would bet on your calculations that you would have to go 265mm and round up , instead of rounding downbecause you are n't  technically meeting regulations there ! Just saying <p> Hi James , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to need to use approximately 270mm to reach building regulations . You need to acheive a u-value of 0.16w/m2k . If the sheep wool has a thermal conductivity of 0.042 then you simply divide this by the u-value and it will give you thickness required in metres . So here 0.042 / 0.16 = 0.2625 so 260mm is required . <p> Can you explain about the use of a binder ( normally some sort of polyester ) in sheep wool insulation ? Some manufacturers say it is necessary in order to be able to roll and use it , and to maintain its loft . Others say 100% sheep wool insulation is a better quality product and no binder is necessary . I 'm finding it hard to resolve this conflicting information . Can you help ? <p> We used sheep wool insulation in our home for 3 reasons . 1 . It is a natural insulating product . That glass wool ca n't be good to inhale . 2 . It controls moisture in the loft space . It can absorb a decent proportion of its weight in water with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improves the quality of the air in the home . To be honest the fact it absorbs moisture means less damp ( humidity in home should be less than 30% ) and it also inhibits dust mites from reproducing . You have to accept it will cost more , but the advantages far outweigh the negatives . I have noticed you sell thermafleece in your ecostore . This has plastic interwoven so is not nearly as good as 100% pure sheep wool . Try sheepwool4homes if you are looking for that ! Expensive but works ! <p> I have a cedar shingle roof and thought about getting a company to spray this foam on the underside of my cedar . I am a bit apprehensive after learning that it would cause condensation and rot the cedar if we did not have ventilation . <p> Hi Judy , Absolutely you can although normally Celotex or Kingspan ( or another PIR board ) is used here simply because they have better insulating properties and so will allow even less heat to escape downwards . The sheep wool would still do a grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use sheepwool treated with Thorlan rather than Borax . The thorlan does n't  degrade over time like Borax and so it will last forever and a day ! If you are getting moths in your existing sheep wool it might be worth taking it and speaking to the supplier . It seems peculiar that they were installing Borax coated sheep wool just 5 years ago ! <p> We installed sheeps wook lost insultation in our Listed House in 2010. we are now seeing clothes moths when we have n't seen any before . Ive read that the Borax treatment for the insulation evaporates with age . Getting really concerned now <p> Hi Barry , thanks for your comment ! Yes I imagine Llama wool is a bit harder to come by , but have had a read but apparantly Llama fiber is hollow , making it warm yet light and allowing it to acheive lower u-Values ( warmth/weight ) than wool , which is a solid fibre . <p> Completely agree with your list of advantages of sheep wool . We used sheep wool insulation when we redid our home here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , and we recommend it to all our friends . <p> I used sheep wool in my walls basically to benefit from some of the advantages you listed above . For us it is perfect the number 1 reason though was because it was so nice to handle . This alone made the sheep wool worth it . Useful article though . More people should opt for sustainable insulating materials . <p> I used sheep wool to insulate my whole loft area , it was an absolute treat , except having to remove the old mineral wool first . Regardless of the other benefits , the fact you can handle it without becoming itchy makes it worthwhile . I also like the fact when I go into the loft space now I know I am not breathing in nasty mineral wool filaments that just ca n't be good for anyone ! This is a lovely article though very concise and points out the key benefits very nicely . 
@@36748843 @5748843/ <h> Flywheels as mechanical batteries <p> Flywheel Energy Storage ( FES ) is a relatively new concept that is being used to overcome the limitations of intermittent energy supplies , such as- Solar PV- or- Wind Turbines- that do not produce electricity 24/7 . <p> A flywheel energy storage system can be described as a mechanical battery , in that it does not create electricity , it simply converts and stores the energy as kinetic energy until it is needed . In a matter of seconds , the electricity can be created from the spinning flywheel making it the ideal solution to help regulate supply in the electrical grid . <p> It is based on a really old concept and is very similar to an old-fashioned pottery wheel where the potter moves his feet to make the wheel spin . As the potter works , he removes energy from the system , so to keep the wheel spinning ; he needs to keep moving his feet . <h> So how exactly does it work ? <p> A flywheel is a heavy shaft-mounted rotating disc that speeds up when electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the flywheel is slowed and the kinetic energy is converted back to electrical energy , where it can be transmitted to where it is required . <p> The energy a flywheel contains is a function of the speed that it is spinning multiplied by the moment of inertia . <p> The moment of inertia states that the effective mass of a spinning object is not dependant on how much actual mass the spinning object contains . Instead , it is dependant on where the mass is located in relation to the central point that it is rotating around . <p> For example , if spinning at the same speed , a solid flywheel will store less energy than a flywheel of the same mass that has spokes and its weight situated around the rim of the wheel . <h> A high moment of inertia is good , but speed of rotation is better ! <p> The speed that the flywheel rotates has a larger effect on the energy stored within it compared to the moment of inertia . If you have a flywheel with a rim weighing 1kg and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has the potential to store double the energy . If you take the original flywheel and double the speed at which it spins , you quadruple the potential energy that it can store . <h> Innovation of the flywheel <p> Historically , flywheels have been huge steel structures with the majority of the weight distributed towards the rim of the wheel . However , over the last 30 years , scientific innovation has meant that flywheels can store more energy in less weight and volume , increasing their potential for energy storage . Newer flywheels are made from very strong composite materials and are operated on a bed of near frictionless magnetic bearings housed in a vacuum enclosure . This allows the flywheels to be spun at incredible speeds helping maximise the energy that they can store . In fact NASA scientists have managed to get flywheels to spin in excess of 60,000 revolutions per minute , which is nearly 2.5 times the speed of sound . The amount of kinetic energy that can be stored at this speed makes them ideal for replacing chemical batteries in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a way of prolonging the life of the flywheel energy storage systems . Since there is no friction on a system that is magnetically levitated there will be no wear on the system , so it is thought that these systems could last fifteen years or more as opposed to a chemical battery that may only last five years . <h> Flywheel energy storage in action <p> In June 2011 , the- Beacon Power Corporation- completed the company 's first flywheel energy storage plant in Stephentown , New York at a cost of $60m . The plant utilises 200 flywheels spinning at a maximum speed of 16000 rpm to store excess energy and help regulate the supply to the local grid . <p> On 7th- March 2012 , Rockland Capital acquired the assets of the Beacon Power Corporation and put up funding to develop a second 20 MW flywheel regulation plant in Pennsylvania . <p> Flywheel could be one of the solutions to provide mass scale storage of electricity during excess supply and provide the release of energy during excess demand . <h> 3 comments <p> I truly believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directing a university level study into it . We have developed a program to optimise the size of the flywheels for home , , town and wind farm storage . Do you have any thoughts on the field and armature coil arrangements to optimise the efficiency of the motor and generator ? <p> Hi Alexandre , this looks great . I think energy storage is going to grow into a huge industry , just look what Tesla are doing out in the states ! I know that the main investment is going into battery storage , but the flywheel energy system does look interesting . I think a relatively maintenance free system makes it perfect for homes how much energy can be stored by this football sized design ?

The scheme worked really well , but because it was funded directly by the government , it was deemed not to be cost effective and was subsequently scrapped in favour of ECO and the Green Deal over a year ago . <p> So have we seen the death of completely free boilers under ECO ? <p> When companies are offering a free ' deal , is the boiler really free ? <p> We answer these questions below , and show you how you could benefit from the new ECO / Green Deal scheme . <h> Is ECO the new Warm Front ? <p> The Energy Company Obligation , or ECO as it is more commonly known , is a legal obligation placed on the larger energy suppliers ( British Gas , Npower , E.ON , SSE , etc. ) to deliver energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me this means they are obliged to pay money that will help provide grants towards boilers and loft and cavity wall insulation . <p> One stream of the ECO funding is known as HHCRO ( Home Heating Cost Reduction Obligation ) and is specifically set aside to help vulnerable people get their old boilers replaced . <p> When the scheme launched in early 2013 , there was sufficient funding to cover the entire cost of the boiler install for the majority of homes , hence companies were offering free boiler installs under ECO ' . <p> Since the beginning of 2014 , the market has changed and installers are getting less and less per installation , which means that in most cases they do n't have enough funding to help pay for the boiler outright and therefore customers are being asked to contribute towards the cost of installation . <h> How do they calculate the grant funding for new boilers under ECO ? <p> To explain further , the grant money an installer receives is based on the energy savings made as a result of getting a new boiler installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that is due to be replaced , but the- size of the property and the build type . <p> For example , installing a new boiler in a large 4 bedroom property will result in far higher energy savings than a small 1 bedroom flat . This means there- is a preference to install boilers in larger properties because the installers will get more funding and therefore they do n't have to deal with the difficult situation of asking the customer to contribute . <p> This is why we have seen some customers who live in smaller properties having their free boiler ' installation date announced then cancelled , without any explanation of why they are no longer getting it " the installers have simply moved onto the more profitable jobs . <p> People do n't understand why they get the installation refused whereas a friend or neighbour in another part of town has had the installation absolutely free . <p> This has made a lot of people angry and disappointed and we have certainly spoken to people who have concluded that the ECO free boiler scheme is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process has been unfair up to now ? Absolutely ! <p> Do we think installers and companies promising free ECO boilers should be more upfront with customers how this process works ? Absolutely right ! <h> The changing nature of ECO grant funding <p> The good news is that the government has extended ( Dec 2013 announcement ) the bit of ECO that guarantees a grant for boilers for the most vulnerable members of society right through until 2017 . <p> The bad news is that the grant in most cases will not cover the full install cost of the boiler ; it will however make a significant dent in the amount you need to pay . <p> Perhaps more worryingly , vulnerable customers will still be attached to the whims of the energy companies and these rather complex delivery targets that too few understand . <p> There are certain target figures they need to achieve , and when these targets are reached , the funding will cease or rapidly reduce . Where will this leave the millions of vulnerable customers this scheme is there to help ? <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry regulator ) , you will see that in November 2013 , 73% of the funding for boilers had been used up , and by February 2014 , it was extremely difficult for a new customer to get a boiler under the scheme , simply because the money available was , for all intents and purposes , gone . <p> Bear in mind that the winter just gone was one of mildest winters in a long time " if we have a really cold winter next year , there could be some serious repercussions for those unable to afford a new boiler . <h> How does ECO boiler grant funding work today ? <p> We are now seeing the environment for these grants changing on a weekly basis . <p> For instance , - some installers are able to get something called a fixed rate ' , whereby they receive the same funding for any type of property - ( no matter the size ) as long as the average savings they submit for a group of properties adds up to a certain target figure . <p> This will mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , with some contribution perhaps having to be made depending on the cost of the specific job . <p> Other installers ( as before ) allocate the grant based on the saving made by each property . This means that some properties will get completely free boilers , while others will have to contribute a lot of money or be refused the job . <p> The first method can be very complicated and in the end it may still exclude some people . For example , if the job is complicated ( i.e. the boiler needs to be moved ) then the costs will add-up and the grant will simply not cover the- installation costs . <p> The second method as mentioned before is unfair and many with smaller properties lose out because they will receive very little funding . <h> The future of ECO " combining with the Green Deal ? <p> Update : the Green Deal scheme has now finished . <p> The Green Deal , which is the Government 's flagship energy efficiency scheme and available to all , is designed to reduce the up-front cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates that can be paid back through the electricity bill with the savings you make from the measure . <p> It was actually always intended to work with standalone or side-by-side the ECO grant scheme ( to those that are eligible ) , however recent evidence suggests a lot more work needs to still be done here . <p> For example , in a scenario- where the customer who can get the boiler grant is being asked to pay -1,000 up front towards their new boiler because their ECO grant does not cover the cost , it may be very attractive . <p> The cost of the job is -2,200 for a boiler install where ECO will pay for a hypothetical -1,200 as a grant . The customer can not afford -1,000 , but because the savings made will be substantial , the Green Deal could pay for the difference " assuming the customer is ok to take out the Green Deal Finance loan , paying it back through their electricity bills . <p> In this ideal scenario the customer can get a relatively low cost boiler install that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the schemes . <h> Company websites offering free boilers " is this a scam ? <p> In a landscape where the funding tends to be stretched with more and more middlemen in the market distributing the funding , it suggests the customer will get less and less at the end of it . Our view is that the days of grants covering the cost of completely free boilers are probably gone . <p> The customer needs to be very careful as there are companies out there that ask for money upfront and promise the earth and do n't respond to calls after this has happened . <p> To avoid this , ask the operative some more information . For example the customer will need to be assessed first by a qualified Energy Assessor . They will walk around the property taking various measurements and produce an Energy Performance Certificate ( EPC ) . <p> The assessor will take photographs of the propertys walls , the boiler , windows , loft insulation to work out how much cost the property could save with a new boiler . They will also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualifying benefits . Do n't worry this is quite normal . <p> An assessor may ask for a call out charge , which should be the cost of producing an EPC but no more . This is only to cover their time to make sure you qualify . But this should be no more than -50 -60. - Not -100s , as some companies have been found charging ! <p> The installer of the boilers will have to be a PAS2030 qualified Green Deal Installer " licenced to carry out installations on behalf of this Government backed scheme . Make sure you always ask to see the I 'd of any of these people before inviting them into your property . <h> How can we help you with more information about the grant on boilers ? <p> How do we know about this scheme in such detail ?

I personally find it bewildering . Make no mistake , the individuals missing out on funding for energy saving measures is NOT restricted to " hard working people not on benefits " people who qualify for funding are also missing out ! <p> We get paid on what we save people in Carbon emissions . Typically but not wholly , if a property is particularly small or energy efficient ie : well insulated , double glazed etc its unlikely the funding allocated will cover full cost of the work . Approx 40% of our installations require a contribution of -150--350 . This is mainly because were 3 years into HHCRO and the bigger , more profitable properties were most likely targeted first . <p> Its a shame ( but no surprise ) that the Government have given installation companies the incentive to target the bigger , more inefficient properties rather than those who perhaps need it the most ie : those considered to be in fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On another note . Funding is available under CSCO &amp; CERO for those NOT in receipt of benefits but this funding is restricted to Room in Roof insulation , Cavity Wall &amp; Loft insulation . <p> Although I would stand firmly that this is not a scam , I would do your due-diligence in asking : <p> In addition to the above , I would avoid unknown makes of boiler systems . It may even pay in the long run to make a small contribution and have a Worcester fitted if the company proposes to fit a brand of boiler you have n't heard off only god knows exactly how many ideal isars that were installed under Warmfront grants that require yearly expense in repairs . I would almost guarantee that anyone who got one of these for free has probably paid for it twice in maintenance and repairs .

At Eco GEC Ltd , Inform our customers of the process before we book a survey so not to waste anyones time .

Is this true ? I was under the belief that it was OK as long as I paid the difference . How do I find out more about this ? <p> Hi Angela , firstly you have done well finding anyone who will offer you a new free boiler .

The GDHIF launched earlier this month and is proving quite a success . <p> In cases where there is ECO money left it will be difficult to expect a 100% free boiler and the company providing the service will ask for permission to look at alternatives means to fund it . The alternative could be utilising ECO with Green Deal Finance or with Alternative finance . 
@@36748847 @5748847/ <h> Wind Turbine Components <h> Renewables <h> How does a wind turbine work ? <p> When air hits the wind turbine , the blades spin , converting the wind 's kinetic energy into mechanical energy . This rotary motion then travels down the shaft and drives a generator- where the electricity is produced. - Typically most wind turbines are mounted in the horizontal plane ( like the propeller of a plane ) , and therefore it is key the blades are facing directly into the wind . <p> The yaw angle is the difference in angle between the wind direction and the direction in which the rotors are facing . The aim is to minimise the yaw angle as much as possible , so most residential wind turbines tend to have tails which orientate the turbine to best capture the wind . Wind turbines should therefore be able to rotate 3600- on yaw bearings . <h> The turbine <p> There are 2 main styles of urban wind turbines : <h> Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines ( HAWT ) <p> This is a propeller type rotor mounted on the horizontal axis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aligned with the wind and this is done by either a simple tail , or an active yaw . These are more efficient at producing electricity than VAWTs however they are impacted more by changes in wind direction . <h> Vertical Axis Wind Turbines ( VAWT ) <p> These are aligned in the vertical axis ( like the rotor blades on a helicopter ) . These are only really deployed within urban areas , where the flow of air is more uneven . Due to their alignment , wind direction has little impact on this type of turbine ; however it is apparent that these are less efficient than their HAWT cousins . <p> In addition to HAWTs and VAWTs there are hybrid turbines that are cylindrical ( imagine a gyroscope ) " such as the- energy ball . <p> At- TheGreenAge , we suggest sticking with the HAWTs as they are the more proven technology , and are offered by more suppliers , so you will be able to get better value for money . <p> Most turbines tends to have two or three blades , two bladed turbines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the system , which can lead to increased maintenance further down the line . If you can afford to get a three bladed turbine , we suggest doing so , as these do n't suffer from this problem at all . <h> The tower <p> Three types of tower exist : tilt-up , fixed guyed and free standing . The purpose of these towers is to position the turbines in the best possible position to take advantage of the wind . <p> Tilt-up towers- are held in position by four guy ropes one of which can be released , allowing you to lower the tower , so you can work on the turbine . <p> Fixed guyed towers- are similar to tilt-up towers , except they are permanently fixed in place so you need to climb the tower to do any maintenance . <p> Free standing towers- have no guy ropes . As such they require a very solid foundation . Therefore these are certainly the most expensive , but may well be the most aesthetically pleasing . <h> The inverter <p> Most wind turbines produce AC current , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your home and the grid , however the voltage and frequency of the power produced is very erratic , so an inverter is used to convert the erratic AC to DC , then back to a smoother AC which can be synchronised with the grid , or for use directly into your home . Battery-based wind turbines normally operate at 12 or 48 Volts , and therefore the inverter must also act to convert this relatively low voltage to high voltage ( UK mains is 240 volts ) . Battery-less systems may produce electricity with a voltage significantly higher ( 100 volts or more ) . Therefore in this situation , the inverter needs to be able to handle this higher voltage . <h> Batteries <p> In most wind turbine systems , the electricity does not power any appliances directly . Instead the electricity produced is stored in deep-cycle lead acid batteries which look very similar to the ones found in most cars today ( although structurally different ) . The two most popular types of battery are GEL and Absorbed Glass Mat ( AGM ) , which store the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the common lead acid ( wet cell ) battery . Both types of- batteries are designed to gradually discharge slowly and recharge 80% of their capacity hundreds of times . <p> An automotive battery is a shallow-cycle battery , and this is designed to discharge only about 20% of its electricity so is unsuitable for- solar photovoltaic cell- set-up . The reason is that if any more than 20% is drawn more than a few dozen times , it will get damaged and no longer take charge . <p> Wind turbine batteries tend to operate at 12v , and can be arranged in banks ( multiple batteries ) , increasing the storage potential of your wind system set up . A bank of batteries organised in a series increases the capacity of your storage but also increases the voltage delivered from your bank ; while multiple batteries organised in a parallel circuit increase the capacity , but the voltage stays the same . <h> Charge controllers <p> Charge controllers are used in wind turbine systems to prevent the batteries from being overcharged . If you decide to implement a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as any excess electricity that you do n't use at any particular moment is sold directly back to the grid . However , for any battery setup , a charge controller is necessary as it prevents damage to the battery by monitoring the flow of electricity in and out . If your system overcharges the battery it will damage it . The same is also true if you completely discharge all the charge held within the battery . <p> Most charge controllers associated with wind turbines have dump load capability associated with them . This allows any additional charge to be diverted from the batteries when they are full , potentially to a hot water heating system ( so the electricity is not completely wasted ) . Obviously if you are connected to the grid , this electricity would instead be sold there , providing you with an additional income stream . <p> Most charge controllers are also equipped with maximum power point ( MPPT ) charging. - The principle of MPPT is to extract the maximum available power from the wind turbine by making them operate at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voltage ) . The algorithm included in the MPPT charge controller compares the output from the wind turbine with the battery voltage and then fixes it at the best charging voltage , to get the maximum charge into the battery . <h> Safety equipment- - - <p> Disconnects are simply switches that allow you to isolate parts of the system so you can troubleshoot or repair faulty parts without the risk of being electrocuted . In addition many wind turbine systems are grounded , so that if there is surge in current anywhere in the system it is safely dissipated rather than damaging the system or more importantly you ! <h> Installing a wind turbine <p> Are you thinking about local installer to help install a wind turbine at home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in touch shortly ! <p> Interested in getting a wind turbine installed ? 184572 @qwx384572 
@@36748848 @5748848/ <h> 5 reasons to install an EV home charging point <h> July 20 , 2017 <p> Electric cars have several benefits . They 're far better for the planet , they are cheap to run , and they rarely need maintenance.But sometimes there is an idea that they are inconvenient to run , which puts people off . In fact , there 's nothing particularly difficult about it . There are a few options when charging an electric car . You can charge it from the mains using an extension lead , you can do- it at a public charging point , or you can install a home charging point. - Here , we are going to run you through why having a charger at home is a good idea . You 'll still have to use public charging points on long journeys , but day-to-day , its cheaper and easier to have your own . <h> Home EV charging points are cheaper <p> Youll have to cover the installation costs yourself , but the OLEV grant gives you- 75% of the cost of the charger , up to a maximum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charging costs will be much cheaper . The cost of home charging will vary depending on the model of car and your electricity tariff , but a full charge might cost as little as -3 meaning your car could cost as little as 2p per mile to run. - You will just pay your- normal electricity unit price , rather than -1-1.50 an hour for charging in public ( or up to -7.50 an hour for rapid charging ) . <p> If you 're on Economy 7 or a time of use tariff , you could save even more money by charging your car with cheap off-peak electricity . <h> Home EV charging points are faster <p> Depending on its size , a home electric charging point can charge your car from flat to full in anywhere between 1 and 7 hours . This is definitely quicker than charging from the mains , which takes a minimum of six hours . Its also quicker than public charging , unless you use a rapid charging point but these are n't  cheap . <h> Home EV charging points are more convenient <p> Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charging point gives you absolute control over when you charge your car . Charging points can be hard to come by in some areas of the UK , and if you 're not first in line , you could easily find yourself hanging around waiting for the person in front to finish charging. - At home , you can just plug it in and carry on with whatever you want to do ! - As most electric cars have a range of 200-300 miles , home charging will be enough for everyday use , meaning you 'll only have to top it up at public charging stations on long journeys . <h> Home EV charging points may be- better for battery life <p> An electric- car battery is no different to other batteries charging it over and over will eventually affect how well it can hold its charge , and its efficiency will be reduced. - Charging it to near full when possible , rather than just for an hour or two , might be better for it in the long run and this will be easier to do if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can improve property value <p> There are almost 100,000 electric car owners in the UK at the time of writing May 2017 and as- more and more people opt to go electric , an electric car charging point can be an attractive addition for would-be buyers . <p> Most chargers are pretty discreet- and also easy to uninstall/relocate if- need be . <h> From -470.00 <h> Installing an EV charging point <p> Interested in having shortly ! <p> Interested in having a home EV charging point installed ? 184572 @qwx384572 184569 @qwx384569 184566 @qwx384566 <h> What are the potential problems with air source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source heat pumps are a popular way to heat your home off-grid . They are efficient , take up little space , and can heat your hot water as well . So , what are some of the pitfalls and problems that come with an ASHP installation ? <h> Quality of ASHP unit <p> Just like with boilers , there are good quality units and there are bad quality units . ASHPs can be quite expensive , and that can lead the consumer to go for a lower-quality product . Furthermore , because the market is- fairly new and people do n't  necessarily know the best brand names , it is easier to fool the customer into thinking they are getting a good quality system when perhaps they are not . <p> Low-quality ASHP units can come with plenty of problems . They tend to have smaller heat exchangers more liable to freezing in British winters . This can lower the efficiency of the heat pump as it tries to defrost itself . Better quality units designed for the British market have larger heat exchangers which are designed to avoid- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <h> Siting the heat pump <p> The heat pump needs to be sited in the right spot . If sited incorrectly , the efficiency will likely be much lower , as the air that is released from the heat pump is drawn back in the other side . The other thing is noise they are n't that bad , but we have heard stories of neighbours taking issue with them , so do yourself a favour and keep them happy . Make sure the pump is sited away from your neighbours house just in case . <h> Quality of installer <p> Being a relatively new technology , there are plenty of cowboys out there who do n't know what they are doing . Make sure you use only MCS-accredited installers for this kind of work , and do your due diligence to ensure the installer has good feedback from other customers . <h> Inappropriate property for ASHP <p> You can have a perfectly installed heat pump , but if the property is draughty and poorly insulated , the heat pump is never going to get the property up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and radiators sufficiently sized . This is something that an installer should check as part of the initial survey , but make sure that this is checked one way or another ! <p> Its also very easy to get suckered into getting a heat pump when your property is on the gas grid and it would actually be cheaper to run off a gas boiler . Even though heat pumps are one of the most efficient ways to heat with electricity , they are still more expensive than using a gas boiler . This is because the price of gas is around 3-4 times cheaper than electricity , and any efficiency gains from the heat pump will not- be enough to compete with the low cost of gas . We only usually recommend heat pumps for those off the gas grid . <h> Claim your RHI <p> For those who are aware of the Renewable Heat Incentive , this part is obvious . Unfortunately , there are people installing heat pumps that are not aware of the scheme and leave it too late to claim , or have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore ineligible . Do n't make this mistake as it could cost you several thousand pounds . Once installed , you have 12 months to apply for the RHI , or you will miss out . 184563 @qwx384563 184570 @qwx384570 184567 @qwx384567 184575 @qwx384575 184577 @qwx384577 184572 @qwx384572 184573 @qwx384573 184566 @qwx384566 <h> Have you got a cold conservatory ? here 's how you can fix it ! <h> July 13 , 2017 <p> A conservatory can be a great addition to your home , but it can also bring problems . It can be difficult to know how to heat it , and the fact it is built from glass means it does n't  retain heat well. - Aside from being expensive for your bills , and potentially attracting damp , it is pretty frustrating not to be able to sit comfortably in a part of your own home . Too cold in the winter , too hot in the summer ; it can be really difficult to reach a balance . <p> Obviously , glass is nothing like as good at insulating as solid walls , so hot air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold air can get in from outside . To be honest , although you can limit it by opting for double-glazed glass , some degree of heat loss will always be inevitable with a conservatory . There are things you can do to offset some of the problems though ; were going to run you through a couple here . <h> Insulate your conservatory ceiling <p> A modern method of increasing the energy efficiency of your conservatory is to attach insulation to the inside of the roof . Clearly , you will lose some of the natural light entering your conservatory , but it will still come through the walls , and you will be able to create a more comfortable environment . Insulating drastically reduces the amount of heat that can pass through a surface , and because heat rises , ceiling insulation is a measure that can make a real difference . As well as keeping your conservatory warmer in the winter months , it will also stop some of the thermal gain from sunlight hitting your roof in the summer , meaning the room will not overheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> First , battens are fixed to the inside of the roof . Quilted foil insulation is then added between battens , and more battens are attached on top of this . Finally , it is all covered with plasterboard and skimmed with plaster , to create a smooth surface for painting. - Ventilation must be added to ensure the insulation does n't  encourage damp , by allowing condensation to collect between surfaces . <p> Its a relatively cheap and quick process , and wont cause much disruption to the household . <p> The insulation works as a barrier to prevent heat rising through the glass ceiling . In fact , the measure can reduce heat loss from the conservatory from 90% to as little as 10%. - It also stops sunlight causing the room to overheat . <p> For help finding a local installer for the measure , fill in the contact form at the bottom of the page . <h> Install infrared heating <p> The main issue with conservatories is that their temperature is badly affected by draughts . Normal convection heating ( i.e. radiators ) heats the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conservatories . Because infrared heats via ( safe ) radiation instead , its easier to reach a certain temperature and maintain it . Infrared heat rays heat the fabric of the building , and its contents , directly . <h> From -419.99 <p> Herschels Aspect heater is a great option . Its a stylish and discreet bar heater that can be placed on the wall and will direct heat down and outwards , heating the floor , the furniture and you ! This thermal mass will then stay warm and continue to radiate heat , even after the heaters are turned off . You will feel radiant heat even if draughts enter the conservatory , because infrared is a completely different , more direct form of heating . You can also get portable infrared heaters for extra boosts of heat when sitting there on a cold day . <p> It goes without saying that your conservatory will never be the warmest room in your home , but if you want to heat it , infrared definitely makes the most sense . <p> Interested in having your conservatory insulated ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are kiloWatt-hours and what is the cost per mile of an electric car ? <h> July 11 , 2017 <p> Prices correct as of July 2017 <p> When you 're thinking about buying an electric car , you 'll hear lots of technical terms bandied around . You may get told , for instance , that a car will cost a certain amount to run per kiloWatt-hour . This might not mean much to you or me ! What does it mean in real terms ? <h> What is a kWh ? <p> A kiloWatt-hour is the most common unit for measuring electricity usage . Watts have- been used for a long time to measure the electricity requirement of lights and appliances , and the kWh ( 1000Watts ) is now used to measure the efficiency of electric car models . Roughly speaking , the cost per kWh in an electric car is the equivalent of what you pay per litre for petrol or diesel at the pumps with a normal car . In- practical terms , the way to explain the cost of kiloWatt-hours used by electric cars goes something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pay for one hour of electricity from the National Grid . The average price per unit ( kWh ) is 12.5p , but it depends on your tariff and provider . <p> The second is the size of your cars battery in kWh . The larger the capacity of your electric cars battery ( in kWh ) , the further it will be able to go before recharging . But it will take longer to charge in the first place ! <h> So how much does it cost to charge an electric car ? <p> To work out- the charging costs of an electric car , simply multiply the cost of electricity per unit- ( kWh ) by the battery capacity of the model in kW . <p> Let 's take the example of a standard single-rate electricity tariff and a mid-range electric car ( Renault Zoe ) : <p> 12p x 41kWh = 492 <p> This means a total home charging cost ( to full battery capacity ) of -4.92 . <h> How does this cost per kWh compare to cost per litre for a normal petrol car ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of petrol per litre- and multiply it by the size of the fuel tank in this case , we have taken the example of a 45l Renault Clio . <p> -1.19 x 45l = -53.55 <p> So a full tank of petrol will cost you -50 , but a full charge of an electric battery will cost a fiver . <p> Its worth saying at this point that you cant really compare like-for-like , as the range ( i.e. how far a car will get before requiring re-fuelling/recharging ) is different for petrol and electric cars . The majority of petrol cars have a range of around 2-3 times that of an electric car . Costs per mile are difficult to estimate because of the wide number of variables that affect them . Clearly , how long exactly this 41kWh lasts/how far it gets you depends on your driving speed and the load of the car , among other things . So the real-life range will be different from the one specified by the manufacturer . This aside , - there is still a big difference in the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out far cheaper per mile . <h> Cost per mile of electric cars <p> To work out the cost per mile to run an electric car , you divide the cost of charging per mile by the range of the car . If we round up the -4.92 charging cost for the Renault Zoe above , and use the manufacturers specified range ( 250 miles ) , we get : <p> 5/250 = 0.2p per mile . <p> Compare this to the cost per mile of the petrol car above ( more than -1 ) and you can see why electric cars are known for their efficiency ! <p> As mentioned above , real costs would probably be slightly higher , because this range assumes full efficiency , but hopefully we 've explained why electric cars are a cheap option , at least in terms of running costs . These could be reduced even further if the battery was charged at- off-peak times with an Economy 7 or time of use tariff. - The cheapest way to charge an electric car is at home , and the easiest way of doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Installing an electric car- charging point <p> Interested in having shortly ! <p> Interested in having a home EV charging point installed ? 184572 @qwx384572 184569 @qwx384569 184566 @qwx384566 <h> Can I get an air source heat pump if I live on the coast ? <h> July 6 , 2017 <p> A few people have asked us- whether it is possible to have an air source heat pump if they live- near the coast . This might seem an odd question at first , but there are good reasons to be- careful when considering getting an air source heat pump on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumps are a great way to heat an off-grid property . They are usually cheaper to run than an oil boiler or electric heating , plus you will receive government Renewable Heat Incentive payments . <p> Normally , you wont have any problems running a heat pump , but if you live by the coast , you need to be aware that an air source heat pump is particularly vulnerable to corrosion from the salty air . Any property within 4 miles of the coast should be aware of this issue and your installer should be informing you and letting you know your options . <h> Avoiding corrosion with coastal heat pumps <p> Whilst corrosion can be a real issue for coastal heat pumps , there is a solution . There are protective coatings that can be applied to the heat pump to avoid corrosion . These are applied at the time of installation and may need touching up over the life of the unit . This is a simple and effective way to avoid expensive repairs and ensure the longevity of the heat pump unit . <h> Sizing coastal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more exposed , and so the heat pump will usually need to be sized slightly larger to accommodate the additional heat loss associated with the location . This is not a reason to avoid having a heat pump , but it is important that the system is sized correctly as an undersized pump will not get your home up to temperature . <h> Locating your heat pump <p> The location of your heat pump is really important . This is true for any heat pump , whether on the coast or inland , but we feel it is important to emphasise . Heat pumps need to be away from walls and fences , and need to allow good air flow around them . If this is not the case , air can leave the unit and go back into the intake . This lowers efficiency and is therefore something you 'll want to avoid . <h> Getting a heat pump on the coast <p> If you are worried about the lifespan of an air source heat pump in your locality , it might be a good idea to look at alternatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source heat pumps take their heat from the ground rather than the air , there is no danger of corrosion . Biomass is also a possibility in more remote locations outside of cities where air quality regulations are less strict and more space is available . 184563 @qwx384563 184570 @qwx384570 184567 @qwx384567 184575 @qwx384575 184577 @qwx384577 184572 @qwx384572 184573 @qwx384573 184566 @qwx384566 <h> Volvo announce switch to electric cars <h> July 5 , 2017 <p> Great news this morning " Volvo have announced that from 2019 onwards they will not be making any cars that solely run on internal combustion engines ( normally petrol or diesel ) .

The benefits of electric cars are becoming more widely known , and the market will only increase. - A quarter of UK carbon emissions- are from road transport , petrol and diesel cars are increasingly unpopular since the VW emissions scandal . Manufacturers and potential buyers are currently supported by generous government grants to help EU countries reach ambitious carbon reduction targets for tackling climate change and urban air pollution . <p> This announcement also comes on the back of battery prices dropping dramatically ( as a result of mass production ) and it seems the fabled $100/kWh price is only months away ! <p> Where once electric cars were a gimmick , they are now an attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mean for the petrol car market ? <p> Volvo estimate that by 2025 they will have sold 1m electrified cars ( either hybrid or full electric ) .

More people know them by their common name : the air conditioning unit . In the UK , they are more often found in offices than in the home , but they are becoming more popular for domestic properties , particularly in new builds . The difference with modern heat pumps is that they can actually heat a property , as well as cool- it . <p> The unit works by taking in heat from the outside air . This heat is amplified using a compressor and then released into the home . With an air to water heat pump , the heat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through radiators or underfloor heating . With- air to air heat pumps , warm air is emitted directly from the unit . <p> Of course , with an air to air heat pump , you will need to have ducting around the house to allow the air to circulate . With an air to water system , a conventional radiator or underfloor system will be required . <h> Are air to air heat pumps good for domestic properties ? <p> Air to air heat pumps are a very efficient way to heat a property . That is why many larger commercial buildings will use a heat pump with integrated ducting to condition a property . They also have the added advantage of being able to cool during the summer and heat during the winter , where central heating systems do not . <p> Air to air is often not practical for domestic properties because of the additional ducting required , but for a large scale retrofit or new build , it could be a viable option . Using warm air to heat a home is actually really efficient and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must remember that whilst air to air heat pumps are pretty efficient , they are usually more expensive to run than a gas central heating system because of the relative price of gas to electricity . We usually recommend sticking with gas central heating if that is available where you live , if cost is the major consideration . <p> One more thing to remember is that an air to air heat pump will not heat your hot water , whereas an air to water pump can be used to help heat your hot water too . This can save money because immersion heating of hot water is very expensive . <h> How much do air to air heat pumps cost ? <p> Because central heating is not required , air to air heat pumps will actually cost less to install than an air to water equivalent . The more difficult part of the installation is working out how to include the ducting , as this is not normally considered in a home heating installation . Depending on the size of the property , you will likely be looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of the ducting . <h> Are there any grants for heat pumps ? <p> The governments Renewable Heat Incentive is available for air to water and ground source heat pumps , but not available for air to air pumps . The RHI pays out a few thousand pounds over 7 years following the installation of an air to water heat pump , so it may be worth going for this option once you have crunched the numbers . <p> There are currently no government grants available for air to air pumps . <h> Air to air vs. air to water heat pumps <p> As we have touched on , there are a couple of factors you need to consider when deciding between the two , so we have made a list of pros and cons for you to help decide : <h> Air to air <p> Cheaper to install than air to water , dependent on the cost of ducting . <p> Provides excellent conditioning of rooms and heats quicker than radiators <p> Can also be sued to cool property as well as heat . <h> Air to water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook up to existing radiators or underfloor in most cases <p> Can heat your hot water as well as central heating <p> So we hope this has helped you work out what is right for your property .

A qualified assessor visits your property and- looks at every- aspect of the building and the systems within it and gives it a rating from A-G , with A being the most efficient property possible . The survey can be done in as little as an hour , and afterwards you can- be sent a personalised recommendations report , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the property . This considers things- like the heating system and how much insulation the property has , and how installing or updating them could improve your rating . <p> EPCs can be split into two categories domestic and commercial and its a legal requirement to have an EPC of a certain rating if you are renting out a property ; but more and more people are choosing to get an EPC on their own home . Let us explain why ! <h> Commercial EPC <p> Getting an- EPC every ten years has been a legal requirement for every rented property since 2007 , but stricter guidelines have recently been brought in. - The new Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards ( MEES ) require your property to have a rating of E or above on your EPC . If not , the- landlord will not be allowed to let the property , and will be liable to pay a fine of up to -150,000 . Ensuring properties are not hugely inefficient has two benefits : ensuring some level of protection for tenants against high energy bills , and reducing carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to take EPC ratings into consideration . A more energy efficient property means cheaper bills for those living in the property , - and happy tenants are more likely to pay their rent on time ! It also means- less work for property developers if you ever come to sell . Therefore , if you 're looking to sell or rent out your property , its worthwhile making sure it has the- best chance of a good rating . All potential tenants and buyers- are legally entitled to see this information before making any decisions . <h> Domestic EPC <p> Although not required by law , getting a domestic EPC is a great way to get to grips with how you could make your home more efficient . Knowing the best ways to improve your homes energy efficiency can be a bit alienating for the ordinary homeowner , so its useful to have a guide of what to think about. - If you make the changes suggested ( some of which , like insulation , are fairly cheap ) , you could find it cuts your bills significantly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic EPC normally only costs around -50 and the benefits are clear cheaper energy bills , a warmer home and the knowledge that you are reducing your carbon footprint ! <h> Getting an EPC <p> Need an EPC ?

The national rollout scheme originally intended to be completed in 2020 is now encountering more problems , with fears that rising costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rollout delayed <p> The rate of installations needs to increase , as its been much slower than first hoped. - Up to 7 million smart meters have been installed to date in the UK , of the 53 million originally intended by 2020. - The cost to suppliers of rolling out the scheme is rising , as many customers have been harder to persuade than expected . <p> Due to a lack of clear advice , a lot of people fail to see the benefits of having a smart meter installed especially as it basically means taking a day off work . Scaremongering has n't  helped , with theories circulating about ulterior motives for collecting customers usage information ! - Momentum has also been halted by serious technical issues , as some peoples meters have stopped working after switching supplier , despite repeated assurances otherwise . <h> Rising costs of smart meters <p> There has been a lot of criticism that the scheme has been badly run and suggestions it should be be paused and reconsidered , before costs spiral further . The cost per household of having a smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative costs from chasing hard-to-reach customers . Although householders wo n't shoulder the whole cost of installation , a fraction will be passed on to them via their energy bills exactly how much- remains to be seen . <p> The increased cost per household has been blamed in part for the big six energy companies recently rising bills . If bill payers end up shouldering higher costs for installation , it will contradict promises made by the government , further fueling- mistrust . <h> What 's next for smart meters ? <p> The government included its commitment to smart meters in the Queens Speech to Parliament . There was a veiled admission of defeat in the subtle change of wording used ; there 's now only a promise to offer a smart meter to every household by 2020 . This buys them more time to ( hopefully ) iron out all the problems Something that might worry some people is the fact that the Queens Speech also mentioned the possibility of smart meter regulations being changed in the future . <p> Many already have fears over how data will be stored and used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  collect any more data than ordinary meters , and energy companies cant share it unless you give them explicit permission . <p> Importantly , no-one will be forced to have a smart meter installed but there is still a lot of hope for their benefits , provided current issues are resolved . Proponents say that the positives of smart meters will mean they pay for themselves in the future , but in order for the benefits to be realised , the majority of UK residents need to be persuaded to co-operate . The government and energy companies have a lot to do to reassure people and encourage them that getting a smart meter is in their best interests . <p> Have you had a smart meter installed ? Do you think they are a good thing , or an expensive mistake for the UK ? - <h> What to think about when installing solar panels <p> Solar panels are a popular choice for those wanting to generate their own electricity . They 're relatively quick to install , easy to maintain , and can save you money while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider when thinking about installing them , though " we are going to run you through some of these . <p> The three main things to think about : <p> The roof you install the solar PV system on should ideally face between south-east and south-west . <p> The inverter ( which changes the direct current generated into alternating current to be used by domestic appliances ) should be placed close to the PV panels , to minimise transmission losses . <p> The roof should not be prone to overshading from trees or other buildings . <h> Placement/angle <p> Be careful about the placement of your panels . Although solar PV panels are at their most efficient when facing south , they will still generate some electricity in other generations but not as much . It 's worth taking this into account when thinking about whether or not your home is suitable . North-facing orientations should be avoided . <p> The angle of the panels is also really important . A mid-point between horizontal and vertical " such as a typical UK house roof at around 32- will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , so the minimum tilt you need to allow rain to wash away dust is 15- off horizontal . If your array will be facing east or west , a shallower tilt angle will work better , as the sun is lower in the sky as it moves away from due south . If you have a flat roof , you can mount panels on frames and angle them where they will get the best yield possible . <p> You can get an automatic- solar tracker , which moves your panels to make sure they are always facing the sun . However , these are more expensive and do n't  perform as well as their stationary counterparts in harsh weather conditions . <h> Shadowing <p> Shadows have a big impact on the performance of solar panels . If your panels are even slightly shaded by large trees or nearby buildings , they will not work as effectively . This is because solar panels are connected into strings and even- if only one cell in a string is blocked , the output of the other panels in the string drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheat this to a certain extent by arranging modules so that shadows will affect one whole string if possible , rather than the end cell of multiple strings . <h> Inverter <p> Solar panels produce electricity in direct current ( DC ) , which needs to be converted into alternating current ( AC ) before it can be used in the home . Systems include an inverter for this reason , and to work at maximum efficiency , it should be installed as close to the panels as possible . Most choose to place it in the loft.The placement of your diverter is also important if you are hoping to claim Feed in Tariff payments . <p> It 's well worth doing your research to find a good solar PV installer , as they 'll know- all the above and will be able to ensure that it is taken into account . <h> Optional extras for maximum efficiency <h> Solar PV diverter <p> Installing a solar PV diverter will make sure you maximise savings on your bills , by allowing you to use as much of your self-generated electricity as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels that is not used straight away is sent to the National Grid , and you 'll have to pay to import electricity like anyone else- at times when the sun is n't shining . If you install a diverter , it sends surplus electricity you do n't  use to your immersion heater , meaning you 'll save money on water heating . <h> Solar PV battery storage <p> You could even go one further and install a solar battery storage system although itll cost you . This allows you to store the electricity you generate , to be used whenever you want it , leaving you less reliant on national energy stores , and cutting your bills even further- as a result . <h> Installing solar PV <p> Are you thinking about installing shortly ! <p> Interested in getting a solar PV system installed ? 184572 @qwx384572

With so many products on the market , it is important to select one that will provide you with the best outcome for your specific requirements . <p> The first thing to assess when considering whether to draught-proof your floorboards is what the required finish is . For example the methods used to draught-proof floorboards under a carpet are different to those used to draught-proof stripped floorboards . It should be noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not 100% effective , and additional measures can still help . <h> How do I draught-proof stripped floorboards ? <p> There are many products that fill the gaps between the floorboards , helping to prevent draughts . These come in the form of tube-like rolls ( such as DraughtEx ) that are easily pushed into the spaces between floorboards , assuming- that the correct and accurate diameters have previously been taken into account . This is a quick , easy and relatively cheap way of draught-proofing your floorboards effectively . However , difficulties may arise if you have an older floor with uneven gaps between the floorboards that may require you to buy additional rolls of different sizes . <p> Alternatives to the tube-like rolls , which are pushed into floorboard gaps , are thin V-shaped , one-size-fits-all , plastic lengths that spring apart when pushed into place using a credit card .

@@36748850 @5748850/ <h> Buying a house with solar panels <h> October 26 , 2015 <p> Well over 500,000 properties in the UK now have solar panels installed on their roofs " this equates to approximately 2% of the 28,000,000 homes here in the UK . <p> There is therefore a reasonable chance that if you are in the market to buy a new property you will come across properties that already have solar panels installed . In this article we want to look at some of the questions you need to ask yourself before buying a house with an existing solar system . <h> Question 1 " how big is the solar system ? <p> Firstly how big is the solar system " this can be calculated very easily by counting the number of panels . On the whole most solar panels are 250 watts each so if you had 4 panels you would have a 1kW ( 1000 watts ) system and if there were 14 panels , then you would have a 3.5kW system ( 3500 watts ) . <p> This should give you an idea of how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your new solar system and therefore how much you can use in the house . <p> If you count the panels and multiply the size by 90% this will give you a very approximate number of kWh you will produce . A kWh is a unit of electricity " this is what most of us buy from the grid and depending on your energy supplier this could cost anywhere between 10-15 pence . Take for example a system with 10 solar panels on the roof : <p> 10 panels x 250 watts each = 2500watts ( also known as 2.5kW ) . <p> 2500 watts x 90% = 2250 kWh <p> 2250 kWh x 10p = -225 worth of electricity is being produced by your solar panels <p> Now you just need to find a way to use it ! <h> Question 2 " who installed the solar panels ? <p> Ask the existing homeowner who installed the solar panels " this is important for a few reasons , firstly you can find out if they were MCS approved . The lack of MCS approval is n't necessarily a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make the solar system considerably more attractive ! The Microgeneration Certification Scheme- ( MCS ) is a nationally recognised quality assurance scheme , supported by the Department of Energy and Climate Change . The Government are keen for all installers of solar PV systems to be signed up the MCS register , however there are some installers out there who have shunned the whole MCS process to allow them to install solar systems for cheaper . <p> What does MCS approval show ? Well it should provide a certain level of comfort that the installer did the job well " to certain industry standards . Likewise the MCS certificate also shows that the panels that have been installed have gone through rigorous testing that satisfy European and International standards . <p> The real kicker about inheriting an MCS approved solar panel system is that you should be able to benefit from the feed-in tariff . This is a payment for producing electricity from the solar system . The payments will depend when the system was installed so the next question to ask is exactly that . <h> Question 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will the age of the system dictate the Feed-in tariff payments you can expect to receive it will also give you a rough idea of when you are going to need to replace the inverter " normally the whole system should be good for 20-25 years , with the exception of this component . The reason the inverter only last this length of time is because they need to deal with kilowatts of power and high input DC voltages , so they need high power transistors and electrolytic capacitors " these components unfortunately just do n't last as long . <p> The cost of replacing an inverter on a 3.5kW system is approximately -800 " so if the system was installed 5 years ago " you need to budget for this payment within the next few years . <p> So back to the feed-in tariff " what will you receive ? Well the table below shows how the Feed-in tariff has changed since its launch in 2011 . On the left hand side of the table are the digression dates " these are the dates that the effective FIT payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed and registered on the 10th July 2013 , the payment would be 14.90 pence per kWh produced . <p> Digression Date for Solar PV <p> Feed-in tariff rate ( pence / kWh ) <p> 01-Aug-11 <p> 43.30 <p> 01-Apr-12 <p> 21.00 <p> 01-Aug-12 <p> 16.00 <p> 01-Nov-12 <p> 15.44 <p> 01-Jul-13 <p> 14.90 <p> 01-Apr-14 <p> 14.38 <p> 01-Jan-15 <p> 13.88 <p> 01-Apr-15 <p> 13.39 <p> 01-Jul-15 <p> 12.92 <p> 01-Oct-15 <p> 12.47 <p> The feed-in tariff is paid over 20 years , however if you were lucky enough to get in before this date it was paid over 25 years , so the returns will be even larger . <p> In order to calculate your expected feed-in tariff payments , you take the size of the system ( see Question 1 for how to do this ) " multiply this by 90% and then multiply it by the relevant rate from the table above . <p> For example " a 3.5kW system installed on 10th July 2013 <p> 3500 watts x 90% = 3150 kWh ( you can expect to produce each year ) <p> FIT payment = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 3150 kWh x 14.90 pence = -469.35 annual payment <p> This is tax free and goes up annually with RPI <p> That means that if you were to buy the house today , you would therefore receive a total income of approximately -8000 without taking into account RPI increases . This is on top of the energy savings that are illustrated at the end of question 1 so including these you could expect a total return of over -13,000 . <h> Question 4 " Were the panels installed as part of a rent a roof scheme ? <p> Some people installed solar panels on their home as part of a rent a roof scheme " this is where a third party will pay for the solar system to be installed , however the homeowner needs to sign over all the feed-in tariff payments to this third party . <p> Mortgage companies do n't like these schemes ! The third parties required a lease to be signed , which gave them access to your roof for 20-25 years . These leases are binding on any future buyers , so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the lease . Mortgage lenders will be concerned if installations come with a requirement to cover maintenance costs or grant onerous access rights to the provider so may not be happy to lend against such a property . <p> Also since the panels are in place and ca n't be removed under the terms of the lease , it means that if you have big plans to put on a roof extension or a similar development , you will need to wait until the lease lapses ! <h> Our final thoughts on buying a house with solar PV <p> As a buyer certainly should n't be put off buying a property with solar panels , however if the panels lack the MCS accreditation or were installed as part of a rent a roof scheme we would be very cautious . We would certainly seek legal advise if this is the case just to see where you stand . Having said that " it should certainly put you in the driving seat in terms of negotiations over the price . If however the owners own the property outright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can expect to pay a small premium on the house price as a result . <h> Installing Solar PV <p> Are you thinking about installing shortly ! <p> Interested in getting a solar PV system installed ? 184572 @qwx384572 <p> My mother in law has a house which we bought out right the solar panels we put on it .

I think as more and more properties swap hands that have solar panels in place , then the estate agents will get better and better and valuing it . My sisters property for example has both a ground source heat pump and solar ( they were on oil originally ) , and they receive a payment of approximately -1000 per quarter for the GSHP via the RHI and -280 per quarter with the FIT payments she has just put her property on the market and the estate agents do n't  know where to start ! <p> Hi Liz , we are seeing a few people struggling to sell properties that have free solar panels . The problem is that some mortgage lenders are funny providing mortgages to potential buyers that want to buy these properties basically it means you either need a cash buyer or you need to buy out your free solar contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels . We have all the relevant paperwork but despite this have just got to exchanging contracts and our buyer has pulled out . It seems as though they were put off by their solicitor . The question here is how do we proceed without getting to this stage again and the buyers pulling out . Should we provide all the pertinent detail to the agent and then have an estate agent who puts this information to a potential buyer up front or would it be wiser to pay the extortionate amount required by the installer and own them outright . It now stands at -27,500 as we have only had them for 5 years . <p> Hi pammysquirrel , I am very sorry to hear this . Unfortunately there is not a whole lot you can do about this you really only have two options , firstly find a buyer who is willing to take on the solar lease , or you will need to buy out the lease by paying off the company who put the panels on the roof . Obviously the second is going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Hi , you should speak the MCS association they should have a register . The reason installers could offer free solar panels in the first place was that they would receive the FIT payments rather than the household . In order to get the FIT payments , the install must have been carried out by a MCS certified installer hence the MCS accreditation body should have all the details of the install and the installer who put the panels on the roof . Hope that helps ! <p> My Husband and I bought our house in 2012 and it had a 4kW solar system installed on the roof . It is not something we would normally have looked at but actually we are thrilled with them now we understand how the gov. tariffs work . Basically we get paid every year for the next 21 years approximately -1500 an then we get the free electricity . It did mean we had to pay a small premuim for the property . Again we did n't  understand why , but our estate agent was actually very knowledgable and talked us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not sure if we bought a new house we would get solar panels again becuase I think the gov. tariff has really dropped so not sure it would be worth it , but I certainly would n't be put off buying a house with solar panels again ! <p> Great article , very interesting . One question though , you said " That means that if you were to buy the house today , you would therefore receive a total income of approximately -8000 without taking into account RPI increases . This is on top of the energy savings that are illustrated at the end of question 1 " so including these you could expect a total return of over -13,000 . " <p> I think I am misunderstanding this , but this comment seems to suggest that a ) I get paid for every unit of electricity I generate and then b ) I also then get to use those units of electricity for free ? <p> I thought the whole point of a FIT was that you get paid for generating elec and putting it back onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment for every unit of electricity produced regardless of whether it is used in the house or sold back to the grid . This is currently set at 12.47p for every kWh generated from the solar system . <p> 2 . The export tariff this is paid for every unit of electricity exported back to the grid ( 4.85p / kWh ) . <p> BUT since you can use the electricity produced from the solar panels in your home , you do n't  need to buy these units from the grid . The average price of electricity is about 12.5 pence per kWh , so this is a saving for every unit you use ( and do n't  have to import from the grid ) . <p> Since the export tariff is only 4.85p/kWh , and the price of energy is 12.5 p/kWh when bought from the grid , it is actually better to maximise the amount of electricity you use in the home and therefore export as little as possible . There are solar Optimisers that do just this they stop electricity being exported instead it is diverted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted , it is very unusual for a company to install an export meter so the energy companies ( which pay the FIT ) have no way of knowing what is actually exported . Therefore the energy company calculates this by assuming you export 50% of what is generated . This 50% figure is paid regardless of whether in reality you export zero electricity or you export 50% , so it makes even more sense to use the electricity you produce from your solar panels ! <p> I would like to muscle in before the Feed in Tariff is reduced at the end of this year . I need to move quick so does anyone know where I can buy Solar Panels and the mounting equipment ? ? need to move on this fast . <p> Hi Ac you need to actually have the panels installed by an MCS accredited installer . Once installed and registered on the approved database will you be in a position to successfully claim the generation and export feed-in tariffs ( FiTs ) . Hope this helps

The concept is really simple : stop cold air coming in and prevent warm air from escaping , using things like draught excluders . Keeping the warm air inside will save you money on your utility bills as the existing heating system will need to work less hard to keep the home at the required temperature . <p> Draughts or gaps in the home act like unwanted ventilation shafts , allowing cold air to seep in and hot air to escape . When the household heats their home , these uncontrolled ventilation gaps let expensive hot air escape . <p> Although more often than not , some heat escapes regardless of the actions of a householder , additional temporary draughts occur by leaving doors , windows and letterboxes- open . <h> Potential savings from installing draught proofing <p> It is estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could- save the household -60 per year on heating bills . <p> According to the- Energy Saving Trust , if every home- were to do this in the UK , the total energy savings could be worth as much as -190 million , and the energy saved would heat nearly 400,000 homes . <h> How do I- identify a draught ? <p> You- will be able to find- draughts- just about- anywhere in your- house that links- directly- to the outside .

Instead the panels emit far-infrared radiation , which travels unimpeded until it hits a solid object , which will in turn absorb the infrared and then heat up . Do not mistake infrared with harmful UV light , which is on the other side of the light spectrum " infrared is 100% safe . <p> The main thing to remember is that if the infrared radiation is impeded before it reaches its destination , then the object will not warm up . As a result , to get the most out of the heating panel it should ideally be fitted in the centre of the room . Or if you have a larger area and are getting a number of panels , then they should be evenly distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas so as not to be shadowed , which is why positioning on the ceilings is by far the most popular . <h> The distribution of infrared heater rays <p> When the panel is positioned on the wall or ceiling , the infrared radiation will travel at 45o angles in all directions . If they are in a corner and too close to a wall other than the one they are attached to , then you will be warming a small concentrated area ; this is not ideal since you will be wasting potentially useful heat . For this reason it is paramount that you do n't position the panels too close to the walls : rather centre ' them as much as possible . <p> 300Watt and 350Watt panels should be at least 0.5m ( 1.5 feet ) or more from the floor- " and the larger panels ( basically anything over 600Watts ) should be at least 1.5m ( 5 feet ) away . When the panels are on they will beam the infrared radiation up to 3m ( 10 feet ) . If you have higher ceilings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate models to use in this instance . <p> If you install the panels on the walls , then you should try and position them as high as possible . Positioning them too low will almost certainly result in furniture blocking the infrared radiation , which will limit their heating . <p> For the smaller panels we recommend having them at least 1.0m ( over 3 feet ) and for the bigger panels this to be positioned 2.0m ( 6 to 7 feet ) high . Like your radiators , the surface temperature of the panels gets to about 80oc , so do not touch or have objects too close to them . <h> The- installation process <p> All our panels come with a UK plug , so you can simply plug in and go , but we recommend hardwiring them into an electric circuit where possible . This allows you to use a proper switch ( like a light switch ) to turn them on . It also means you can install a smart heating system for optimal efficiency . We strongly recommend a professional installation and having the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Part P-qualified electrician . <p> In terms of the installations themselves we anticipate that most customers will seek the advice and expertise of a Part P qualified electrician who will hardwire the units to a thermostat and the property circuit board. - You can find out whether your electrician is Part P qualified by looking up their details on the Competent Person Register . <p> The infrared panels will invariably come with a frame on the back , which allows you to easily attach them to the wall . This does mean that the panels will sit about 1-2 cm off the wall . <p> Although the panels radiate heat from their front surface ( which will get warm ) , the reflector technology will ensure that there is no heat being emitted out of the back . The fact they are sitting away from the wall also helps in this respect . <p> Most of the panels that are sold should be supplied with screws and fixings to get the panels attached to the wall or roof . We do recommend getting an electrician to fix them in position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than simply run through an existing plug socket . <p> When the panels are plugged in , they take about 90- seconds to get up to full heat intensity and since you do n't need to wait for the air to get warm , you should feel their effect very quickly . To stop the panels from overheating , they will- modulate and come on and off as required ; however we recommend having them installed with some form of thermostatic control to ensure the room does n't get too warm . - The most basic option is a- timer plug adapter , however we recommend going for a proper thermostat and programmer unit if you have the funds available . <p> The installation is carried out as follows : <p> Mark and drill the four holes , insert wall plugs and screws with eye bolts supplied , these ensure about 0.5cm spacing from the ceiling ; <p> Tighten screws and insert the screws into the mounting profile on the reverse of panel . <p> Then when connecting to the wireless thermostat : <p> Connect a permanent 240 volt mains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Connect the infrared panel neutral ( blue ) wire to the neutral ( N ) terminal in the receiver , <p> Connect the infrared panel live ( brown ) wire to the normally open ( NO ) terminal in the receiver , <p> Connect a permanent link wire between live ( L ) and common ( C ) terminals in the receiver <p> This will ensure that when the receiver switches the power on it will reach the panel . Please note " switch contacts alone are volt-free and will not therefore supply power directly to the panel . <h> Installing infrared panels in the bathroom <p> Good infrared panels are either IP45 or IP54 rated , which means they can also be used in bathrooms . It is worth bearing in mind that building regulations state that any electrical bathroom installations should be undertaken by a Part P qualified electrician , who in turn will complete a BS7671 installation certificate . <h> FROM -339.99 <p> The pull switch or programmer needs to sit outside the bathroom . In terms of placement , the unit needs to be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bath . In addition if you are placing it above a washbasin , please ensure it is at least 13cm away . Again , your electrician should be able to advise and action as appropriate . <h> Benefits <p> Having your panels installed by a Part P qualified electrician will ensure that any potential risks are minimised . <p> Infrared rays are safe ! Do not confuse them with UV , which are not . <p> Fit and forget technology , very little maintenance required . 184564 @qwx384564 <p> Shadowing if there are objects inhibiting the movement of infrared rays across the room they may not work as effectively . <p> The thermal comfort will also depend on how well insulated your property is .

It is a wise move " around 30% of the heat in your home is lost through the roof , so insulating that space in between is going to really save you some money on your heating bill , and also help you do your bit for the environment . <p> The cost of this sort of work is going to depend on both the type of insulation you want to use , and how the insulation is going to be installed . This is sometimes really straightforward , or sometimes very involved and expensive . <h> Methods of Insulation <p> Simple joist level loft insulation <p> The easiest way to insulate your attic is to lay insulation horizontally across the joists , to a depth of 270mm or more . The process takes a couple of hours for a skilled installer , and is a cheap and easy way to insulate the space . The disadvantages are that you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order to store anything in the loft .

Insulating at the sloping rafter level is slightly trickier and will require a bit more technical expertise , but you can use a number of different materials and it will not affect the usefulness of the space to any great degree " apart from keeping it insulated of course . <p> Roof room insulation <p> If you have a roof room , you will have a trickier time trying to insulate the space . If it has none or poor insulation , then you have a few courses of action : <p> Insulate the residual space behind the stud walls " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulation , so is an easy win . <p> Insulate the stud wall , usually with a rigid board insulation , but can also be a vertical application of wool insulation , like Optimal Sheep Wool <p> Either tear down the sloping ceiling , insulate and refit the ceiling OR insulate the ceiling internally . You could use a thinner insulating material , like thermal liner , if you do n't want to be so drastic . <h> Types of Insulation Material <p> Fibreglass insulation <p> Fibreglass insulation , made from spun glass , is very cheap to install ( around -6 per square meter ) , but is a nightmare to install because of its itchy fibres . <p> Mineral or rock wool insulation <p> The most commonly found insulation material in a loft space is mineral wool or rock wool . It is pretty cheap stuff and has a good insulating effect . It is n't particularly nice to work with , but it will be cheap and easy to install . Typical costs are around -9 per square meter . <p> Rigid board insulation <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to keep upright and provide maximum insulation for the space available , rigid phenol board insulation is probably the best choice . Still relatively cheap , this sort of insulation is commonly used for rafter application , or in roof rooms and loft conversions .

It requires a thinner thickness of insulation compared to other insulation . Closed cell- spray foam insulation- is generally more expensive than open cell .

As a contractor I used 434 sq feet of insulation to cover an 550 sq foot loft , 116 sq ft of the loft was uninsulated and could not be PHYSICALLY insulated .

Does it make a difference or are you just wasting money ? <h> Floor and ceiling Insulation <p> Let 's say for argument sake you live in a flat with another dwelling below you . Chances are that they are heating their property to a similar level ( give or take a few degrees ) , to you . That means there is very little heat differential between you and your neighbour and adding insulation here is not going to save you any money on your bills , as it is not a heat loss surface . In fact quite a bit of heat would be transferred by convection and radiation- back towards your floor- from below- cancelling out effects of heat losses into the floor from your flat above . <p> This works exactly the same way with a ceiling that has another property above , as long as the dwelling above is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have missed a trick here what about heat loss through conduction ? This is where heat is transferred from the body of one object to another . Conduction is- not that relevant because most ceilings will have some sort of void this is an air gap between the floors , and luckily air is a poor conductor of heat meaning that very little heat would be lost this way . <p> This is why if you have a concrete floor on the ground floor you may want to insulate as heat loss through conduction may becomes quite material . <h> When can floor and ceiling insulation be worthwhile ? <p> Insulation between levels in flats is often done not for its thermal insulating properties , but for its noise reduction qualities . Adding a layer of wool insulation between you and your noisy neighbour is going to act as terrific noise proofing . It is pretty hard to quantify the monetary value of peace and quiet , so I will leave it up to you as to whether it is worth insulating for noise reduction purposes . <p> Some older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That means cold air entering the property and bypassing your wall or loft insulation . In these cases it is really worth considering insulation , which will allow the air to circulate but prevent it from getting into the living area . <h> How to insulate floors between properties ? <p> If you need to insulate between floors , you can do so in a very similar way to a ground floor . This means hanging the insulation under the floorboards or installing rigid board insulation on a concrete floor . <h> Insulating partition walls <p> This applies as much to houses as it does to flats , but the insulation will be carried out in different ways . <p> The first thing you need to understand is that there are 2 main types of party wall for the purposes of insulation " solid masonry partition walls where there is nothing but a single layer of rick between you and your neighbour , and cavity partition walls where there are two layers of bricks with a cavity between them . If you have a solid brick party wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property is unoccupied or seriously underheated . If you have a cavity wall that extends up into the loft space , you will be losing some heat as the differential between the inner wall and the cavity itself is bigger vs a solid wall . <p> You can insulate this kind of party wall in one or two ways " you can fill them just like a standard cavity wall , or you can use internal insulation installed on your internal wall . <p> Something you need to bear in mind when insulating a party wall is the ownership of the cavity " it may belong partially or completely to your neighbour , so make sure you speak to them before you start pumping insulation into the cavity . If you are just insulating the internal walls this is n't an issue of course . <p> Insulating your party wall is usually a little over the top however , as you only lose a little heat through that uninsulated cavity wall compared to exposed external walls , which are always worth insulating ! 
@@36748855 @5748855/ <h> Combi Boilers <h> Heating <h> What is a combi boiler ? <p> A combi boiler combines a highly efficient water heater and a central heating boiler into one compact unit . As a result , the combi boiler is fast becoming the heating system of choice in new homes across the UK , comprising 50% of new boiler installations . <h> Combi boilers and storage space <p> Combi boilers provide central heating and hot water without the need for a hot water cylinder in an airing cupboard or a cold water tank in the loft . The combi boiler is not only an ideal space-saving solution , but it also limits the amount of wasted heat when compared to traditional models , - as it does not have a hot water tank . <h> Combi boilers and heating hot water <p> Combi boilers take water from the mains and then heat it as required , but are on standby when there is no water demand . Therefore hot water is available 24/7 and also just as- importantly , the water is delivered at mains pressure , so no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided your home has adequate mains water pressure ) . <p> To produce the hot water that comes out of the taps , the cold mains water passes over a highly efficient heat exchanger . The heat exchanger transfers the vast majority of the heat from the burnt gas ( 90% or more ) to the cold water , and then delivers it to the taps as required . Since combi boilers do away with the hot water tank , they are much more energy efficient , since there are no heat losses associated with stored hot water , it is simply created as needed . <h> Combi boilers and your central heating system <p> On the central heating side , combi boilers pump the water round the heating system in a completely sealed system . The boiler incorporates an expansion tank internally , so there is no need for an external feed and expansion tank in the loft , which- obviously- saves a great deal of space . <p> One of the issues with a combi boiler is that they struggle to produce both hot water and central heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your domestic hot water whenever a hot water tap is opened in the home . For example , if you are running a bath , during this time no hot water will be circulated through your heating system , but as soon as the bath is full , the central heating circulation will resume . <h> Combi boiler efficiency <p> Since combi boilers do n't  have to store any hot water , the heat losses via the hot water tank are zero , helping save you money on your gas bills . <p> Most boilers installed today are condensing boilers , so if you choose a combi boiler , this will be a condensing model . These types of boilers use the heat contained within exhaust gases that would normally be released in to the atmosphere via the flue . They take advantage of heat exchangers to make the most of this latent heat , so less fuel is needed each time to heat the water , thereby further reducing your fuel costs . <h> The main 2 issues with combi boilers <p> The first issue is that since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot water is required in multiple outlets at the same time ( e.g. a shower and the washing machine are running at the same time ) , there will be pressure drops at the different outlets . There are two solutions for this ; firstly you can install a mains booster which- recognises when pressure and flow are low and automatically boosts the performance of the incoming mains water . These cost in the region of -300 -500 . The second solution is to install an accumulator tank ( approximately -500 -1000 depending on the size ) , which- is a steel vessel that stores mains water at the pressure it is supplied into the home . Air within the steel vessel ( trapped in a rubber diaphragm ) is compressed by the mains water . When a tap is opened , the water can rush out of the vessel to the tap faster than the mains can get into the property . The downside of the accumulator tank is that once all the water in the tank is gone , you have the same pressure issues that you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if your combi boiler breaks , you will have no hot water generating facility other than the kettle . Most hot water tanks ( within the system or regular boiler systems ) come- equipped- with a electric immersion heater , so even if the boiler breaks you can still produce hot water for showers and baths ( albeit in a rather expensive way ) . <h> Final thoughts on combi boilers <p> In homes where hot water demand is not huge , then a combi boiler is the most effective central heating/hot water system . They are very reliable and simple to install , they save space ( since they do away with cold and hot water tanks ) and produce the hot water on demand as it is required in the home . As a result , in most situations we would recommend installing this type of boiler when your current boiler reaches the end of its useful life . <h> Benefits <p> The hot water is available 24/7 on demand at mains pressure , giving that power shower effect . <p> Combi boilers are very compact and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small amount of space in your airing cupboard . <p> Combi boilers only produce hot water when it is needed , so no hot water is produced unnecessarily , which can help lower your bills . <p> There is no need for a hot water tank in an airing cupboard or a cold water storage tank in the loft . 184564 @qwx384564 <p> The main issue with a combi boiler is that it will struggle to cope with high demand for hot water from multiple sources at the same time , because the hot water flow rate is divided by each of the water sources . <p> If the combi boiler does break down for some reason , you will have no capacity to produce hot water other than the kettle . <p> Combi boilers are currently not compatible with solar thermal technology . <h> Cost <p> The cost of installing a brand new combi boiler in your home will obviously vary between suppliers , but prices will start from about -1800 + VAT to replace an old combi with a new energy efficient one .

They are rarely all used at once , but if for example all three showers were used at the same time would there just be a dribble coming out of the shower ? That is one of the things that makes me a little nervous ! I guess the other thing is what happens if the boiler breaks down . Obviously I wo n't have any hot water , but I assume the system will still allow cold water to run through it so at least water will come out of my taps ?

Unlike conventional boilers , all the hot water is made on demand . If the heating is on , but you want to run a bath , or have shower , the hot water produced by the boiler is sent to the particular tap / hot water outlet where it is required . For the duration of the tap / shower being on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central heating system . <p> So you can absolutely have your heating on and provided you do n't  run the hot tap then there is no problem . Likewise the hot water travelling around the central heating system is completely independent from the hot water that gets produced , so therefore if you stop water entering your home , provided the central heating has not be drained you can still have your heating on . <p> Hi Judith , a combi boiler will last about 10 15 years before it will need replacing . The combi boiler manufacturers have clocked on to the fact they need people to buy new boilers ( the old ones lasted 40 years plus ! ) so they nowadays tend to work perfectly for about 10 -15 years then they need replacing ! <p> My water pressure is rather low , having had it checked 3 years ago it was 4.00 bar . In view of this could I fit a mixer shower taken off the boiler ? Is there a particular type that is best for such a job ? <p> Living in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The initial hot water run off before a decent temperature is reached is a bucket full ! even when the tap is only half turned on .

Our boiler is now 5 years old , have improvements been made in more recent models , and if so , how ? <p> I presume the heating acts as a slave to the hot water when you install a combi boiler ? i.e. if you have the hot water running , no hot water will be sent around the radiators ? Is that correct ? It is only that my small tribe at home tend to all shower in the morning so I guess we woulnt be able to have the heating on at the same time as everyone jumps in the shower , so would need to set the heating on earlier in the morning ?

Although natural ventilation is the commonly low-cost practice to cool a building- efficiently during the summer , mechanical ventilation in theory appears to be more efficient due to several reasons that are explored in this article . <h> Mechanical Ventilation advantages over natural ventilation <p> Mechanical ventilation can be retrofitted- to almost every house and a large number of commercial premises- to promote fresh air into spaces and then remove any- latent heat . As previously discussed- ( reference to natural ventilation article ) , natural ventilation is based providing- fresh air to a building through openings such as windows and doors . The way it - works will depend on the type of the openings and the layout of the building . <h> Excessive solar gain and cooling with natural ventilation <p> The big issue with natural ventilation is that with glazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is excessive , it can cause local discomfort . In this case , mechanical ventilation would be more effective because it provides a more homogeneous effect due to a more- even- distribution of air . <p> The other issue with natural ventilation is that it can lead to excessive- cooling capacity of rooms and again this may be worse / better depending on the- building layout . <h> Mechanical ventilation reduces noise and air pollution <p> Mechanical ventilation is the only option when the building is located in noisy areas- or in areas where the local air quality is poor , and therefore the use of openable windows for natural ventilation is not a practical solution . It is worth noting that security considerations- may also lead to the use of mechanically assisted ventilation in many buildings as it allows the units to be securely locked . <h> However mechanical ventilation can be a costly solution <p> Mechanical ventilation definitely has merits over natural ventilation , but the issue comes to retrofitting a solution to a building , which could add quite a bit to the cost . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans , so that the costs to implement kept to a minimum . <p> Also , many companies lease the buildings that they occupy , so the decisions about the facilities management are taken out of their control . Landlord in turn would find it hard to invest in a system that would require significant funds but not so obvious quantifiable benefits . <p> The next section deals with some of the practical mechanical ventilation solutions and brief explanations on how they actually work . <h> Mechanical Ventilation Solutions <p> The simplest forms of mechanical ventilation systems simply circulate the air at the ceiling level , for example ceiling fans . They create air movement at the ceiling level to cool the space . <p> We may also have roof ventilators with louvers that help cold air enter the house and warm air to be exhausted as can be seen in Figure 1 . <p> Figure 1 : Example of roof ventilators ( BSRIA BG 2/2005 ) <p> The roof ventilators can also be solar assisted to enhance the stack effect by increasing the air temperature in the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stack effect is based on temperature difference within the space and the outside air the hotter it is at- the top of the building the quicker the latent warm air is allowed to escape . <p> Ducts can be used to supply air to different levels of a multi-storey building , using underfloor or displacement ventilation that provide fresh air from floor-mounted or low-level wall mounted ventilators within the occupied rooms or zones . <p> Figure 2 : Typical air flow pattern of displacement ventilation <p> In addition ventilated fa+ade systems that are installed in the window frames such as those that- can be seen in Figure 3 can also be classed in the mechanical ventilation family . <p> Figure 3 : Ventilated facade system <h> Supply and extract systems <p> Fan-assisted extracts work by enhancing the air movement to exhaust latent heat- when the internal temperature is high . <p> Mechanical ventilation systems can have both supplier and extract vents- assisted by fans as can be seen in the next se of figures. - These systems may also include filters to ensure a higher standard of- indoor air quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installing these systems they need to be- ideally positioned into spaced to take into account occupational density and well as tackling cold draughts . <p> Mechanical extract only systems are used mostly when the air becomes contaminated such as in kitchens , bathrooms etc where there is a need for constant and predictable extraction of air . Supply only systems are suitable for houses and occupied offices- that need to be supplied by fresh air when the air movement needs to be controlled . <h> Other mechanical ventilation systems <p> Another option for mechanical ventilation- systems is to go for- mixed-mode ventilation where the system works in conjunction with natural ventilation . It corresponds well to the operational performance of the occupied buildings providing indoor air quality and preventing summer overheating . <p> Mixed mode ventilation can reduce annual energy use by over 41% with 19% of this reduction is due reduced night cooling of the building . Night ventilation is enhanced by mechanical systems that ensure an adequate level of airflow to remove heat gains during night . <p> Figure 6 : Mechanically assisted night ventilation <h> Summary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why mechanical ventilation wins over natural ventilation : <p> The layout buildings does not help natural ventilation because the- spaces are too deep to be ventilated from the perimeter or the air paths are being mitigated- by the internal partitions .

Heating hot water for washing / cleaning accounts for the- second highest energy consumption in the home after heating , so- it is worth getting right in order to maximise energy- savings . Obviously , if you are on-gas then the options are pretty straightforward . A gas boiler can heat your hot water pretty cheaply and either store it in a hot water tank or deliver it straight to the required tap . However , when it comes to electricity the options are n't quite as simple . <p> The main reason for this is that electricity is fairly expensive , coming in at around 13p/kWh as opposed to 3p/kWh for gas . This means that not only does it cost 4 times to produce hot water using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of this wastage is also quadrupled . The good news is that there are several options available to you if you are- forced to heat your water with- electricity , so let 's take a look at the options . <p> With electricity , the cheapest way to heat your water is through renewables . This includes heat pumps , solar thermal systems and solar panels ( through solar PV optimisers/diverters ) . Although the heating of the water is extremely cheap , if not free , from these systems , the install cost is obviously high . <h> Heating your water with heat pumps <p> Heat pumps run just like a wet central heating system , except they only require 1 unit of electricity for around 3 units of heat . The resulting hot water is then stored in an insulated water tank to minimise heat loss . The result of this increased efficiency means that the cost of heating the hot water comes down to around the same cost as if it were a gas boiler . If you were on oil or bottled gas , these suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating system <p> For Solar Thermal systems , the power of the sun heats up water through panels or evacuated tubes on you roof . This warm ( not boiling ) water is then sent to the hot water tank , where it then needs to be topped up by your primary heating source , either an electric immersion heater or your electric boiler . While just heating your water with electric is expensive , the water has already been heated a lot , - so the amount of electricity required to run the immersion / electric boiler to top up the temperature- is actually very small . <p> It is quite expensive to install &amp; does n't provide all of your hot water , but it is free to run and will save you money for many years . <h> How to heat your water with solar panels <p> While Solar PV Panels do not directly provide heat , the surplus electricity that they generate can be sent into the immersion heater , via a Solar PV optimiser/diverter , to heat your water in the storage tank for free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or on cloudy days , the surplus is limited and so the water may not be heated to the required temperature . This would then require a top up from the main heating element . The benefit of a Solar PV optimiser/diverter is that it only uses the electricity that would otherwise be sent back to the grid " but ensuring you still get paid the usual 50% of generation as export . <p> Expensive to install &amp; may not provide all of your hot water , but PV has the added bonus of producing electricity for other parts of your home , and will pay back fairly quickly when you take into account government feed in tariffs . <h> Instantaneous water heating <p> Instantaneous water heating comes from small electrically powered units that heat water instantly as it passes through the system . While this is great because there is no wastage from heat loss through storage , there are drawbacks with water pressure . For example , a standard domestic unit can only provide water flow of around 6 litres per minute . As they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewables or a dual tariff electricity supply . <p> Cheap to install , these units can prove expensive to run in certain scenarios , and they can suffer from water pressure issues . <h> Hot water via the immersion <p> Water heated solely through electric immersion heaters are often found in properties that take advantage of a dual tariff electricity supply . So they can store the hot water heated from the low tariff in a well insulation hot water tank , to be used throughout the period of higher tariff , usually 07:00 to 24:00 . If this is the method of heating , then you need to make sure that the tank is well insulated with a cylinder thermostat to ensure no unnecessary heating takes place . <p> Most people already have a tank with an immersion heater , but install costs if you don ; t are considerable . Dual tariffs are gradually being fazed out in favour of time of use tariffs , but there is likely always going to be a place for the humble immersion heater in our homes . <h> Heating your hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for heating your property , it is still a relatively unheard of process for water heating . It certainly has potential , as seen with the popularity of home heating and the energy efficiency benefits it has . For water heating it has n't  quite received the same praise .

Maybe a technology to leave a few years yet . <h> Heating water with electricity a summary <p> So while on the surface , heating water with electricity is expensive , there are technologies that can help reduce the cost for electric only properties . From renewables to dual tariffs , instantaneous heaters to storage systems there are different options to choose from , all varying on install price and running costs . One thing is clear , if you are running your hot water through a hot water tank , make sure that it is insulated , with at least 38mm of foam or a 50mm insulating jacket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't being unnecessarily overheated .

The issue is that the electronic low voltage transformers may not . The reason for this is that they need a minimum voltage to pass through them to operate ; for example the transformer in my kitchen is 40w " 400w . Historically there were 6 50w halogen bulbs in the circuit giving a total load of 300w . <p> Replacing those 50w halogen bulbs with 5w LED equivalents will put a load through the transformer of just 30w in total .

I am confused as to whether its okay to use LED downlights in the circuit straight out of the box as my understanding is that you need to convert your circuit how everthis one does seem to be working with a mix of halogen and LED .

The GU10 LEDs are going to be a straight swap for most people , but you do n't  say if MR16 LEDs are worth converting to ( unlikely ? ) or even if they 're more economical if you 're about to have new lighting fitted and can choose either type of fitting . Obviously any type of LED is better than halogen at least 5x cheaper ( worst case scenario for the LED ) , but most likely 10x more ecenomical .

Should I still replace them and if so about how much are I dividjal transformers I have 6 downlighters in the kitchen and about 15 upstairs that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood if the energy consumption of LEDs is measured including the transformator or not . They generate large amounts of heat and use energy . I feel that the actual energy used is thus bigger than assumed . Am i wrong ? Tom <p> Can you please help me I used to have 6 Halogen Bulbs on one circuit then changed to 6 LEDS which worked fine but slowly one by one the transformers have packed in so I got some used ones and now the LEDS flicker . My original transformers were ET60T-5 , and the used transformers I have flicker which are ET60T-2 . Can you please suggest the best transformer I need to run 6 LEDS which are Osram 20w which are 12v5w <p> In my kitchen I have just replaced 20 halogen bulbs with MR16 LEDs . Each bulb has a separate Tamlite transformer attached . Once switched on and after a few seconds its like Saturday night at the disco . With the utility room there are 22 bulbs in all . Replacing each transformer will be too expensive . As each transformer is fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw away the transformers ant convert to GU10s . I 'm assuming the conversion is straight forward ? Your advice would be most welcome . Regards Bill <p> Hi Bill , replacing with GU10s is 100% what we would suggest . The transformers make replacing MR16 a bit of a pain especially given each bulb has its own one . The conversion to GU10 is very simple but we would always recommend getting a qualified electrician in to do this ! <p> Hi , quick question so everything you have said makes perfect sense and has helped me a lot thanks . So if I currently have 4 x MR16 bulbs on one transformer , then I can replace that with 4 x 6W led bulbs and use 1 x 24 watt led driver .. is that right ? <p> The IP rating is the Index of Protection and shows the protection rate of an electrical item from any external agents namely dust and solid objects and water . <p> The first number gives the protection level against solid objects from 0-6 with 6 the best protection ( i.e. no dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number gives the protection level against water ingress and goes from 0-8 . Again the higher the number the better the protection so something with IP X 8 can be fully submerged . <p> Thank you for the explanation , I was thinking of buying some GU10 to MR16 adapters but after reading this I realized that they would not work unless I changed the voltage and that 's just too much work , thank you <p> Hi , may I ask where you bought the LED " s . I have in the past purchased some cheap ones from eBay and they did n't  last long and started burning out ( smelling from base ) prob cheap components on the circuit board . Lesson learned , do n't  buy cheap from eBay So regarding your fault above one of the lamps could have short circuited and burned out the switch contact before the MCB . As mentioned if they are cheap ones I 'd replace them all . If not get hold of the shop you bought them off and explain your issues , they may replace them free of charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halogens in my kitchen , four in my bathroom . I 'm assuming that a transformer is installed to run each set of lights however I do n't  know if they are new or old style transformers , I cant access them without destroying the ceiling .. Is there a way around this ? What would happen if I connected GU10 LED bulbs with a MR16 male to GU10 female adapter ? <p> Hi , I replaced 5 MR16 transformers with GU10 fittings and LED bulbs . The first worked fine . I replaced the remainder which blew a bulb and tripped the fuse box . I removed the light bulb and tried again . It has now blown the switch and tripped the fuse box . There are 2 switches which control the 5 lights . One is a single switch unit ( which appears to be fine ) . The other has a two switch unit . One for the 5 bulbs the other for another 12v dimable circuit which seems to be the problem . I 've put out a request for an electrician but anyone any ideas ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not really electrically minded but I have 3 new mr16 colour changing bulbs and was wonder why they would flicker for a second and switch off . They are all 5watt rated so I wonder if you could send me a link to the transformer I would need from your shop . Thanks ! <p> Hi . I 'm wanting to swop my MR16 fittings to GU10 . Having just removed MR16s and fitted GU10s , they wo n't come on . I presume from reading here that there 's a transformer in the ceiling that I need to remove ? Can u just remove it and then wire them in ? <p> I am using GU10 led lights but i have a problem with this . all are dimmable lights . i am using these with a dimmer but my LED is flicking if the dimmer channel is switched off.My dimmer outs 40-50volts in off condition.Please find the solution . <p> Great article . More questions/comments please sorry ! ( 1 ) Many MR16s &amp; G4s are sold as 3 on a transformer . If you have several MR16s say 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply connect all 12 new LED bulbs to 1 transformer ( assuming that all 12 now draw the load required for 1 transformer ) ? ( 2 ) You do n't  always need to change the full fitting when swapping MR16 to GU10 . My kitchen had the loose fly lead connections in the ceiling downlights . I rewired these to GU10s mains and the old ceiling fitting still held the new GU10s . You would not be able to do this on rigid fittings though ! ( 3 ) Theres total conflict on websites about what dimmer should be used for dimmable LEDs ( leading , trailing , mains , 12V via driver etc ) . Please clarify . ( 4 ) You can now get dimmable G4s in 220VAC &amp; 12VDC . This asks the question is its best to swap the driver and use 12V LEDs or by-pass the original transformer and use 220V LEDs ? ( 5 ) I know that GU10 LED 220V on a dimmer they should be sold as dimmable , but if you use MR16 12V with a dimmable driver , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Another point worth noting many spots produce torch beams dark/light areas that are awful in kitchens . I 've found that the smd LED versions give much better light spread . Thanks Adam <p> Hi i have gu 10 led recess light at my 1st floor ceiling . I have a condensation problem at attic during winter because warm air from heater is slipping through my recess light to attic . Is it safe to cover and air seal light fixture from above at attic with proper heat proof box or metal box ? Thanks <p> I have recently replaced my MR16 halogens with LEDs without knowing about the transformer issue . Only two of the six I have replaced so far are flickering . The lights are embedded in the ceiling of a kitchen extension built in around 2006 . How do I tell if there is a single transformer for the system or indvidual ones for each light fitting . If it is a single transformer -where is it likely to be hidden ? <p> What no one seems to pick up on is the life of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly . Most damage occurs to the bulb in the sudden surge of power when the bulb is switched on . So I would say that all the hours the bulbs will last is not very accurate . Also there is no mention of a cost to fit new LED fittings , remove transformers etc . We are n't  all qualified electricians . <p> True , LED bulbs havent been around for 25 years so its impossible to say for certain . However , they certainly outlast the incandescents by a long long way . In terms of the fittings , you only need to change the MR16 fittings to GU10s . Every other fitting is fine for retro-fit bulbs . <p> Hi Steve , unfortunately you need to change the fitting , so you would need to buy 1 new fitting + bulb ( ideally LED ) to replace each MR16 you have . This should cost about -15--20 for each one you need to swap . Well worth it in our opinion especially if you are making the move from halogen to LED , so not only do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to get the ladder out every couple of months to replace yet another blown bulb ! <p> Good article thanks , having a couple of halogen transformers die this week , I decided to move to LED , and ive just converted from MR16 to GU10 + 5W LEDs for -10 per fitting including LED bulb today , saved me some money and time being able to strip out the transformers . So thanks . <p> Thanks for your comment John . Funnily enough I was in my brothers home with weekend and they were have the exact same problem with their MR16 bulbs in the kitchen . He is now going to replace the MR16 bulbs with GU10s to get around the transformer issue and obviously moving to LED will also result in considerable energy savings for them ! <p> You state : " The reason for this is that they need a minimum voltage to pass through them to operate " . I believe you mean " load " to pass through them . It is the load that causes the issue when it is not large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article by the way . It is nice to see that someone out there is discussing this issue . <p> James above is so correct . GU10 is a great way to go . No transformer and the LED bulb will have its own driver . Win win . <p> Re LED GU10 lamps . Has anyone else noticed that the life expectancy or these ( expensive ) lamps is far shorter that the Halagon ones ? I put the date on the lamp base just to check . I have now returned to Halagon for my kitchen till such time as the colour rendering is better and the life is better <p> 100% false . You mustve had 1 bad bulb ( LED bulbs are called lamps , I think , and they contain many LEDs in each lamp ) . The LEDs in each lamp slowly fail and thus the light dims ( 30% failed LEDs is where they deemed to be dead , I think , or 70% ? ) . Halogen bulbs claim to last 2000hrs ( 2 years average ) , but its more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an even bigger lie ! However , the EU implemented a law in 2014 LEDs now must last at least 6000hrs , so they last 3x longer than halogens , minimum ( more like 6x longer or more ) ! Either way , a 5w GU10 LED ( dimmable ) costs -4.50 , and 50w halogen ones cost -1 ? But , you should find a saving in just the light cost , as you may need 3-6 halogens per 1 LED lifespan then there 's the fact they 're only using 10% of the electricity . Absolutely worst case : 1x 5w GU10 LED dimmable will cost you roughly -10 total costs for its 6000hr ( 6yr av . ) ; You 'll need a minimum of 3x 50w halogens to last that long and theyll cost you -50 total in that time . <p> Hi David , I would definitely go for the GU10 over the MR16 then you can do away with transformer issues . They both have the same efficiency though so do n't  worry about that point a 5w GU10 will use the same amount of energy as a 5w MR16.

Compare this with gas and coal , which have taken millions of years to form " the CO2 released when these burn is added to the air . <h> How much does a wood burning stove cost to buy ? <p> The price of a wood burner starts at about -500 , however the price can quickly escalate depending on whether you need a new chimney flue and also if you are looking to produce a slightly more intricate fire surround with a mantle and hearth . Therefore the cost of buying a wood burner and getting it correctly installed could easily be in excess of -2000 . If you do require a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the necessary regulations " you can learn more about the regulations by clicking on the link below : <h> What fuels can be used in a wood burner ? <p> In theory there are several kinds of fuels that can be burned to a stove such as chips , logs , pellets and smokeless fuels . Some areas in the UK are known as smoke control areas " these are places where you are n't allow to emit smoke from a chimney unless you are burning authorised fuel or using exempt appliances . The authorised fuel includes any of the following smokeless fuels : <p> anthracite <p> semi-anthracite <p> gas <p> low volatile steam coal <p> So if you are based in London for example ( a smoke control area ) and want to burn ordinary logs , you will have to buy an exempt appliance " this is namely a wood burner that is DEFRA approved . <p> If you are therefore looking to buy a new wood burner and want the ability to be able to burn any wood in it , we would always recommend buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water is the enemy ! <p> One of the most important things to bear in mind when burning wood in your wood burner is to make sure it is dry . A freshly chopped tree will contain over 50% water " so trying to burn this will cause lots of different issues including difficulty in lighting the fire itself , low heat output from the logs and lots of smoke " it can also lead to rapid creosote buildup in the chimney flue which means more frequent chimney cleaning is required . <h> FROM -61.95 <p> Drying wood is known as seasoning wood and the purpose is to dry the wood so that it has less than 20% moisture content . The best way of seasoning wood is simply letting it sit out of the rain for 6-12 months before trying to burn it . Obviously if space is a premium then storing it in the home might not be an option , but provided you can cover it with a tarpaulin to stop it coming into contact with rain that should suffice . <p> Hardwoods , such as oak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as pine or fir , as they burn for far longer which means that you do n't need as many logs " although they do tend to be more expensive to buy in the first instance . <h> How much does wood burner fuel cost ? <p> If you are looking to buy the wood or anthracite for your wood burner you should expect to pay -5-7 for a 25kg net of Ash kiln dried logs . If you are buying in bulk then this price will come down considerably and also if you can pick up the logs directly from the distributor then again that will be far cheaper as palette delivery is expensive . A 25kg should last a few days if you are just lighting the stove fan in the evenings . Obviously if you are shoveling in the wood and keeping the stove on all day then the wood will be used much quicker . <p> If you decide to opt for the anthracite then you should expect to pay twice the price of the wood , so -10 " 15 per 25kg bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so comparing the two in terms of cost and heat produced from a 25kg bag they are about even . <p> The running costs of a wood burning stove are therefore pretty good especially if you spend lots of time in the room with the heater as hopefully it means you can avoid putting your central heating on altogether . The cost of installing the stove might be prohibitively expensive for some and unfortunately there is no Government help currently available to help cover some of the install cost " having said that , if you can source the wood for free ( from a local farm for instance ) then you can heat much of your home for free . We really do recommend getting the DEFRA approved stove though since this means you can burn whatever fuel you can get your hands on !

Houses built before around 1930 's were constructed with a single skin of bricks . While nice to look at and very much of the period , they are terrible at maintaining heat within the property . As there is no cavity to fill , they have to be insulated by installing insulating material onto the external walls " or indeed to the inside . <p> This dramatically increases the thermal resistance and helps maintain the property 's warmth throughout winter , while also keeping the home cool during the hot summer months . However , properties built after this period tends to be built using two skins of brick . This leaves a gap in- which insulating material can be injected , or added during construction . The question is , does cavity wall insulation do enough , or should you apply external solid wall insulation ? <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulate a property using external solid wall insulation , the system is finished off with a clean rendered finish in a colour of the customer 's choice . A revitalised property can not only brighten up the home but also increase the value of the home . Many properties with exposed brickwork look old and dirty . With a nice rendered finish , these homes are revitalized and help transform them into much sort after properties . Many properties that were built with cavity walls , but not insulated , were also rendered at the same time . This means that if you were to insulate them with cavity wall insulation , you would be left with spots from where the drilling and injecting took place . This damages the appearance of the property and makes it look untidy . A fresh rendered finish over , 100mm of external solid wall insulation , can often be a much better way of insulating . <p> There has been a lot of press recently surrounding the negatives of retrofitting cavity wall insulation . From radio stations talking about damp , to T.V @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a properly credited installer will never have problems and that the number of complaints is a fraction of the industry 's successful installs , we understand that many people are n't entirely comfortable with the process . External solid wall insulation provides a much more weatherproofed solution , not only halting permeating damp from entering the cavity but also preventing weathering from having a lasting negative effect on the external walls of the property . External wall insulation on cavity walls has further benefits though . <h> The effects of External solid wall insulation on U-Values <p> Retrofitting a cavity wall property with injected insulation obviously increases the thermal insulating qualities and lowers the U-Value " heat transfer through the wall . However , to reach the levels of insulation required for the highest level of energy efficiency it might not be enough . Retrofitted cavity walls still leak heat , and with external insulation you may find that you continue to pay large energy bills . One technology that is highly dependent on a well-insulated property is the heat pump . As you may already know , heat pumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be efficient , and installing them with just retrofitted cavity wall insulation may result in it using huge amounts of electricity in order to reach the required temperature set in the home . Applying external solid wall insulation further reduces the U-Value to below 0.3 , meaning the heat pump can work efficiently . In fact , it may only need to be on during the deepest winter months . <h> Do n't  just fill the cavities , externally insulate as well <p> So do n't just think that because you have cavity wall property , that has be retrofitted with insulation , you ca n't insulate it further " you can use- external wall insulation on cavity walls . The only extensive insulation method is external wall insulation " it gives you the best U-Value , improves the look of the property and protects the brickwork against weather and penetrating damp . 184574 @qwx384574 184572 @qwx384572 <p> If you have a house in the SW of England and it gets lashed with rain , DO NOT GET CAVITY WALL INSULATION .

Well , this is infrared heating in action . <p> To find out more details about infrared heating click here , but below we are going to list our top 10 advantages of using infrared heating panels to heat your home . <h> 1 . Infrared panels produce almost instant heat <p> The infrared heat is emitted from the panel almost instantly , so no more waiting for a room to warm up . <p> The cost of running an infrared panel versus an electrical convection heater is far cheaper as they require less power output to provide the same level of heat " for instance a 600w infrared panel will provide the same level of heating comfort as a 1500w convection heater , so they roughly require a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 3 . Smaller room temperature differentials <p> With convection heating , warm air tends to end up near the ceiling and cold air tends to sit at floor level . With infrared heating , the temperature differences across a room are far smaller so you can enjoy a more consistent temperature without any cold spots ! <h> 4 . Infrared Panels can help reduce mould <p> Since infrared heat solid objects , if you direct the panels to face damp walls , it should help to dry them out which this in turn will reduce the formation of mould . <p> Infrared heating panels simply run on electricity , so there is no need to install a boiler and additional pipework for them to run . The panels themselves can also be used to heat a whole house and since they can be turned on and off as needed and produce heat almost instantly , you can very easily produce a zone heating system ( for each room ) to match your requirements . <p> A typical system consisting of 4 panels will take just one day to install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow you to maximise living space <p> Infrared heating panels can be hung from the ceiling , so you do n't lose any floor area like you would with radiators . By doing this it also increases the heating coverage area of the panels . For example an 850w panel will heat 13.5m2 area if hung on a wall , but a 17m2 area if attached to the ceiling . To be honest , they are only 2.5cm thick anyway so even on walls they are not going to steal too much room ! <h> 7 . High quality &amp; Low maintenance <p> Provided you buy quality panels you can be sure that they are going to last a long time and will not need any maintenance ( our panels come with a 5 year warranty ( 0ur Select range ) or 10 year warranty ( our Inspire range ) . <h> 8 . Infrared heating Reduces Allergies <p> Since infrared does n't rely on air as the medium for transporting the heat ( like conventional convection heaters e.g. radiators ) , there is far less movement of air which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , helping to reducing their impact . <h> 9 . Other Health benefits <p> Infrared is naturally produced by the sun and is the reason that you can feel warm on a sunny but yet a cold winter 's day ( it is not the same as the harmful UV radiation that is the other end of the visible light spectrum that causes sunburn and can damage the skin ) . <p> This infrared is absorbed by the body , which causes it to increase blood circulation , which has many of health benefits including : boosting immune functionality , detoxing and reducing joint stiffness . <h> 10 . Our Infrared heating panels- look fantastic ! <p> The panels look great and are multifunctional " they- can double as mirrors in bathrooms or even have pictures printed on them ( much like when you get a canvas printed ) . <h> 8 comments <p> I see this article was written in 2013 , and now obviously a few years later I would expect you will have a lot more experienxe with whether infrared works well in the UK or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plug , but on your website I read that you should always look for a UK plug . Can you tell me which ones I should go for ? Also if I imported the infrared heaters from America would they work in the UK ? <p> Has anyone here experiences the benefits of infarared heaters with respiratory ailments ? My husband and I both suffer from respiratory problems particularly when the air is humid and damp . We have tried everything to inprove our daily lives but nothing seems to have worked . Infrared heating panels are my last hope . Any insight would be greatly received . <p> Hi Ted , thanks for your comment . These residential Infrared panels are relatively new to the UK , but as your comment suggests , when people get them installed they tend to never want to go back to their old heating systems !

You can read more about them here . <h> Why might you need to change your meters ? <p> There are lots of situations where you might need to switch meters including : when you have had storage heaters replaced with another form of heating , when you have switched to storage heaters from other electric heating , when you have drastically changed the way you use your energy or where you have a historic system ( just moved in to a new property ) . <h> Is it worth getting your meter changed ? <p> We have covered the value of economy 7 meters before , but just to highlight the key point , if you use more than 40% of your electricity at night ( between 12 and 7am ) , it is worth staying on the dual rate tariff , or indeed moving to it . If you are using less than that , you are better off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising how much you could save , and we have seen customers switching both ways that have saved -200 a year by switching from dual to single or vice versa . So it really is a good idea for some households . You can work out the savings by taking a close look at your bills , or even speaking to your provider . <h> How easy is it to change meters ? <p> Depending on your supplier , this might be as simple as a phone call and a change of tariff , or it could mean changing the meter over to a new single rate model . It is certainly possible for the supplier just to take 2 readings instead of one and charge the same rate for both , but some companies do not like to do this and will want you to switch . <p> There does not seem to be a particular pattern here " some providers will be happy to just change your tariff , whilst others insist on a new meter . If you are switching providers , try calling both your old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can get it done cheaper by either company . <h> Does it cost to get your meter changed ? <p> Most energy companies will charge you to switch to a different type of meter , whether that be single to dual , or dual to single . This can vary from -60 to a few hundred , but some providers will make the switch for free . <h> 2 meters vs. dual meter <p> This is less common but it can complicate the situation , depending on a number of factors . Some customers have 2 meters in one house , one for day rate and one for night rate , whilst other customers will have 2 meters with different appliances running off of each meter " usually because the property used to be 2 flats for example . The approach for you here should still be to try your energy provider as a first option , but if you do n't get any joy , you should try contacting your regional electricity network supplier , which is often written somewhere near your meters . They own the meters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meters changed . If you have 2 separate MPAN numbers , it is worth trying to get these combined as you will not be paying 2 separate standing charges ! <h> Think carefully before switching meters <p> Changing your meter over can be a really drawn out and frustrating process . The energy companies often take weeks to get an engineer to you , and there can be complicating factors , so make sure the savings are there first before you proceed . It really can be worth it for some customers , whilst others are better sticking with what they 've got . <h> 2 comments <p> My friend has Total Heating Total Control tariff and storage radiators and it is estimated to be going to cost her nearly -4000.00 next year Most of her use is at the higher tariff .

However , green politics ' were not really on the agenda until the late 1970 's . The earlier part of that decade was a turbulent time for global energy prices due to two key crises : the OPEC crisis1 , which was later followed by the Iranian Revolution2 . These two events affected the UK by raising energy prices . <p> Domestically in the 1970 's the economy was paralysed by industrial action . Namely , the coal industry was a heavily unionised sector and coal fired power stations were the dominant energy enabler for electricity production in the UK .

One is solar PV , where the sun 's energy is turned into electricity . The other is solar thermal , where the heat from the sun is used to directly heat water , which is then used to heat your hot water cylinder . <p> Over half a million homes in the UK now have solar PV , but thousands of homes also have solar thermal too which has seen a surge in popularity since the RHI was launched last year . - So in this blog we want to consider which is the better investment , if you had to buy one of these systems , which system should you go for - solar PV or a solar thermal system read on- to find out our thoughts ! <h> Cylinder for solar thermal <p> Solar PV takes up a lot of space on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof to fit a reasonably-sized system , whereas solar thermal is much more compact and even the smallest roof can potentially accommodate a solar thermal system , as long as it is sunny enough ! <p> Solar thermal is an RHI qualifying measure <p> Whilst solar PV generally takes up more space on the roof , solar thermal requires more space in the house . You will always need to have a hot water cylinder for solar thermal " which is a bulky annoyance in your home , unless you have a good spot to put it in . Of course , if you already have a cylinder , this might not be an issue for you , but remember if you need to add a cylinder it will seriously increase the cost of the installation . <h> Solar PV can create hot water too <p> Whilst solar thermal is limited to heating your hot water , PV can provide you with electricity and hot water . All you need is to use a solar optimiser to divert excess electricity to your water cylinder . <h> From just -249.99 <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myth that solar technology does n't work in cloudy weather , but it is true that performance dips considerably . PV is much more sensitive to the sunlight and as such , solar thermal will provide more return in cloudy weather than PV does . <h> Solar thermal could- leak Solar PV ca n't ! <p> It may seem obvious , but because solar thermal heats water directly , it needs lots of pipes running from the roof into the house . Now hopefully , if it has been installed well , you should n't have any leaks , but there is always that risk with a wet system like solar thermal . Solar PV is a dry system , so no danger of any accidents ' ! <h> From -129.99 <p> On the other hand solar thermal has a really important advantage " you can store the energy you produce " you do n't need to use it as it is produced . Solar PV will need a power diverter to store the energy produced in your cylinder , and that means an extra cost of -300 or so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generated . <h> Solar thermal gets the RHI <p> The RHI is relatively new , but pays you for generating heat from solar thermal , amongst other technologies . <h> Solar PV gets the Feed in Tariff <p> The Feed in Tariff is paid for generation , with an additional payment for exporting energy to the grid . Find current rates here . <h> Bigger savings with PV <p> Whilst solar thermal certainly has its advantages , you will see bigger savings on your energy bills with PV . A typical solar system could save you -100-200 a year , whereas a 3kW PV system is likely to save you -300 or more . <h> Cost of installation <p> It is not possible to say one is cheaper than the other , as it depends on the size of the system you are installing . A solar thermal system could set you back -4,000 on a typical install , whilst a PV system will cost around -1,750 per kW .

@@36748874 @5748874/ <h> Impact of orientation , pitch and shading on solar PV <h> August 3 , 2015 <p> I 'm sure most people are aware that solar PV productivity is affected by a few key environmental factors . The most obvious one and the one that has the biggest impact is exposure to sunlight . Panels that have the biggest exposure are going to produce the most electricity . This is n't exactly rocket science , but it means that ensuring your panels get the maximum exposure during the course of the day is going to be crucial . <h> Orientation and solar PV <p> Due south is always going to be the best orientation to point your panels at , but sometimes that is n't always possible . Being in the northern hemisphere , the sun is always slightly to the south , even in the height of summer when it is high in the sky . That means that panels placed on the south roof of a house will generate much more electricity than one on the north side . East and west facing panels will have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels are going to be at least partially obscured . <p> Even so , having panels absolutely due south is not an essential element . Many homes in the UK have panels at a south east or south west orientation , because there is not a suitable due south roof available . This can reduce the efficiency of the panels a little , but only by a few percent , so orientation is not as big an issue as you might think . <h> Pitch and solar PV <p> As well as the orientation , the angle at which the panels are pitched is important . The ideal angle is about 30 degrees off the horizontal , simply because this allows the panels to extract more from the sun in the morning and the evening , whilst still making the most of the mid day sun . It is a bit of a trade off between getting energy from the sun at the start and end of the day , and getting the energy from the high midday sun . <p> Of course , some roofs will not allow this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as efficient a pitch as possible . You will notice that flat roofs with solar panels do n't have the panels flat on the roof , they are fitted on brackets that tilt the panels to around 30 degrees . <h> Shading and solar PV <p> Shading is much more important than some might believe , and something that installers have to take great care of . Having a panel in shade will dramatically reduce its electricity production , and turn a profitable installation into a poor one . <p> Shading analysis is usually carried out by an installer prior to installation , looking closely at where the prospective panels will be affected by shade hitting the panels from surrounding buildings and trees . It is crucial to do this because most systems use a single inverter , and one panel being affected by shade means every other panel can only produce the energy produced by that shaded panel . If shading s going to be a problem , the installer may recommend the installation of micro-inverters , which negate this problem and means every panel will produce electricity independently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different potential positions of the sun " the path taken by the sun during the course of the day and with the changing seasons . Installers will try to minimise any hard shading from chimneys or trees by taking all the angles into consideration , and ensure that if there has to be some shading , that it is only during the start and end of the day when electricity production is low anyway . <h> Optimise your PV system <p> It is really important that you get a few different opinions before you install your PV system . A poorly located and sited system is going to be a very inefficient and not produce the energy you- would expect , so make sure you get it right the first time .

The advantage of this type of wall was that water could penetrate the outer skin of brick , but then when it reached the void- there was no way it could cross to the inner leaf , ensuring that damp never made it into the home . <p> In the 1970s , oil prices sky-rocketed and this saw- energy bills increase , so- the decision was taken to utilise the cavity for an additional purpose to house insulation . The aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thereby helping lower energy bills. - Today , cavity walls are still a popular building type and it is a requirement within building regulations that the cavity is filled with insulation to help limit heat loss . <p> Building a property- and including cavity wall insulation at the same time is pretty easy , but obviously there were millions of cavity-walled properties built between the 1930s and 1970s without- insulation . In the 1980s , a method was developed that allowed these unfilled cavity walls to be injected with insulation- and millions of properties have been injected with insulation since . <p> If you do a quick search of the internet , you will find many people- who are dead against cavity wall insulation the reason for this is that in some cases the cavity wall insulation can cause problems ! <h> Problems caused by- cavity wall insulation <p> There are a few common problems caused by cavity wall insulation that- are discussed in detail below : <h> Urea-formaldehyde was used in the cavity <p> When cavity wall insulation first began several decades back , a particular type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , releasing a toxic urea-formaldehyde gas . If you have this type of insulation you may want to get it removed since it could have health implications as- the gas is carcinogenic . The other problem- with this particular type of cavity wall is that as it breaks down it slips down the cavity leaving the top of the cavity insulation free , so heat loss can occur . <p> The good news is that as a result of modern standards , this type- of insulation is no longer installed ! <h> The building is not suitable for cavity wall insulation <p> Millions of properties benefit from the energy savings produced by cavity wall insulation , but not every building is suitable . If the building- is located- in an area of the UK that has high exposure to wind and rain , then cavity wall insulation is probably a bad idea . Remember one of the primary purposes of the cavity is to drain water away from the inner leaf of the brick , but if the cavity is filled , this new insulation can create pathways for water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . <h> Incorrect property type for insulation <p> Rogue installers have been known to install insulation in properties that are not suitable , like steel framed and timber framed properties or those with porous bricks that allow the insulation to get damp. - We get a huge number of phone calls from homeowners who are unable to sell their property and buyers unable to get a mortgage due to the presence of cavity wall insulation in timber framed properties . <h> Flood or Fire Damage to Insulation <p> If the insulation gets wet or otherwise damaged by an unforeseen event like flooding , the insulation may need to be removed . An example might be where the water tank bursts or where there is a chimney fire . Here , replacement insulation is likely to be recommended once the defective cavity wall insulation is removed . <h> Poorly installed cavity wall Insulation <p> The final reason is perhaps the most common problem associated with cavity wall insulation and is the most common- reason why people look to have cavity wall insulation extracted . If wool is being injected into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a high chance there will be gaps in the wall where there is no insulation. - This can cause damp , so it may be recommended that the insulation should be removed . <p> Likewise if beads are injected into the cavity they should always be injected with some sort of adhesive to help hold the beads together when they are in place . Unfortunately this process takes far longer than simply injecting the cavity wall insulation beads without glue , so many installers forget to do this as it allows them to race from job to job . <p> The good news is that cavity wall insulation can be removed with minimal fuss . If suitable/appropriate , new insulation can be injected into the cavity or a completely different type of wall insulation can by used leaving the cavity empty- ( e.g. external wall insulation ) . <h> How can you remove cavity wall insulation ? <p> It is currently possible to extract a range of insulation types , including mineral fibre , expanded polystyrene ( beads ) , and urea formaldehyde . <p> Where wool insulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large vacuum machine . In the case of glued beads or urea formaldehyde , to extract this type of insulation from the cavity , bricks are removed and the insulation is broken up using a specialist type of machinery .

Now it sounds not such a rare problem . how do these firms justify themselves making peoples lives a mysery . do they think people enjoy being worried to death when they wo n't do the right thing . <p> My wife has become very allergic to formaldehyde . We discovered that we had urea formaldehyde foam in our cavity walls . I found a company that specialised in removing it . The boss of the company said that the foam would have started to degrade . However , when they came to remove it the foam was rock hard and they had a hell of a job to remove it . We had to seal up everywhere in the bungalow to stop the stuff coming in . It does go into the loft and they hovered that out to the best of their ability . We just has a formaldehyde test done in our property having already removed anything that could be giving off high levels . We had very low levels of VOCs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formaldehyde levels are elevated.at 54 ug/m3 . My question is has the formaldehyde impregnated the walls ? <p> We had paper insulation put in the walls , but the walls are ice cold , it does not seem to have improved the warmth of the property . Would like it removed and straw insulation installed , but how much would this cost ? The paper insulation has been in about 10 years , so is still under guarantee ( but I think the paper insulation is rubbish ) . <p> Hi Peter , With regards to WHO carried out the installation of CWI at 40 Balston Road , Poole , Dorset , we can run a CIGA Guarantee search for you . Please get in touch , if you require further assistance . Regards Southwest Insulation &amp; Extractions Ltd <p> Hi we are having problems with wet Rockwool insulation in our block of flats . Could you find out if we are covered by GIGA ? The flats are at Haddon Court Queens Promenade Blackpool Lancashire Fy2 9BB Many thanks <p> We currently have one wall which is effected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at it think its probably due to the cavity wall insulation , so I have been searching that online . <p> I have read about CIGA , but we have no paperwork on the CWI due to it already being in the house when we purchased it . Can I contact the CIGA to find out if we are still under warranty ? Also does anyone know their contact details ? Thank you . <p> My company would suggest not to have any insulation put in the cavity unless the cavity is totally clean from debris / rubble . Bead however seems to be the most durable of the insulation form and have not come across many problems when this has been the insulation installed . Most of the surveyors that work for insulation companies are not surveyors at all and work on commission . <p> I was very interested in what people had to say . I had my free cavity insulation ( beads ) in June last year . This was done through E.ON . I have had appox ten visits since as the beads are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorted before it starts coming out somewhere else . I am at my wits end and about to contact E.ON. yet again . I would love to have ALL the beads removed any one got any suggestions ? <p> Hi Lorna , If you fill in the form above we can provide you with a quote to remove the existing insulation . We can then get it installed properly if you would like or if you would prefer you can leave the cavity free from insulation . <p> At ExtractUK Ltd , we specialise in cavity wall insulation removal . Yes , you do get a 25 year guarantee ( generally not for foam ) but if the problems have occurred with the last winters storms the insulation companies and CIGA are more than likely to say they will not cover this under their guarantee , as the guarantee covers workmanship and the product . They will not usually cover if your property has any defects in the mortar . What we are finding is properties that seem to be affected have rubble and debris in the cavity and shouldnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been picked up by the surveyor . Please be advised that the moment you remove a brick , or make any structural changes , you may instantly void any guarantee you do hold . <p> Hi , bought property 1year ago now , and have damp problem on south facing wall . Previous owners had cavity walls insulated . ( can see the holes that are filled on mortar joints where insulation would have been with injected or blown in ) . On home report high damp levels were reported , but was told this was now rectified . Internal walls had been re plastered and decorated too . Unfortunately damp has returned . Would it solve problem to remove insulation in cavity on problem wall only , or would this create a cold spot and make problem worse ? All other walls seem fine , bar the one with damp . Air bricks have also been sealed . Am keen to solve problems but do not want to create another , as am thinking if cavity is filled all round the house , no air can circulate , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be leaving a void with no air to pass through . Could this also cause dampness if done . I have decided to take this upon myself so any advice would be appreciated . Problem wall has garage on lower half built onto it , so was thinking of removing brick at dpc level every metre and sucking it out with specialist vacuum from suitable hire shop , then refit bricks and repoint . Would this work ? ? ? All advice appreciated . I 'm joiner to trade , and work for small building firm so am willing to do work myself . <p> Caz I am having exactly the same problem you had . Had CWI done 4 years ago for free with a government grant . Now regretting the decision as we are suffering with rising damp as the insultation has dropped below the DPC . The walls are damp and mouldy and my childrens bedrooms are so mouldy which is not good for their health . After the heavy rain , the damp is now awful . We now need to look into having this removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installed the CWI remove the insultation if I complain or will we need to pay to have it removed as well as having to repair all the problems caused by the damp as well . Various builders have said our property was not suitable for CWI and the air bricks have been blocked . I wish I knew what I know now ! ! I have a certificate but can not find a guarantee as such . Any suggestions will be appreciated . Many thanks . <p> Georgina , If the insulation was installed with a government grant , it should have a 25 year industry guarantee through an organisation like CIGA . In which case it should not cost you to get it removed . Look at your certificate and see if it has contact details . <p> HI I had cavity wall insulation ( rock wool ) removed due to damp on internal walls all along base of the hall -which worsened when it rained . My surveyor advised the retro fittred cavity wall insultation was responsible as outside wall was sited to suffer wind driven rain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installers to remove under the CIGA guarantee . They agreed to remove as a good will gesture stating the insulation was not cause of damp but the wind driven rain and porous render would have been too much for the insulation and broke it down . Though inspector later advised me the wool thathad been used was no longer used as it holds water , I was just happy just to get it removed . A month ago the team took it out . After a couple of dry weeks damp got much better we had rain and it all came back . I rang them they came up and looked with a camera advised me some wool was still remaining and they come to take it out . . Though the areas of damp did not relate to areas of wool left when i watched them removing it . I thought my damp problems were over and watched the lower walls all dry out again.i usea little water gadget though i know they are not considered very accurate I thought just by the pattern of readings decreasing show it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and walls looking damp again and all readings back up high . Has anyone had insulation removed and faced these issues ? does the damp go i am trying to understand if I should be contacting the insulation company again or exploring other options and considering my surveyor/home buyers report and the supporing damp survey i also obtained had the wrong cause of the damp ? Help anyone ? <p> Hi Caz , I know its a while since your post but for you or others reading this , has anybody had a look in the cavity at DPC level ? It is quite possible you have mortar droppings , bits or brick that had blown off from the installation , and dirt bridging the DPC . A common problem and one that many installers of insulation do not consider . <p> Hi , make sure that you have unblocked the air vents which would have been blocked up by the installers . Also install air bricks to the top of the wall as your loft insulation has probably closed off the cavity stopping the drying out stack effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 stretchers . Rising damp is a myth . If the damp occurs onlywhen it rains then install a french drain around your property at least 150mm wide around your property .. DO NOT take advise from people who are trying to sell you a product . I have spent many years aquiring my knowlage and it upsets me that people are still been ripped off by uncompassionate salemen with no construction knowlage . <p> I would suggest from what you have said that it would be well worth getting a reliable builder to remove 4 bricks every 1.5 metres along the base of the wall one brick above the damp course . Obviously only in the area affected . I suspect that you have a breached dpc which is often the case ( not rising damp as such ) if there is debris breaching the internal damp course this would be your problem and by taking the bricks out as described , it would enable the builder to remove this debris . The cavity wall insulation probably did n't  help if it is breached by debris . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulation has to be removed . Especially after the heavy rain last winter extraction firms are having a field day ( or year ) . My conclusion is that especially with fibre insulation you are taking pot luck with damp , the risk may be as high as 50% . Installers will not necessarily advise against it because they do n't  do a detailed enough survey . After 6 months my walls are still wet . But apparently , its not the fault of the insulation company . Look up the Daily Telegraph article . <p> Tony thanks for your comments . While there is always a risk when you retrofit your property in most cases even with extreme weather the current industry research suggests that problems only arise in a really small number of cases . The CWI should be backed by a CIGA 25 year warranty to help protect the consumers should issues arise . If in doubt , as the article suggests consult the opinion of independent expert ( structural engineer ) , who should be able to provide advice tailored to the condition of your property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of modern standards the formaldehyde gas is a carcinogen ! As it is a foam that hardens , in what way can you suck it outplease do some research before writing . The trend for free cavity insulation is a Greenwash . The Government pays for it to go in raised by inflated fuel bills , then the owners the have to pay for it to be taken out when they can not bear the dampness that results from stopping the air circulation in the cavity . <p> The author of this blog is clueless about Cavity Wall Insulation . " Fortunately , it is relatively rare that the insulation will need to be removed ! " utter rubbish , a simple search in Google will bring up on many forums where house owners have been persuaded by the Government to have this stuff pumped in to their walls , with devastating consequences . <p> Previous owners of my house had this installed , now my cavity insulation is saturated with water , and the internal walls destroyed , the smell of damp is soul destroying . CIGA who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local Council couldnt give a sh ! t , its my problem not theirs . <p> I have quotes of -2000 to get this insulation removed . Still debating which of my body part I can sell in the black market to raise the money . <p> Hi John couldnt agree more , we now have condensation where there 's was none black mould on other areas , since having this stuff pumped into the walls . our house is freezing in the summer , who has their heating on in the summer , we never did . It is time and money wasted . <p> Hi John , thanks for the comment . Unfortunately there are some cases where cavity wall insulation is absolutely not the answer , but 13.4 million people have cavity wall insulation in the UK ( out of the 26.9m homes ) so obviously it works for the majority ! I guess the issue with the internet is most people only use it to complain if you had it done and it worked fine it would be unlikely something you would shout about on a forum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope you get it all sorted with all your body parts intact ! <p> The older Urea-formaldehyde used in the 1970s is removable since in most cases it has broken down which makes the process relatively straight forward . Also , since it has broken down , it tends to produce cold spots on the cavity walls so in many cases it should be removed and replaced to ensure the house is more energy efficiency . <p> Newer methods of insulation should not cause any damp unless the wall is consistently battered with high levels of driving rain , and the installer SHOULD ( although may not ) advise against it . <p> I would strongly disagree with the suggestion Urea-formaldehyde foam is easy to remove . My reasons for this is that a lot of prep work needs to be done on the property before any extraction takes placeas we use compressed air in the extraction process he foam turns to dust and will enter the property through any little cracks around windows , behind kitchen cupboards where the sink and waste pipes are . The loft is a particular problem .

By adding insulation to the- walls of your home , you reduce the U-value and in turn you will- save money on your heating- energy bills . Let see how this works . <p> The heat demand of your house depends on a number of factors such as : <p> the insulating properties of the fabric of your house , known as U-values of the walls <p> the amount of heat carried out of your house by air- movement , depending on how big your house is and the number of windows <p> the difference between the inside and outside temperatures the heat requirement for a home varies from season to season ( more heat is needed during the winter months- for example ) . <p> A better way to estimate the annual space heat consumption is to divide the heating into periods for different outside temperatures , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average outside temperature is 6oC while the inside temperature is set to- 20oC to stay comfortable . For a standard temperature difference and constant heat losses through ventilation , the amount of heating required depends on the insulation of the walls , roof and floor . In the next section- we are going to examine how insulation affects the heat transfer through the walls . <p> Common cavity walls built after 1930s consist of two layers of brick of about 100mm each separated by an air cavity of 70mm in the middle as you see in- the picture below . <h> The u-value of an Un-insulated Wall <p> Layers <p> Thickness ( m ) <p> Conductivity ( W/mK ) <p> Resistance ( Km-/W ) <p> Internal surface <p> <p> <p> 0.12 <p> 100 mm Brick <p> 0.100 <p> 1.2 <p> 0.08 <p> Air <p> 0.070 <p> <p> 0.17 <p> 100 mm Brick <p> 0.100 <p> 1.2 <p> 0.08 <p> External surface <p> <p> <p> 0.06 <p> Sum <p> 0.270 <p> <p> 0.52 <p> - - - - U value ( W/m-K ) <p> 1.94 <p> The insulation commonly used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polypearl Plus and Polypearl Platinum ) this is expanded polystyrene bead which helps to- reduce the thermal transmittance of the external cavity walls .

Smaller U-values practically means a reduction in heat loss of- 31.78W/m2 . <p> We should also take into account the air leakage of your house to estimate the heat demand of your house . For example , for an average semi-detached house of 98 m2- with a total volume of 245 m3 the heat loss coefficient is- cf = 304.02 W/K for un-insulated walls- and standard U-values for the windows , floor and roof as you see in the next table .

During the heating season , if you heat your house for 7 hours you will save about -0.0058/m2 per day . So , for the whole heating period of approximately 3 months you will save -0.524/m2 . For an average house of 98m2- this means that you save -51.35 to heat your house by adding mineral wool insulation to your solid walls . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K ) <p> Reduction of heat losses ( W/m2 ) <p> Save ( - ) <p> Mineral wool insulation <p> 0.31 <p> 14 <p> 31.78 <p> 51.35 <p> EPS insulation <p> 0.30 <p> 14 <p> 32.20 <p> 52.90 <p> In reality , in order to give a more accurate estimation of the heat demand we should take into account the heat- gains from the lights and electrical appliances of your home , and the heat produced by the occupants and the solar heat gains- mainly through windows .

@@36748877 @5748877/ <h> Thermal liner a cheaper way to insulate walls ? <h> August 20 , 2013 <h> Options to insulate the walls of your home <p> Up to 35% of heat in the home is lost through the walls , therefore insulating them will massively lower your energy bills . <p> If your home was built after 1935 , the chances are you have cavity walls ; these are insulated very easily by injecting them with cavity wall insulation . <p> Several holes are drilled in the outside of the wall , and insulating beads or wool insulation are then injected into the cavity between the two skins of brick . <p> If you live in an older house or you know that you have solid walls ( there are some exceptions to the post-- 1935 rule ) , the insulation process is a little bit trickier . <p> Basically , in this instance you need to either insulate the walls externally or- internally . <p> Insulating internal solid walls causes a lot of disruption in the home since you need to move radiators and furniture " but probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because it steals room space . <p> Both external and internal wall insulation need to be at least 100mm thick , otherwise they really are n't going to greatly improve the energy efficiency . Making your wall 100mm thicker on the inside obviously will make the room significantly smaller , especially if you need to insulate more than one wall . Hence , you might want to consider insulating using thermal liner ( sometimes referred to as thermal wallpaper ) as an alternative solution . <h> What is Thermal Liner ? <p> Thermal liner is basically a thin material that is used to help maintain heat in a room . It- is made from wood fibres interwoven with durable textile fibres . This gives you is a very strong , flexible material that when- attached to the walls is said to increase the energy efficiency of the room in question . <h> Does Thermal Liner increase the energy efficiency of walls ? <p> I used- the Wallrock KV600 Thermal Liner in my home but I think I need to set the scene a little . I have a pre-1900 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly busy road , so buses and lorries driving by have actually caused quite a few cosmetic cracks in the ageing plasterboard of one of the bedrooms . In addition , this room genuinely gets freezing in winter , but the room is n't massive so I was looking at keeping it warm without compromising on space . Thermal liner is definitely a compromise between solid wall insulation and loss of space , but it can be the best option for homes like mine , where space and energy use are at a premium . <h> Installing the Thermal Liner <p> Firstly the thermal liner is very easy to attach to the walls . Click on the link below to access the thermal liner hanging instructions <p> As recommended , - I used the specially formulated Wallrock insulation adhesive to hang it on the walls ; this is strong stuff and you need a lot of it but it does hold it in place ( although there is a bit of holding until the adhesive sets ) . It is a little strange that the adhesive comes in tubs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6kg per roll of KV600 it means that you need to go for the 10kg pack , even if you want to do just one roll , so you will have excess adhesive . <p> The- video below shows you- exactly how the Wallrock thermal liner is hung on the walls . <p> The KV600 is about twice the price of the normal Wallrock thermal liner , however the rolls are twice the size so each one covers an area of 15m2 . The main advantage for me though is that it is a little bit thicker ( 4mm as opposed to 3.2mm thick ) , which is the key to increased energy efficiency . Once it is up on the walls you can paint over it as required . <p> First of all I can confirm the thermal liner does work . However much like secondary glazing versus double glazing , - it does not provide the same level of energy efficiency as installing 100mm of internal wall insulation . It works though , and it is significantly cheaper . I required just under 2 rolls of thermal liner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials was just over -200 . To do the same job with internal wall insulation would have cost me well over -1,000 and despite increased energy efficiency , my room would have become smaller . <p> One of the added advantages of installing the Wallrock KV600 Thermal Liner was its ability to cover the cosmetic cracks in the room . - Now since I live on this busy road , large vehicles are going to continue to drive past my flat . The thermal liner has the ability to move very slightly so gone are the days of visible cracks in the room . <p> One of the things I could not accurately assess is the savings it has made on my bills . While certainly increasing the comfort of the room in question , I can not say whether there have been significant savings on my bills mainly because the bloody energy companies keep putting my bill up ! Therefore it is impossible for me to say it will pay back within a certain timescale.However I can conclusively say it does increase the energy efficiency of the walls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going round the corners of rooms with the thermal liner , I suggest cutting it as per the diagram below . <p> This ensures that the thermal liner fits more snuggly around the room ! <h> 20 comments <p> Hi I have a room lined with standard lining paper that is painted with emulsion , I have some cracks and have removed some of the paper to repair them , I have now seen the wall rock liner and would like to use this on the wall and over the lining paper , is this ok to do ? <p> Hi I need to insulate my internal walls and searching the web I have come across a product called Wallrock KV600 Thermal Liner and another one called Erfurt with 4mm thickness , . My questions are , what is the different between Wallrock KV600 and Erfurt both with 4mm thickness ?

I assume that you will be papering over the wallrock with a standard wallpaper , if so remember that anything stuck to a wall is only as good as the paste connecting it to the wall so the Erfurt Mav will need to be a suitable strength paste also . <p> I 'm considering insulating our dormer rooms which are really very cold in winter because of the flat ( read : uninsulated roof and uninsulated tiled external wall . I therefore read this with some interest . Can this be used on ceilings as well and has anyone done it with success ? Is it possible to use either 2 layers of this product to increase the insulating effect and/or could it be used as an additional layer on top of something like Sempatap ? I know this will probably sound a bit OTT but believe you me the upstairs dormer rooms are freezing and I 'm at my wits end in trying to find a cost effective solution hence the last question . <p> Any help would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information on the company website re the thermal values . Is it just me or ? <p> Hi . Weve used kv600 on all external walls of our stone house after great success in our previous home but the corners are still running in water ( condensation ) particularly along the decorators caulk seam . We have tried anti condensation paint but this does n't  seem to have fixed this . Would the aero therm work ? Could we paint it over the fibreliner ? We are working on dehumidifing the propery and ventilating too but wondered if adding aerotherm on bridge areas or corners over the kv600 and fibreliner would be effective , possible or a waste of money . Many thanks . <p> De humidifiers definietly work and a drier room atmosphere will feel warmer , we have used them for years . Internal dry lining has rendered the de humidifiers redundant . Method used horizontal batten formed air gap covered with double sided bubble foil then vertical batten formed air gap then foil backed plasterboard works really well . If the work is done DIY , cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch . The thermal liner ( KV600 ) would certainly help with this mainly because the walls would no longer be cold to touch , therefore warm moist air would n't condense on them.The paste all contains both fungicide and biocide to help stop mould . <p> I have just hung my first roll of KV600 and a good tip I found to work was use a warm electric iron over each strip it removes creases and helps the adhesive dry quicker its the first time i have ironed wall paper but it works . <p> Hi Sue , so the KV600 reduces the U-Value by about 0.4 . If you wanted to increase the efficiency further then you should look at internal solid wall insulation . We also have another product called Aero-Therm , which is applied as a gel as opposed to a wallpaper and has similar insulation qualities . The problem with a thicker wallpaper would be that the weight of it would drag it off the walls . Hope this helps . <p> Hi , I hired a decorator to hang my wallrock thermal liner kv600 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he left it became obvious that the liner was coming off the wall at almost all of the seams . What 's more worrying is that there are very clearly some quite large bubbles underneath the liner as well ( many at least 0.5m wide and quite long as well ) . It seems that the glue was not applied thickly enough or dried before the liner was stuck to the wall ( walls were sized + PVAed before the liner was applied ) . <p> The thing has not come off the wall as yet but I am worried that in might in due course as well as creating cavities for the mold to grow <p> Do you have any advice on how to proceed ? The decorator has the intention of sticking the seams back on with the reminder of the glue but I am worried about the bubbles under the liner . Should he strip it all and start from scratch ? How would he do that ? Any advice appreciated ! Cheers Kaska <p> I used the KV600 and there was a notable difference in room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You really need to use very sharp scissors or a stanley knife to cut it though otherwise the fibres snag ! <p> Also , the instructions are telling the truth about needing 5L of wallrock power adhesive per roll so make sure you use lots . <p> It is really good stuff though , this thermal liner a nice alternative to solid wall insulation . <p> Hi Paul thanks for your comment ! We used it in the spare bedroom of my home too you are quite right with regards to using a sharp knife ! It is good stuff to work with provided you cut it well , since the corners of the room need to be cut very accurately . Bending the material around corners simply does n't  work ! <p> Thanks James I thought this was a really useful read we had this installed in our lounge and it has made a very noticeable difference . Our decorator highlighted that the key to putting this on the walls was to put as much adhesive on the liner as possible to hold it firmly in place just something I thought might be useful to share ! 
@@36748878 @5748878/ <h> Storing electricity produced from your solar panels <h> December 8 , 2014 <p> Solar PV has never been as attractive as it is now . Prices are at an all time low , the feed-in tariff is making the payback excellent and the cost of mains electricity is still going up . Whilst solar generation technology has improved , the storage methods for the power you generate has lagged far behind . <p> An average home might use around 10kW/day , whilst a typical 3.5kW panel system would produce something like 10kW on a summers day and only 2.5kW on a winter day . So on the face of it , the panels would produce the majority of your energy needs , but there is a snag " for the majority of us domestic electricity consumers , we use much more electricity in the evening than during the day , and there tends to be less sun , or indeed no sun , at these all important hours . <p> We tend to use most of our electricity in the evening , after dark . <p> You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 10kW generated is used during daylight hours , but then 5kW is used after dark , powering the oven and the TV and the washing machine . You have two choices " to displace the generated energy to later in the day ( i.e. alter the supply ) , or to move the demand forward to when the energy is generated ( i.e. managing the demand ) . <h> Batteries <p> This is one way to use your generated electricity when it gets dark . There are various types of battery storage system on the market , but they all come up against several major hurdles . Firstly , any battery system would have to charge and discharge thousands of times in its life . This is beyond the capability of many batteries , and this means regular replacement . Cost of the battery is also prohibitive for many , with the cost per unit of storing the energy , all said and done , being more than the cost of just using grid electricity . <h> Working with the grid <p> Instead of storing the energy you create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now for most people , who do n't have an export meter , it is assumed that you export 50% of your generated energy back to the grid anyway , but for those who actually use even less than this , it might be worth installing an export meter and getting more from the exported electricity . If you tend to be away from home a lot in the summer for example , this could be worth considering . Unfortunately the export tariff is rather low , so you are n't likely to see big returns via this route . If you can , you should try to utilise the energy rather than exporting it , as the cost per unit is around three times the export tariff . <h> Soft storage <p> What is becoming much more popular now is what is called soft storage ' . This means that instead of storing the excess energy you generate in the form of electricity , you can store it in other mediums . <p> productbox id= " 10060 ? /productbox <p> Using a diverter like the Apollo Gem or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generating in your immersion tank or your storage heaters for use later in the day . They are far cheaper than batteries and if used effectively can save you just as much energy as batteries can . This should be one of your first options before considering a more expensive battery system . <h> Manage Supply or Demand <p> By far the cheapest option is going to be managing your demand for electricity . By trying to use your appliances during the middle of the day , you will save considerably over the course of a year . Storing energy is always going to more expensive and I would advise against it in most cases . <p> There is a solution in place , in Germany , now . Hydrogen is produced using the excess power which is then injected into the gas grid for later use . Thuga Group in Frankfurt have just hailed their year long trial a resounding success and guess what it is a British company that manufactures the equipment , ( ITM Power ) . Our National grid is actively looking for three hundred sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is large scale but it is happening now . In the future when we have fuel cell heat and power units instead of gas boilers our solar roofs will produce hydrogen which we will store and use as and when we want to use it . <p> I was keen to get some batteries integrated into my solar PV install so I could maximise what I used . I got a couple of quotes and could n't believe it the battery kit was the same price as the solar to install in the first place . I think the hot water immersion things are the way to go to store the excess solar energy . <p> I suspect market forces will drive the evolution of electricity storage in the near term . Until that happens I use ordinary timers . Cheap and easy to set up , they can be set to take maximum advantage of solar panel output for devices like washing machines and tumble dryers , phasing their switch-on times so they draw current sequentially .

@@36748879 @5748879/ <h> Biomass Energy <h> Renewables <h> What is biomass energy ? <p> Biomass is biological material derived from living or recently living organisms . In the context of biomass energy , this is often used to mean plant based material , but biomass can equally apply to both animal and vegetable derived material . The carbon used to construct biomass is absorbed from the atmosphere as carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) by plant life , using energy from the sun . Plants may subsequently be eaten by animals and thus converted into animal biomass , but the primary absorption is performed by plants . This is however the basis of biomass energy , which in essence is the capture of the sun 's energy that is stored in living organisms.h <p> Fossil fuels on the other hand offer high energy density , but making use of that energy involves burning the fuel , with the oxidation of the carbon to carbon dioxide and burning the hydrogen to produce water ( vapour ) . Unless these emissions are captured and stored ( see- CCS ) , then these combustion products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of years ago and thus contributing to increased atmospheric concentrations . <h> How is biomass energy different to fossil fuel energy ? <p> The vital difference between biomass and fossil fuels is one of time scale . Biomass takes carbon out of the atmosphere- while it is growing , and returns it back to the atmosphere- as it is burned . If it is managed on a sustainable basis , biomass is harvested as part of a constantly replenished crop . Forms of replenishment are as follows : ( 1 ) woodland or arboriculture management or ( 2 ) coppicing or ( 3 ) as part of a continuous programme of replanting with any new growth taking up CO2- from the atmosphere . This maintains a closed carbon cycle with no net increase in atmospheric CO2- levels , which means the release into the atmosphere by combustion is absorbed by new growth . <h> Biomass energy for your business <p> The main difference between biomass boilers and fossil fuel-fired systems is that biomass energy systems are larger . The heating system itself works in a very similar way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the following : a boiler , control system , mechanical system ( pipes , valves , flues etc. ) , infrastructure to receive and store fuel and infrastructure to transfer it to the main boiler unit . <h> Heat energy <p> Biomass energy is extracted using biomass fuel , which is burnt in a combustion chamber and the heat is then used to heat water . This hot water then heats the building through a normal hot water heating system . Steam can also be used in industrial processes where appropriate , and hot air is sometimes used for space heating . However unlike electricity generation , which is subsidised by the ROCs , the- Renewable Heat Incentive- ( RHI ) is not yet in place to help subsidise district- renewable heating solutions . <h> Electricity <p> For generating electricity , the steam produced can be used to power turbines , which then runs an electric generator and creates power . As biomass energy is part of the renewable fuel grouping for electricity generation , users can now also benefit from Renewables Obligation Certificates ( ROCs ) , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power generated . <p> Biomass energy plants can vary from being small , manually-fed systems with basic controls , to fully automatic systems with advanced controls and remote monitoring . You should always consider fuel availability and consistency , as well as storage and handling , during the design , implementation and operation stages . Of all possible renewable heating solutions , biomass energy has the potential to deliver some of the most significant and cost-effective carbon savings , particularly for commercial and industrial applications . In addition to carbon savings , biomass energy also offers significant benefits for users , including operational fuel cost savings and reduced fuel price volatility . <p> A biomass energy plant in a small town or village for example can stimulate local economic activity by creating fuel supply chains and making good use of resources that would otherwise be treated as waste and sent to landfill . <h> ROCs for biomass energy electricity generation <p> As mentioned in the previous section if you have a biomass energy system , then depending on the power output , the system can be eligible for ROCs if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends upon the biomass generation type . According to the Department for Energy and Climate Change ( DECC ) , if the electricity generated is partly from fossil fuel and partly from biomass , then it is entitled to 0.5 ROCs per MWh . Dedicated biomass generation is applicable for 1.5 ROCs per MWh . The use of energy crops mixed with fossil fuel or CHP ( cogeneration ) process entitles the generator from 1 ROC to 2 ROCs depending on the mixture . Pure energy crop electricity entitles the generator to 2 ROCs per MWh . <p> Do you have the capital to invest in such a system ? Biomass energy solutions tend to have higher capital costs than fossil fuel-fired systems , but can attract financial support schemes . <h> Sourcing fuel for biomass energy <p> The three most common types of commercially available biomass fuels are wood-based ( logs , woodchips and pellets ) . However , other fuels such as straw are also used as part of the biomass energy grouping . <p> Biomass energy fuel supply needs to be sustainable in principle , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope by purchasing biomass fuel from many suppliers , and you can make long-term agreements to secure a fixed price into the future . If you can source the fuel locally then you will also have more control over the security of your supply . - This will also increase your on-site storage giving you that buffer against short-term supply problems . <p> It is common practice to undersize the biomass boiler and to include a thermal store ( large hot water tank ) . This helps to smooth the heat demand profile and ensures that the biomass boiler runs for long hours at high load . An auxiliary fossil fuel fired boiler is then used to cope with peak loads . This multi-fuel strategy gives greater security against fuel problems too , but is not as good for the environment . <h> Industry policy trends for Biomass Energy <p> The take up of biomass energy in electricity generation in the UK , and its long-term outlook , is mixed . For example , companies like- Drax Power- and- E.ON- have moved away from their initial enthusiasm for expansion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome of the- Renewables Obligation- ( RO ) review . However , the government has signalled on more than one occasion that the banding will expand , so as to further support CHP initiatives . For this reason the industry is waiting for more details to emerge on the Renewable Heat Incentive due to launch later in 2012 / early 2013 . <h> Benefits <p> Return on your investment in three years if the biomass replaces electric , fuel oil or LPG . <p> Net carbon emissions per kilowatt hour ( kWh ) are much lower than energy sources from fossil fuels . E.g. The carbon emissions for woodchip are 10-23kg of CO2 per megawatt hour ( MWh ) , compared to 263-302kgCO2/MWh for natural gas . <p> Biomass systems are relatively easy to convert to other fuels and offer greater flexibility for an uncertain energy future . <p> In some regions biomass are considered waste products ; burning them for energy can reduce disposal costs and free up landfill sites . 184564 @qwx384564 <p> Biomass plant will typically cost two to five times as much as an equivalently sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite as fast if you 're replacing natural gas .

@@36748885 @5748885/ <h> Renewables to heat your swimming pool <h> April 22 , 2014 <p> Swimming pools are no doubt a luxury item for the few in the country that can afford them . This is not only due to the cost of installing one , but perhaps just as importantly the cost of running one throughout the year . Heating the volume of water contained within a swimming pool can come at great cost . This often limits their usage to just a couple of months during the summer . <p> This does n't have to be the case though , as renewable technologies and energy efficient heating methods dramatically reduce the running costs . This allows the swimming pools to be used for a longer duration throughout the year , at a reduced price and also makes them a more attractive product . <p> In this blog , we look at the common misconceptions of heating patterns , the efficiency and cost of oil and gas for swimming pool heating as well as new technologies , which provide much better alternatives . <h> Heating patterns <p> The first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heated in the winter , while indoor pools may be heated all year around . <p> The thing to bear in mind is that the difference between temperature of the water and the external ambient temperature determines exactly how much energy is required to heat the pool . <p> For an outdoor pool , in the winter when the outside temperature is lower , the pool will lose heat more quickly . Conversely in the summer , where the water temperature and the outside temperature are relatively well matched , less heating will be required . <p> In this case it makes very little sense trying to heat an outdoor pool in the winter since the pool will lose the heat almost as quickly as you heat it ! The ability to heat the pool should more be used to prolong the swimming season , by potentially adding a month at the beginning and a month at the end of the season . <p> For an indoor pool it is slightly different , since the heating requirement depends on the actual usage of the pool itself . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend , then there is no point in keeping the heating on throughout the week . The amount of energy required for water heating and the heat loss of the pool are directly correlated . <p> As a result you may want to ensure that the inefficient gas and oil boilers only start heating on Friday night and switch off on the Sunday to keep heating costs down . Even if you are heating all week , it is really important to use a swimming pool cover to help keep that heat in and reduce the amount of heating required . <p> If you have a renewable heating systems for the swimming pool , such as Solar Thermal , then it becomes much more feasible to maintain the swimming pool 's temperature at around 28 degrees . <h> Solar thermal for your swimming pool <p> Solar thermal , or solar hot water , is an entirely free source of hot water using the sun 's rays . With no operating costs , easy installation and high durability , solar thermal provides excellent water heating . However , there are drawbacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on cloudy days the temperature of the water may not be hot enough to use them as the sole heating source . <p> This means that , although they are the ideal solution for swimming pool heating in warmer areas , they should only really be used as additional heating in less sunny environments . You should not be dissuaded from them however , as they are still a great cost saving technology , but just one that may not be able to run independently of other heat sources . <h> Heat pumps for swimming pools <p> The most efficient way to heat your swimming pool is through a heat pump . The technology is much like an air conditioner , but in reverse . The heat pump requires electricity in order to achieve the required temperature , however they are able to exchange 1 unit of electricity to 5 units of heat due to their high efficiency . Whereas heat pumps for domestic hot water require the temperature to reach around 50 degrees , swimming pool heat pumps do not require the temperature to reach anything more than 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500% efficiency compared to perhaps only 300% for domestic heat pumps and highlights how much this technology could save when compared to gas and oil counterparts . <p> The heat pump can be used as a standalone heating system for the pool , however savings will be increased even further when the heat pump is use in conjunction with solar thermal technology . A swimming pool heat pump is also significantly less expensive than a household pump and will pay back very quickly if you are off gas grid . Whilst it probably is n't worth switching to a heat pump from a gas boiler , if you are installing from new it is a very attractive option . <h> Can you get the RHI for a swimming pool heat pump ? <p> For a heat pump that is solely for the purpose of heating a swimming pool , the renewable heat incentive- is not available . However , when a heat pump that is currently supplying domestic hot water is used to also heat the swimming pool , the pump IS eligible for the RHI . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat demands of the swimming pool . <h> What are the numbers ? <p> Taking a 15 x 30ft pool that takes- 74.4 kw per day to heat ( 10048 kw per season of 135 days ) . <p> Gas -600 to heat per season <p> Oil -900 to heat per season <p> Electric heater -2500 to heat per season <p> Heat Pump -500 to heat per season <p> Solar thermal savings obviously depend on how much sun it receives , but expect to see around 60% of the heating carried out for free by the solar thermal . Based on an install cost of -4,000 for a 15x30ft pool , you could see returns in under 10 years if you are currently relying on oil ( or just a few years for electricity ) to heat the pool . <p> So bear in mind renewables if you are looking to heat a swimming pool . There are some fantastic options out there that will save you money .

Originally , I was led to believe I had an extra 12 months free BG Homecare at the end of my one year warranty . As it turns out , the free Homecare started the day my boiler was installed , which did n't  make sense to me at all . As a protest , I decided not to continue the Homecare package with BG , as I thought I thought that I could rely on the 5 year warranty from Worcester . Today , my 17 month old Worcester 24Ri boiler broke down and the Worcester customer service rep told me that I am not covered by the usual 5 year warranty as the boiler was installed by BG , and they had agreed to reduce the 5 year warranty to only 1 year . This was not pointed out to me at the time of the contract with BG . I will seek legal advice tomorrow as I think I should have a case either against Worcester or BG for agreeing to reduce the warranty to only 1 year . <p> You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out is that the 5 or 10 year Guarantee from Manufacturer is on valid if you have the British Gas care 100 which will be over -100 a year . The Flue is Free when you buyer a New Boiler and they charge you -200 . Installation charge of -1000.00 does not include the Electrics , They charge an additional -200 for the Electrician to do their bit of work . There is no -400 saving at all . <p> Getting quotes is always advisable for any large purchase . You also have to make sure you are comparing like for like quotes as if its too cheap you have to ask why , the average boiler on a wall cost is around -1800 -2000 . We can help get 3 quotes arranged pretty quick and we often see savings of over 50% when comparing quotes from local and national installers . <p> Agreed getting 3 quotes is a good idea , that is why we suggest giving us a call ! We have a huge network of installers across the country all of whom can install any boiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All our partners are gas safe and the majority are installing these heating systems under the GDHIF scheme . <p> If you generally get 3 quotes you end up RECEIVING top notch prices once each tradesman know there are other people after your business . Meaning you get great deal in the end . It always worked . But if you get 4 price estimates it just gets better and better . = <p> All of these comments above are hilarious . I have used british gas for my boiler installation and they were competitive after getting 2 other quotes from Swale and A C Wilgar and they beat both . The company above are having to use another companys name negatively to try and get customers . The fact is british gas are probably more expensive than locals but there service and aftercare ca n't be beaten .

It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say it ! British gas are always more expensive for boilers than local companies , but local installers can offer the same warranties on the whole . In fact the aftercare is an f-ing joke . Homecare is -20 a month , for a boiler that has a 7 year parts and labour warranty ? ! What the hell ! That is -20 x 12 x 7 wasted ( -1680 ) which would pay for a new boiler anyway . <p> Also talking about tight people , it is stupid people like yourself that keeps British gas in business ! You think they actually employ everyone of their engineers or have you ever considered that the majority of them are actually subbies ! This means they pay to install under the BG brand and therefore can charge a premium to do so . Whether or not they do a good job is another question . <p> I used to work for BG and I can tell you the whole business model they offer is to make money . That means they will put their name to anything to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiler does n't  make it any good , but why not slap on an extra few hundred quid ! ! ! <p> Yep It is amazing how many people do just that Andrew it is what we suggest to be honest , getting British Gas to come and take a look ! <p> The other thing we need to do is to warn people off their Home Care service . The warranty that comes with a new boiler gives the home owner protection so if they went for a vaillant or Worcester boiler installed by one of the manafacturers approved installers , they would get a 7 year warranty so they are completely protected for many people that would save about -200 per year ! <p> Hi think British gas are a bloody rip off and people need to know ! They sold me that monthly servicing thing they offer but when I had trouble with the boiler I had to call them out . Despite them saying it is free for call outs , they charged me after the third time . It is disgusting , people should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5+ year warranties anyway ! <p> BG installed my Worcester boiler less than two years ago . I decided not to extend the homecare service as it was over-20 a month . My boiler has broken down but Worcester says I am not entitled to the 5 year warranty as BG has asked them to reduce the warranty to only one year . WHY ? Now I am not covered by either Worcester or BG . Do I have a case against either Worcester or BG for not honouring the 5 year warranty ? 
@@36748887 @5748887/ <h> Spray foam insulation FAQ <h> December 16 , 2013 <h> What is spray foam insulation ? <p> Spray foam insulation is a type of insulation that can be used in the roof space at either the joist or rafter level , to help keep warm air in the home during the winter and also prevent the home getting too warm in the summer . <p> Typically , the spray foam is made up of polyurethane . It is sprayed as a liquid , which then gradually expands to up to 100 times its original volume , and once set it not only creates an effective insulating layer , it also acts to reduce noise pollution . <h> Can I install spray foam myself ? <p> Spray foam insulation ideally needs to be installed by a professional , since it gives off dangerous fumes and also can actually damage the structural integrity of the building if applied incorrectly . <p> The reason for this is that the expanding foam can exert some serious pressure on the home 's structure if applied incorrectly and ceilings and walls have been known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is open cell and closed cell spray foam ? <p> Foam structures consist of a flexible material that is filled with bubbles of gas ( or just air ) . There are two main types of spray foam , closed cell and open cell . <p> In closed cell foams , the bubbles are encompassed entirely in the liquid . When the foam sets , each bubble forms a trapped discrete pocket of gas . In an open cell foam , the bubbles all merge with one another , so a gas can travel through the foam ( imagine a bathroom sponge ) . <p> This gives the two different types of foams different properties . <h> Features of closed cell spray foam <p> This spray foam sets rock hard " it is not compressible when it has set , this means that it can help support the structure of the property . However if installed incorrectly it can exert unnecessary strain on the structure of the home . This type of foam will also tend to be much denser as a result and this also means it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spray foam tend to be greater than the open cell spray foam , partly because they can put bubbles of insulating gas in the foam ( not just air ) . This helps slow the movement of heat across the foam . <p> The typical U-value for closed cell spray foam is about 0.16 W/m2K <p> The final thing about closed cell spray foam is that it will not allow moisture across it , which means that you will need to consider ventilation in the loft space to prevent build up of condensation . <h> Features of open cell spray foam <p> Open cell spray foam is less dense than close cell spray foam , so it will not help strengthen the structure of the building . In addition , its chemical makeup means that it does n't offer the same level of insulating effectiveness as the closed cell . However on the plus side it has high vapour permeability allowing it to breath far better than the closed cell spray , so condensation build-up should be less of an issue . The other major benefit is that it offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequency ranges . <p> The typical U-value of open cell spray foam is about 0.35 W/m2K <p> Since spray foam has better insulating properties than wool ( when the same thickness is used ) , you can achieve the same U-value by insulating to a greater- depth . This means that if space is an issue ( remember you need to install 270mm of wool insulation to meet building regulations now ) , then spray foam could be the answer . Typically you will require a depth of 150mm to achieve a u-value of 0.16 W/m2K , but a depth of just 40mm will help you to achieve a u-value of 0.40 W/m2K . <h> What should I expect to pay for spray foam insulation ? <p> Spray foam insulation is not cheap " while using mineral insulation might cost -6-7 per m2 to achieve a u-value of 0.16 W/m2K , spray foam might cost -45 per m2 to achieve the same value . <h> Are there any issues with insulating my loft with spray foam ? <p> So having mentioned all the positives relating to spray foam insulation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product to insulate the loft space that we should draw your attention to and that is ventilation . <p> If the spray foam is applied to the undersides of roof slates or tiles , it is not possible to keep this ventilation gap , since the foam encapsulates the roofing battens and the top of the rafters , trapping moisture . As you can read here , we think it is really important that you leave a ventilated gap between any insulation and the tiles in order to vent away any moisture otherwise the wood ca n't breathe and it will consequently begin to rot . A new roof is not a cheap thing to install ! <p> That being said , if the wooden rafters are treated properly first and it is installed correctly , it is certainly worth considering , although if you want a more sustainable product to insulate with ( remember polyurethane is derived from crude oil ) then take a look here ! <p> An alternative is AeroTherm insulating paste . Just 1mm can prevent up to 35% of heat loss from rooms . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spray foam my loft , I was told that the work men will remove the felt before they spray the foam directly onto the roof tiles , is this correct ? I am a little concerned about this . <p> I had foam insulation applied in year 2000 . This year I applied for an Equity Release package and was refused because of the foam insulation , which they said would have to be removed and the roof tiles replaced . What is your opinion of this , please ? <p> It may be one of their requirements it really depends on the property type . This type of insulation can lock in damp , but there are still companies out there doing it ( and some are charging unbelievable sums ) . I would be wary and always give us a call if in doubt ! <p> I just want to reply to earlier comments . Regarding the cost of Spray Foam Insulation , there are many re-sellers of spray foam , as there are with many other products e.g. lead agencies who will charge way above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be advised to go directly to the company who manufacture or install the product for a fair price ! <p> Also , there are two different types of spray foam , One is " closed cell " ( waterproof ) foam for use in roof repair or foundations or walls , When installed as a roof repair system , it is usually for roofs as a last resort before replacement and will add 10-30 years to a roof , depending on the condition of the roof . It is sprayed directly to the underside of the roof tile/slate , As a roof repair system it is used to hold the tiles/slate in place , prevent water ingress and to provide insulation against heat loss . This product has seen many advancements in the past decades and is not the same as products installed 15 or even 25 years ago . Hence the reason that it is not banned for installation in cavity walls . <p> The other type is " open cell " breathable foam , which when installed in a roof is only sprayed to roofing membranes such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprayed directly to tile/slate , is used to make the roof airtight and to provide significant insulation against heat loss . <p> Martin Hancox is trying to win the debate by not answering or pointing out Spray Foam obvious drawbacks . Readers need only Google " Spray Foam Makes House Unliveable " , to learn the truth , or for actual photos go on Google Images and search for Spray Foam Botched Jobs . On the web there 's one guy stating the foam he got was only 1/4 1/2 inch thick in parts , when he complained he was informed " it was a new guys first job and they would come back and rectify it " . They did n't  . The real beef is the prices charged , I 've heard of -3500.00 for a small semi-detached house being common , the public need to know that it costs -4000.00 to re-roof and re-tile it completely with all new tiles , In my local papers jobs were being offered to sell Spray Foam , average commission stated was -750.00 per deal . It ended you can earn over -100k @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product , it was outlawed in the UK for Cavity Walls about 25 years ago , and the bad Press Reports crippled this W C Fields there 's a mug born every minute business . <p> ROOFS INSULATED WITH FOAM FAIL when you wish to move on and sell your house the new buyers Building Society Surveyors report and roof condition requirements . So when you place your house on the market @ -195k or nearest offer and find a buyer he soon drops out when he s told the house needs a complete new roof , and the report highlights the bodged spray foam job as the reason why . Many buyers bounce back with an reduced offer , they want -10 000 discount of the price , or else . <p> A majority of spray foams staff spray the foam all over the place , then they tidy the job up afterwards by trimming off the excess foam globules using an electric foam knife , or an hedge cutter . My advice is too never buy a house with foam in the loft , and keep well away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foam insulation . Caveat Emptor applies , and you can not sue for damages . <p> Open cell Icynene has global presence in 30 countries including 16 countries in Europe and is the insulation of choice for a lot of major new builds . Icynene is backed by the BBA . New technology is often met with fear but this product will be the only insulation to be used in future years . <p> Just had icynene spray foam installed under suspended floor by a qualified installer . It has made absolutely no difference . Still cold floors , still the feeling of cold air rushing around at floor level , still air infiltration at skirting boards and gaps in floorboards ; I had to get the silicone gun out again and start filling in the gaps . Save your money , it does n't  really work . The only thing that works is not building crap houses in the first place . 
@@36748888 @5748888/ <h> How many solar panels can I fit on my roof ? <h> July 4 , 2014 <p> Solar panels are now an affordable way to reduce your demand on the electric grid by producing your own electricity . That is without even taking into account the Feed-in Tariff , which pays you for every unit of electricity created , regardless of whether you use it in the home or sell it back to the grid . <h> How big a system ? <p> With a 3.5kw system now costing about -6,500 and annual returns of -800 plus , getting solar PV panels installed really is an attractive investment opportunity . <p> The key to making the numbers work though is maximising the number of panels you can squeeze onto your roof , because regardless of the size of system , you are still going to need things like inverters and cabling to run through the home , so the actual cost of adding an extra panel is not really going to add that much to the final cost of the system . <p> Most solar panels are 250 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watts ) system you would need 14 panels . <p> 250 watt solar PV panels are all pretty much a standardised size " they are around 1.6m x 0.9m and about 5cm thick . <p> For example the Suntech 250w monocrystalline panel is 1665mm x 991mm x 50mm , whhereas the Sanyo/Panasonic panel is 1610mm x 861mm x 35mm , but broadly speaking they are all in that range . Therefore when sizing your solar PV system we recommend using this to drive your calculations . <p> With a panel therefore being approximately 1.44m2 in total , to get 14 panels on a roof you need a space of about 20m2 . However roof-mounted solar installations must also be more than 30cm away from the external edge of the roof , meaning that actually you will need- an even larger space so this needs to be factored in to any roof sizing calculations . <h> Shading and orientation <p> Your panels will need to be positioned on a South ( or South-East to South-West ) facing roof .

In this case you should- try to position the solar panels out of this shading to maximise the amount of electricity you can create " again this might diminish the amount of roof space you have . <p> In terms of calculating the actual roof space that you have , it is relatively simple to do this if you have access to the loft space . Essentially you need to take 3 measurements to do this . <p> Measure the height from the highest point of the roof , vertically down to the joists ( assuming this is the apex ) . <p> Measure the distance from the apex horizontally to the eaves of the roof at joist level . <p> Measure the length of the apex of the roof . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of GCSE maths to calculate the area of your roof . <p> STEP 1 : <p> A2 + B2 = X2 <p> STEP 2 : <p> Once you calculate X2 , you need to square root it " to give you X. <p> X gives you the distance from the apex down to the edge of the roof . <p> STEP 3 : <p> C x X = AREA OF ROOF <p> Multiplying C by X will give the area of roof space available . You also need to deduct the 30cm around the edge of the roof on which the panels can not be fitted " this area will depend on the type of property " detached , terraced etc . <h> Flat roofs <p> If you have a flat roof , the panels will usually be mounted at an angle to maximise efficiency .

Prior to laying the anything on the solid floor , you first need to insulate the envelope of the house ( loft , walls and floors ) . This is an absolute must before starting the installing of the underfloor heating system . As mentioned they work at lower temperatures than conventional heating systems so it is imperative the heat the produce does n't escape , so we strongly recommend doing the insulation first , otherwise your new heating solution could essentially not work . <p> The first photos shows a roll of water proof membrane , which is laid out on the concrete floor . This acts as a vapour barrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 2 . Having put this in place you can then install polystyrene boards like Celotex or Kingspan of variable thickness . The precise thickness of boards installed can vary from 25mm of insulation to 150mm of insulation . However on concrete floors the more insulation you put in , the more room height you sacrifice , although obviously the less heat will escape into the ground . It is vital that you do n't run the underfloor heating coils directly onto the concrete floor without first laying insulation otherwise the majority of the heat will be lost into the ground . <p> In the photo below I made out the thickness to be 75mm , which was added throughout the ground floor area . <p> 3 . The next step is to install the heating pipes , which are then fixed to the top of the insulation boards as shown on the photo below . These underfloor coils need to be aligned close enough together to ensure there are no cold spots under the floor . <p> 4 . This is then followed by a layer of screed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is placed over the pipework to protect the pipes from collapsing when people stand or furniture is laid on the floor . To provide adequate protection and to ensure the floor is n't too hot , the coils have to be buried within 65mm of screed . <p> 5 . A range of floor finishes can be applied to the screed layer including tiles , veneer or wooden boards . This entirely depends on your taste and preference . In my property example the home owner went for a carpeted finish , which meant carpet underlay went in before the carpet was rolled out . <h> Underfloor heating with Renewables <p> It is also worth mentioning that underfloor heating works especially well with renewable heating solutions like air source heat pumps or solar thermal since they produce hot water at lower temperatures than traditional gas fired central heating systems . In addition since they are producing hot water at minimum cost once they have been installed they really do make the running of the underfloor heating system very economical . <p> If you have had a heat pump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us a ring to see if you could benefit from the Renewable Heat Premium Payment which is a cashback incentive to help fund the installation of renewable heating solutions .

Can you suggest any suitable methods that avoid this problem ? Many thanks <p> Hello , I want to know how well underground heating would work with a finished polished concrete floor ? I was told the concrete could crack in time , do you know anything about this ? And also would it be as effective heat wise using concrete as to using liquid screed ?

This maybe the case if you have a spare room that you do not heat during the winter to help save on your energy bills . <h> How can I draught-proof around the door frame ? <p> The first step is to fit a brush strip to the bottom of the doorframe , as this is where the largest gap tends to be between the door and the frame .

It is important to measure the door when it is closed , as the fixed brush strip may otherwise stop the door shutting . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hacksaw .

The foam strips tend to come attached with a self-adhesive surface , so prior to fitting them to the door , you need to clean the door surface with soapy water ( and let it dry ) to ensure the foam strip sticks properly . <p> The brush strips tend to be a lot smaller than those used at the bottom of the door , so again they tend to come with a self-adhesive surface to stick them to the door , but in some cases you will be required to screw them in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door do not hinder the memory ' or bounce-back-ability ' of the seal .

By applying the releasing agent in the correct places , the closed door can actually be used as a temporary mould for the sealant before it sets . <h> How can I draught-proof a keyhole ? <p> Draughts may also enter the property via keyholes within doors .

@@36748891 @5748891/ <h> How do you insulate a loft conversion ? <h> May 9 , 2014 <p> With all the demands on space and the value of homes rising rapidly , loft conversions are becoming a great way to expand the floor space of your home and increase its value . As you might know , the roof is one of the key places where heat is lost in the home , so ensuring it is very well insulated is absolutely essential . Here we will discuss what you can do if you have a roof room and need insulation , and how this can complicate the matter ! <h> Roof room building regulations <p> Over the years , building regulations have become ever more strict ; this has meant that roof rooms converted more than 10 years ago are unlikely to meet current standards . Furthermore , the standards prior to 2003 were actually fairly poor and chances are that if your conversion was done some time ago , there is very little insulation installed . <p> Currently , building regulations for loft conversions dictate that the u-value of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thick 270mm layer of fibre or wool insulation , about 175mm of rigid board insulation or around 125mm of high performance spray foam . If you are getting a loft converted now , your builder should be installing at least up to these standards . <p> Further , if you have a roof room and are looking to re-roof , you must ensure that the new building regulations of 0.18W/m2 are followed . Fortunately , insulation can usually be added externally , between the roof room ceiling and the new roof , during the process of re-roofing . <h> Should I retrofit insulation ? <p> Insulating a standard loft is really straightforward and will save you a lot on your energy bills . Unfortunately , to insulate a loft conversion , - which needs to be retrofitted , can be really expensive and it may not be viable for other practical reasons . <p> There are 3 areas that we can identify that will need insulating to ensure your house is up to standard : <p> The residual loft space " This is the joist area that does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as a storage area and is easily accessible . You can insulate this area in the same way to would insulate a standard loft " by laying wool insulation between the joists . This is cheap and straight forward . <p> The stud walls " These are the small walls at the end of the sloping ceiling . You can insulate these by stapling wool insulation or adding rigid boards . Again this is relatively straight forward and inexpensive . <p> The sloping roof " This is usually the largest area of the roof room and unfortunately the most difficult to insulate . This will be an expensive job whatever the approach and is unlikely to pay back very quickly . <p> So the first thing you should do is try to insulate the easy to reach places like the residual space and the stud wall . You can potentially DIY this and it will pay back very quickly . <h> Insulating the sloping roof internally or externally ? <p> If you do wish to insulate the sloping roof there are two ways you can go about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof " which can be done by either taking down the ceiling or taking the tiles off the property ( re-roofing ) . So if you are in the process of re-roofing , it makes sense to get the insulation done , otherwise this will be cost prohibitive . <p> The other , cheaper option would be to insulate internally , by adding another layer to the ceiling . This is effectively a stud wall with insulation between . This option is often not practical because it restricts the height of the room in a space that is usually already somewhat restricted . <p> So roof room insulation is great if you have it , but retrofitting it is clearly costly and impractical for many . If it is not something you will be able to do in the near future , do ensure that the easy to insulate areas we have discussed are insulated and you have made all those low cost savings you can . <h> Installing loft insulation <p> map . 184568 @qwx384568 <p> Interested in having loft insulation installed ? 184572 @qwx384572 <p> Interesting article and an interesting illustration .

Does anyone know how i find out what the building reg standards for loft insulation in January 2006 were ? Thanks <p> Peter , You have a few options available for the sloping area of the roof the best option if money is not too tight is to take the ceiling down , insulate and put a new ceiling up a few thousand pounds worth of work . If that is out of your price range , you can put insulation on the internal wall , but that will lose you headroom , which is usually at a premium in roof rooms . You could try some insulating wallpaper like Wallrock thermal liner or Aerotherm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still make it a bit warmer 
@@36748892 @5748892/ <h> Do radiator reflectors work ? <h> November 17 , 2014 <p> Radiator reflectors work on a very simple principle . You radiator radiates heat both into the room , and into the wall behind it . That heat can simply be lost to the outside , especially if you have thin single skin walls . Reflectors are installed behind the radiator and help prevent that heat from being lost by reflecting the heat back into the room . <h> Why shouldnt you use foil for radiator reflectors ? <p> There are a couple of reasons to use an approved material like Radflek . This approved material does not crinkle and crease like standard kitchen foil " it stays shiny and flat , in the ideal position to reflect heat . Foil can also oxidise over time as it is exposed to the environment , and this reduces its reflective properties , whereas radiator reflectors are treated with a chemical to prevent oxidisation . Putting kitchen foil behind the radiator is a false economy , as its effectiveness will be severely limited by these effects over time . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Radflek will make the most difference is in exposed areas of the property where the radiator is situated on an exterior wall . Internal walls are not heat loss walls , and therefore you wo n't save any heat by installing reflectors there . Party walls between properties normally do n't need reflectors either , unless your next door neighbours do n't heat the house , or there is no one living there ! <h> FROM -16.29 <p> The type of radiator itself is usually unimportant , as reflectors will work with almost any radiator , as long as there is a space to fit the reflector in behind it . <h> How much difference do radiator reflectors- make ? <p> There was a BRE report considering Radflek radiator reflectors recently . The breakdown is very interesting : <p> Type of Property <p> Savings per radiator / yr ( 0.6sqm ) <p> Payback ( Years ) <p> Insulated Cavity Walls <p> -0.80 <p> 3.7 <p> Post 1983 Cavity Walls <p> -1.32 <p> 2.3 <p> 1976-82 Cavity Walls <p> -1.91 <p> 1.6 <p> Pre 1976 Cavity Walls <p> -2.75 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These figures are taken from an independent body 's research and we can see that the savings although small , stack up very well when you consider the low cost of the Radflek . In fact , I would go as far as saying that it makes sense for pretty much anyone to install Radflek , even those with well insulated cavity walls " the installation is so easy and the payback reasonably good , so there is no reason not to . <h> It really does pay to have radiator reflectors ! <p> If you have 5 radiators on exposed walls in your property , you could be looking at savings of about -20 a year , that is payback in under 2 years . Even in a well insulated property , you would save around -5 a year paying back in 6-8 years . <p> With many other efficiency measures , you could be put off by looks , difficulty to install , or upfront cost . Radflek costs just -19.99 for a 3 radiator pack , is a simple DIY installation , and is n't noticeable once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 comments <p> " approved material does not crinkle and crease like standard kitchen foil " it stays shiny and flat , in the ideal position to reflect heat . Foil can also oxidise over time as it is exposed to the environment .. " Aluminium reflects away from the wall whether crinkled or flat and aluminium oxidises on exposure to ordinary moist air within milliseconds. ( which is why it is so difficult to solder to aluminium ) However a build up of dust will suppress its reflectivity as indeed it will on the product ( Radflek ) you are trying to sell . I recommend gluing kitchen foil to an insulating backing and clipping this so it may be removed occasionally for cleaning . <p> Do the panel heaters have fans on them ? If so , then no as the heat is blown out by the fan to help heat the room more effectively ! If there is no fan and heat is also coming out the back of the unit , then these reflectors would certainly help ! <p> I went to a tradeshow in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The guy there seemed very knowledgable although I guess he was a salesman , anyway apparantly the difference between radflek and other radiator reflectors is the fact that they do n't  oxidise over time becuase of the way they are constructed . This theory is therefore that these will keep reflecting the heat back into the room a lot longer than any DIY radiator reflector . I bought them for 6 rads and although I have only just turned the heating on they do seem to warm up the room a bit quicker . Not sure what the payback is like and I guess it is incredibly hard to acurately calculate but with energy bills going up I guess we should all be trying every option ! <p> Hi Chris , Radflek is indeed a great little product . We have seen studies by BRE that show a payback period of about 3-4 years for an old solid brick house , which is pretty impressive really for a simple little product like this that needs no maintenance . The Difference between Radflek and other radiator reflectors is that it coated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintains its reflective ability . <p> I tried to use Redflek and YES I can confirm that Redflex does work as advertised but I was put off by its looks so when I moved into my new house I immediately removed the plasterboard from behind all my radiator that are on a outside wall , which are 5 and then I improved the insulation to make sure there would be little or no loss of heat through the outside walls . I have since replaced all my radiator with column radiators and I now have a house that loses less heat through my outside walls , the heat in my radiator stays warm longer and my gas condensing boiler comes on very seldom . Finally I invested in a Heat Genius Smart Intelligent Heating Control that are already saving me over -400 annually in gas heating cost . 
@@36748893 @5748893/ <h> Do solar panels increase house value ? <h> February 9 , 2015 <p> You might be thinking about buying a house with solar PV already installed , or you might have solar PV on your roof and you are looking to sell your property . <p> In the article below we look at whether solar PV increases the value of the home and some of the factors at play . <h> Does solar PV really increase the value of my home ? <p> Solar PV is still a very attractive option for many homeowners . Despite the fall in the feed-in tariff , the price of solar panels has dramatically fallen too , so you can now get a large 4kW solar PV system installed for just -6,000 " back in 2010 the same system may well of cost double that . <p> To be honest , provided you get it installed by a MCS installer and you can claim the FIT payments then the payback is just 8 years and then you will receive a return of -800 ( based on a 3.5kW system ) for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . So from a pure investment point of view " the solar PV is surely a shrewd one . <h> Effect of the Feed-in tariff on value of your home <p> One thing that people do n't tend to take into account is the effect of solar PV on the value of their property . Now the feed-in tariff payments go to the resident of the home ( or the investment company when you consider the solar rent a roof schemes ) . This means that that you will get a physical financial return for 20 years after installing the payments . If you sell your house 2 years after you have paid for the solar PV installation then the new residents will take over this payments " they will have bought a cash generating asset when they bought the house . This should therefore help increase the value of the house , although the extent to which it does depends on when the new residents moved in . Obviously the sooner you sell the property having invested in the solar panels , the more the install is worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the Feed-in tariff therefore has a huge impact on the value of your solar PV system and the value of the house as a whole when you come to sell it on . This does n't even take into account the savings produced on you energy bills since you can use the electricity you produce meaning you do n't need to buy it from the grid at a cost of 15 per kWh . <h> When did you get the solar system installed ? <p> Not only does the distance through the feed-in tariff play a large part on the value that the solar system adds to your home " the year the solar system was installed also impacts this . <p> The reason for this is the feed-in tariff payments have reduced over time , so in October 2011 , the amount paid for each unit of electricity produced from the solar system was 43.3p / kWh . Now ( January 15 ) the rates are just 13.88p / kWh . In addition the payment used to be made for a total term of 25 years . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This means that if the solar system was installed prior to October 2011 , then the value of the system ( and therefore the impact it will have on the value of the house as a whole ) is much higher . <h> Was the system installed with one inverter or micro inverters ? <p> When the solar industry took off ( about the same time the feed in tariff was introduced coincidentally ! ) , most solar PV systems were installed with one string inverter . <p> There are several issues with these string inverters " including efficiency of the system ; basically each panel would operate at the level of the worst operating panel . The issue here though is that the high voltages going through these inverters mean they do n't last too long " in fact they last about 10 years . Therefore they need to be replaced at a cost of about -1,000 . <p> Solar PV systems with Micro inverters installed not only have higher efficiency ( electrical output ) , they also last for much longer because the voltages going through them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to be in excess of 20 years " so obviously this means lower maintenance costs for the incoming occupant , therefore the system is worth more to the incumbent ! <h> The cost of electricity <p> Another- point to consider is the cost of electricity over time . Now this is very difficult for us to predict . At the time of writing the cost of oil is falling almost daily and as a result the cost of energy , and electricity is reducing . This is on the back of consistent 10% annual increases in energy bills we have seen over the last 8 years . <p> Based on historic trends we are pretty confident that the cost of electricity will increase over time , this means that energy savings today cash wise ( produced from using the free solar ) will be smaller than in the future . <p> Obviously this will make solar systems a far more attractive proposition in the future . <h> Insuring your solar system <p> The final point to consider is the costs associated with having solar panels on your roof " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insure your solar system . At a yearly cost of -250 to cover damage , theft and loss of revenue ( from the feed-in tariff ) , that will make a sizeable dent in the revenue that you get from the feed-in tariff obviously not everyone will take up the insurance- ( some people will just bear the risk ) , but it might be worth considering ! <p> So there you have it " the value that solar PV adds to your home varies considerably depending on when the system was installed and also the type of system . If you still have a decent amount of time to run on the feed-in tariff though , as a cash-generating asset , it really should add to the property value . <h> 19 comments <p> The article is truly an interesting one as it sheds a considerable amount of light on an important matter .

Unfortunately some people simply cant see past how they look they can be quite an eyesore according to some home buyers . <p> If it takes a number of years for the cost to be recuperated , maybe its not the best option just before you move . However , if you 've just moved into the property , that may be the best time to invest in solar panels when the time does come to sell , you 'll be ready to reap the rewards . <p> Solar panel is one of the best additions that you can have in your home , specially if you are planning to sell it after dome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus the chance that you can increase the price of your house . <p> Hmmm So home owners are expected to fork out some -6,000 for the panels and installation , and not break even until approx 8 years have elapsed ! !

You can charge up batteries for free , mowers , a car , Dysons and any number of battery powered devices . You can also get a whopper battery to run your entire house from inc all your hot water and you can keep the subsidy when you move house , but the new occupier gets the free electricity . Its actually a no brainer if you have the -6K earning less than1%.in the bank . <p> You have not mentioned the choice of solar PV panels from a rating and efficiency point of view . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted 11 Sunpower panels rated at 327W with Solar Edge Connectors giving me a max rating of 3.6kWp . The Solar Edge Connectors monitor each panel so that if one panel is shaded the others still produce power . My system does not slow down to the speed of the slowest ship as the article suggests for other installations . Sunpower guarantee the panels for 25 years , the inverter is guaranteed for 12 years . Longevity for the Inverters also depends on where they are sited and the ambient temperature in the location . I also have the ability to interrogate my system to monitor performance . A little more expensive but well worth the investment . <p> Hi Martin , We recommend most people install with micro-inverters now these come with 25 year warranties in the most part so will last the lifespan of the system . Microinverters mean that all the panels work independently from one another so shading is n't really a problem anymore . <p> I have to agree with Audrey that yes , a homes value will increase with a solar PV installed . Sellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to fulfill since it is a worthwhile investment anyway . Its always better to spend a little more for solar power than to pay for expensive electric bills . <p> Solar is a fantastic investment , more people are now understanding the concept more we had a 4kw system installed by a local company &amp; it only cost -5100,1st year i recieved total savings of -933 . The company i brought from was Dynamic Solar Installations in Cambridge 01223653165 maybe you should give them a call ( mention me as I will get a -50 finders fee ) <p> The 43.3p per unit has increased with inflation and is worth a fraction under 50p now ( when the back-to-the-grid payment is included ) My system cost -15,500 four years ago but I got over -1,800 in FIT last year . <p> I bought our house with a 3.8KW solar system on the roof . For us it is perfect since the system had been in place only 3 years so we benefit from quarterly fit payments and free electricity . Did n't  know that about the inverter though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system <p> Hi Jez , Sounds like you could have landed on your feet there ! If it was installed 3 years ago this was about the time the Feed-in tariff was 43p per kWh , so not only will you have got this rally good rate , it is also locked in for 25 years ( now the FIT is only paid over 20 years ) . <p> Hi James I think the FIT went down in March 2012 , as we had ours installed a week before it went down and had to wait for a decision on the price we would be paid . We got the 43p rate , but my brother had his fitted three weeks later and only got 19p . <p> Installing solar panels not only helps you fetch a higher asking price , but it can also help your home sell 20% faster as properties without solar installations . As electricity prices go up ( as they most certainly will ) , the advantages of solar energy rise proportionally as well .

If you are trying to hit a certain performance level , or you need your EPC to hit the higher levels , then a full lighting design would certainly be preferable , but I do not believe it would be a legal requirement in your case . Please ensure that you get a proper consultation on the best lighting setup however . You want to ensure the occupants have sufficient lighting levels and are satisfied tenants . 
@@36748895 @5748895/ <h> Maintaining your biomass system <h> Heating <p> If you 're considering installing a biomass boiler , you 'll probably know it will need a bit more looking after than an ordinary gas boiler . A gas boiler needs to be checked by an engineer every year , but with a biomass boiler , you 'll need to give it more regular care . Most of it 's pretty easy , but it is worth considering before you commit whether you are willing to put in the extra time and effort ! <p> The amount of attention it needs depends on the model and the type of fuel you use . Wood logs , chips and pellets all burn in different ways and create different amounts of waste " and some high-end biomass boilers have extra features which mean they can look after themselves to a certain extent . <p> In order to keep your system running efficiently and to ensure a good return on your investment , it is important to provide adequate maintenance . The- following gives you an idea of what you will need to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any components where necessary <p> Annually " This is usually carried out via a service contract with the installer . Multiple checks , as well as cleaning the flue and greasing the bearings . <h> Cleaning your biomass boiler <p> Some biomass boilers will need cleaning more often than others . Ash can collect in the combustion chamber , heat exchanger and flue/chimney , lowering the efficiency of the boiler . Although good quality wood fuel will produce less ash , it will still need clearing out now and then . Most non self-cleaning boilers will need cleaning every week , and they should be completely shut down and cooled beforehand . The manufacturer 's instructions will tell you how often your boiler should be cleaned . Some top models even automatically notify you when they need cleaning . <p> If your biomass boiler is self-cleaning , ash will collect in the ash bin , so you 'll only have to empty that .

There are two monitoring types you can use : <p> Ultrasonic " Cheap and easy to install , these monitors are likely sufficient for smaller plants , but have an accuracy of only +/- 4% .

@@36748897 @5748897/ <h> What is compressed air energy storage ? <p> The purpose of compressed air energy storage is to help manage the supply of electricity in the grid . For example when the wind blows a wind turbine will produce power , but this power may be produced when there is no demand for it . At this time it becomes necessary for us to be able to store the electricity , so we can use it when there is a peak in demand . Compressed air energy storage is the second biggest form of energy storage currently behind- pumped storage . <p> Compressed air energy storage involves converting electrical energy into high-pressure compressed air that can be released at a later time to drive a turbine generator to produce electricity . This means it can work along side technologies such as- wind turbines- to provide and store electricity 24/7 . Ideally the compressed air is stored in an existing geographical formation such as a disused hard-rock or salt mine ( keeps cost down ) , rather than producing specialist surface piping , which can be expensive . <h> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compressed air energy storage facility was the E.ON-Kraftwerk 's <p> 290MW plant built in Huntorf , Germany in 1978 . This plant was built to help manage grid loads , by storing the electricity as pressurised air when demand was low during the night . When there was peak demand , the compressed air was released to create the electricity , in an effort to lower peak electricity costs . <p> This plant , which is still maintained as a power back-up installation today , compresses air during times of low demand and stores it in two underground salt caverns . It takes 8 hours to fill both of the caverns at a rate of 108 kg / sec . When electricity is needed , the compressed air is released and heated by combusting natural gas to get the air to expand . This drives a 320MW turbine producing electricity for 2 hours , before the caverns need to be refilled . <p> Most other compressed air energy storage plants operate along the same principle , although to increase efficiency they are more focussed on retaining the heat associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency of compressed air energy storage <p> One of the major issues with compressed air energy storage is that when you compress air it heats up. - When the electricity is required it needs to be expanded , which requires heat . In addition the cooler the air , the more you can store . Companies are therefore trying to find ways to best store the heat generated during compression , so it can then be used to heat the air for the expansion helping drive more efficiency in the overall process . <p> There are three types of solutions that can deal with heat build up when the air is initially compressed and are discussed below : <p> Adiabatic storage " retains the heat from compression and re-uses this when the air is expanded to produce the power " expected efficiency around 70% ( although theoretically 100% ) <p> Diabetic storage " takes the heat and dissipates it into the atmosphere via heat intercoolers . When the air is released to go through the turbines it needs to be heated " expected efficiency around 70% . <p> Isothermal storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the internal and external temperatures the same , so as the air is compressed heat dissipates into the atmosphere . Once the air is released to drive the turbine and produce the electricity , heat is bought in from the external environment . <p> New technology is being developed by companies to try and increase the heat retained from the compression process . For example , SustainX from the USA have working on a process to remove the heat by injecting water vapour into the compressed air . The water absorbs the heat which then gets stored and reapplied to the air during the expansion process . <h> Keeping the pressure up <p> One of the final issues to overcome for successful CAES revolves around the pressure of the compressed air as it comes out . If the storage facility is full of compressed air , the cavern pressure is higher . Visa versa if cavern is almost empty then the cavern pressure will be low. - Therefore there are two operating modes when storing compressed air in a fixed volume cavern , which are demonstrated in detail below : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is released , which will mean the turbine creates less electricity as time goes on . <p> Control the flow of air out of the cavern , so it releases more of the compressed air at the end to counter the lower pressure . This will ensure constant electricity supply from the turbine / generator . <p> The latter option is normally used , despite throttling loses ' ( the speed at which the air is released from the cavern ) . This is so there is always a constant store of air driving the turbine , so you can accurately reflect the amount of electricity that the compressed air energy storage facility will be producing . <h> The future of compressed air energy storage <p> In the UK , Seamus Garvey , a professor of Dynamics at Nottingham University , is looking at using deep ocean bags known as energy bags ' to fulfil the role of the natural cavities that are used at the moment . The deep water acts as the pressure vessel , and no matter how full the energy bags are , energy should always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garvey says that with this proposed technology the cost per unit of energy stored is in the order of -1--10 / kWh , where as comparators such as pumped storage come in at -50 / kWh and- electrochemical stores- are about -500 / kWh , therefore make this solution very attractive . <p> It is expected that the UK will need to be able to store about 200GWh of electricity by 2020 , to help support the grid that becomes more dependant on intermittent renewable energy sources . Compressed air energy storage could be a valuable tool in allowing us to hit these ambitious targets .

The obvious way to do this is to make sure that your home is as energy efficient as it can be , so that it requires less heat and electricity to function . <p> By using less gas and electricity you are obviously going to lower your energy bills in the short term , but also you can insulate yourself against future energy price increases . <p> Now , while the importance of insulating your floors , walls and roofs has been talked and written about a lot on TheGreenAge , we have neglected doors " but no longer ! <h> Insulating Doors <p> Doors are pretty fundamental features of a home , not only do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intruders " they also need to be inviting enough to make a good first impression . <p> Fairly recently though , the role doors play in the energy efficiency of the thermal envelope of the home has become more highly appreciated .

Therefore it is important to understand how much heat you may be losing through your door . In 2010 , building regulations recognised the importance of doors within the energy efficiency framework and introduced a maximum u-value of 1.8W / m2K on all new door installations ( you can learn more about u-values by clicking- here ) . <p> Historically , older doors tended to be made of wood , which look great , but after years of exposure to the elements , tend to warp and crack and so do n't really fulfil their roles quite as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a u-value of between 2.5 and 3 , which is not very good for energy efficiency . <p> That is why , on new builds it is unusual to find a pure timber door , since it is almost impossible for the manufactures to get these to the required 1.8W / m2K u-value , even though their traditional appearance remains highly desirable . <p> info Doors on new builds have to have a u-value of less than- 1.8W / m2K /info <p> Some newer doors are made from uPVC , but these again suffer from the same flaws as wooden doors in that they are made from just one material " uPVC " so they too suffer after prolonged exposure to the elements . <h> What is a composite door ? <p> Most doors that meet the new building regulations will be composite doors and these are relatively new to the market . To produce composite doors , different materials are used ; each selected to provide a specific benefit . <p> Materials used in composite doors include PVC , wood , steel , aluminium , insulating foam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce a door that is resistant to the elements , very strong and secure and very energy efficient . In addition , the exterior of the composite door normally consists of a wooden frame covered with the GRP , a material that does n't fade or crack over time " so they are specifically designed to look like traditional wooden doors , but are essentially maintenance free . <p> Now the major issue with insulated doors is cost " a regular door might cost you -100 or less ( although as you might expect , the more you pay even for a regular door , the better the materials used and also probably the quality of the build , making it hardier to the elements and also hopefully more secure ) .

So , what are some of the pitfalls and problems that come with an ASHP installation ? <h> Quality of ASHP unit <p> Just like with boilers , there are good quality units and there are bad quality units . ASHPs can be quite expensive , and that can lead the consumer to go for a lower-quality product . Furthermore , because the market is- fairly new and people do n't  necessarily know the best brand names , it is easier to fool the customer into thinking they are getting a good quality system when perhaps they are not . <p> Low-quality ASHP units can come with plenty of problems . They tend to have smaller heat exchangers more liable to freezing in British winters . This can lower the efficiency of the heat pump as it tries to defrost itself . Better quality units designed for the British market have larger heat exchangers which are designed to avoid- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <h> Siting the heat pump <p> The heat pump needs to be sited in the right spot . If sited incorrectly , the efficiency will likely be much lower , as the air that is released from the heat pump is drawn back in the other side . The other thing is noise they are n't that bad , but we have heard stories of neighbours taking issue with them , so do yourself a favour and keep them happy . Make sure the pump is sited away from your neighbours house just in case . <h> Quality of installer <p> Being a relatively new technology , there are plenty of cowboys out there who do n't know what they are doing . Make sure you use only MCS-accredited installers for this kind of work , and do your due diligence to ensure the installer has good feedback from other customers . <h> Inappropriate property for ASHP <p> You can have a perfectly installed heat pump , but if the property is draughty and poorly insulated , the heat pump is never going to get the property up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and radiators sufficiently sized . This is something that an installer should check as part of the initial survey , but make sure that this is checked one way or another ! <p> Its also very easy to get suckered into getting a heat pump when your property is on the gas grid and it would actually be cheaper to run off a gas boiler . Even though heat pumps are one of the most efficient ways to heat with electricity , they are still more expensive than using a gas boiler . This is because the price of gas is around 3-4 times cheaper than electricity , and any efficiency gains from the heat pump will not- be enough to compete with the low cost of gas . We only usually recommend heat pumps for those off the gas grid . <h> Claim your RHI <p> For those who are aware of the Renewable Heat Incentive , this part is obvious . Unfortunately , there are people installing heat pumps that are not aware of the scheme and leave it too late to claim , or have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore ineligible .

It can be difficult to know how to heat it , and the fact it is built from glass means it does n't  retain heat well. - Aside from being expensive for your bills , and potentially attracting damp , it is pretty frustrating not to be able to sit comfortably in a part of your own home . Too cold in the winter , too hot in the summer ; it can be really difficult to reach a balance . <p> Obviously , glass is nothing like as good at insulating as solid walls , so hot air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold air can get in from outside . To be honest , although you can limit it by opting for double-glazed glass , some degree of heat loss will always be inevitable with a conservatory . There are things you can do to offset some of the problems though ; were going to run you through a couple here . <h> Insulate your conservatory ceiling <p> A modern method of increasing the energy efficiency of your conservatory is to attach insulation to the inside of the roof . Clearly , you will lose some of the natural light entering your conservatory , but it will still come through the walls , and you will be able to create a more comfortable environment . Insulating drastically reduces the amount of heat that can pass through a surface , and because heat rises , ceiling insulation is a measure that can make a real difference . As well as keeping your conservatory warmer in the winter months , it will also stop some of the thermal gain from sunlight hitting your roof in the summer , meaning the room will not overheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> First , battens are fixed to the inside of the roof . Quilted foil insulation is then added between battens , and more battens are attached on top of this . Finally , it is all covered with plasterboard and skimmed with plaster , to create a smooth surface for painting. - Ventilation must be added to ensure the insulation does n't  encourage damp , by allowing condensation to collect between surfaces . <p> Its a relatively cheap and quick process , and wont cause much disruption to the household . <p> The insulation works as a barrier to prevent heat rising through the glass ceiling . In fact , the measure can reduce heat loss from the conservatory from 90% to as little as 10%. - It also stops sunlight causing the room to overheat . <p> For help finding a local installer for the measure , fill in the contact form at the bottom of the page . <h> Install infrared heating <p> The main issue with conservatories is that their temperature is badly affected by draughts . Normal convection heating ( i.e. radiators ) heats the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conservatories . Because infrared heats via ( safe ) radiation instead , its easier to reach a certain temperature and maintain it . Infrared heat rays heat the fabric of the building , and its contents , directly . <h> From -419.99 <p> Herschels Aspect heater is a great option . Its a stylish and discreet bar heater that can be placed on the wall and will direct heat down and outwards , heating the floor , the furniture and you ! This thermal mass will then stay warm and continue to radiate heat , even after the heaters are turned off . You will feel radiant heat even if draughts enter the conservatory , because infrared is a completely different , more direct form of heating . You can also get portable infrared heaters for extra boosts of heat when sitting there on a cold day . <p> It goes without saying that your conservatory will never be the warmest room in your home , but if you want to heat it , infrared definitely makes the most sense . <p> Interested in having your conservatory insulated ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are kiloWatt-hours and what is the cost per mile of an electric car ? <h> July 11 , 2017 <p> Prices correct as of July 2017 <p> When you 're thinking about buying an electric car , you 'll hear lots of technical terms bandied around . You may get told , for instance , that a car will cost a certain amount to run per kiloWatt-hour . This might not mean much to you or me ! What does it mean in real terms ? <h> What is a kWh ? <p> A kiloWatt-hour is the most common unit for measuring electricity usage . Watts have- been used for a long time to measure the electricity requirement of lights and appliances , and the kWh ( 1000Watts ) is now used to measure the efficiency of electric car models . Roughly speaking , the cost per kWh in an electric car is the equivalent of what you pay per litre for petrol or diesel at the pumps with a normal car . In- practical terms , the way to explain the cost of kiloWatt-hours used by electric cars goes something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pay for one hour of electricity from the National Grid . The average price per unit ( kWh ) is 12.5p , but it depends on your tariff and provider . <p> The second is the size of your cars battery in kWh . The larger the capacity of your electric cars battery ( in kWh ) , the further it will be able to go before recharging . But it will take longer to charge in the first place ! <h> So how much does it cost to charge an electric car ? <p> To work out- the charging costs of an electric car , simply multiply the cost of electricity per unit- ( kWh ) by the battery capacity of the model in kW . <p> Let 's take the example of a standard single-rate electricity tariff and a mid-range electric car ( Renault Zoe ) : <p> 12p x 41kWh = 492 <p> This means a total home charging cost ( to full battery capacity ) of -4.92 . <h> How does this cost per kWh compare to cost per litre for a normal petrol car ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of petrol per litre- and multiply it by the size of the fuel tank in this case , we have taken the example of a 45l Renault Clio . <p> -1.19 x 45l = -53.55 <p> So a full tank of petrol will cost you -50 , but a full charge of an electric battery will cost a fiver . <p> Its worth saying at this point that you cant really compare like-for-like , as the range ( i.e. how far a car will get before requiring re-fuelling/recharging ) is different for petrol and electric cars . The majority of petrol cars have a range of around 2-3 times that of an electric car . Costs per mile are difficult to estimate because of the wide number of variables that affect them . Clearly , how long exactly this 41kWh lasts/how far it gets you depends on your driving speed and the load of the car , among other things . So the real-life range will be different from the one specified by the manufacturer . This aside , - there is still a big difference in the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out far cheaper per mile . <h> Cost per mile of electric cars <p> To work out the cost per mile to run an electric car , you divide the cost of charging per mile by the range of the car . If we round up the -4.92 charging cost for the Renault Zoe above , and use the manufacturers specified range ( 250 miles ) , we get : <p> 5/250 = 0.2p per mile . <p> Compare this to the cost per mile of the petrol car above ( more than -1 ) and you can see why electric cars are known for their efficiency ! <p> As mentioned above , real costs would probably be slightly higher , because this range assumes full efficiency , but hopefully we 've explained why electric cars are a cheap option , at least in terms of running costs . These could be reduced even further if the battery was charged at- off-peak times with an Economy 7 or time of use tariff. - The cheapest way to charge an electric car is at home , and the easiest way of doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Installing an electric car- charging point <p> Interested in having shortly ! <p> Interested in having a home EV charging point installed ? 184572 @qwx384572 184569 @qwx384569 184566 @qwx384566 <h> Can I get an air source heat pump if I live on the coast ? <h> July 6 , 2017 <p> A few people have asked us- whether it is possible to have an air source heat pump if they live- near the coast .

Any property within 4 miles of the coast should be aware of this issue and your installer should be informing you and letting you know your options . <h> Avoiding corrosion with coastal heat pumps <p> Whilst corrosion can be a real issue for coastal heat pumps , there is a solution . There are protective coatings that can be applied to the heat pump to avoid corrosion . These are applied at the time of installation and may need touching up over the life of the unit .

This is true for any heat pump , whether on the coast or inland , but we feel it is important to emphasise . Heat pumps need to be away from walls and fences , and need to allow good air flow around them . If this is not the case , air can leave the unit and go back into the intake .

Between 2019 and 2021 , it will launch 5 fully electric cars , 3 of which will be Volvo models and the other 2 will come via their high-performance car arm , Polestar . This announcement represents perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional car makers , in the move towards electrification . However , we must n't forget Tesla , the company that can really take the credit for propelling electric vehicles into the mainstream over the last 5 or years or so . <h> Why are Volvo going electric ? <p> We have seen demand for electric cars in recent years , and getting into the game early is no bad thing . The benefits of electric cars are becoming more widely known , and the market will only increase. - A quarter of UK carbon emissions- are from road transport , petrol and diesel cars are increasingly unpopular since the VW emissions scandal . Manufacturers and potential buyers are currently supported by generous government grants to help EU countries reach ambitious carbon reduction targets for tackling climate change and urban air pollution . <p> This announcement also comes on the back of battery prices dropping dramatically ( as a result of mass production ) and it seems the fabled $100/kWh price is only months away ! <p> Where once electric cars were a gimmick , they are now an attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mean for the petrol car market ? <p> Volvo estimate that by 2025 they will have sold 1m electrified cars ( either hybrid or full electric ) . This is exciting news for consumers , who will have much more to choose from where electric cars are concerned and also for the those worried about the environmental impacts of petrol cars ! We predict that well be seeing more and more electric cars on the roads in the coming years , with people increasingly switching on to their benefits . <h> Installing an EV charging point <p> Interested in having shortly ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 184572 @qwx384572 184569 @qwx384569 184566 @qwx384566 <h> What is an air to air heat pump ? <h> July 4 , 2017 <p> Heat pumps are an often misunderstood way to condition your home , so in this blog we are going to demystify the air source heat pump and find out if they could be a good option for your home . <h> How do air to air heat pumps work ? <p> Air source heat pumps have been around for a long time . More people know them by their common name : the air conditioning unit . In the UK , they are more often found in offices than in the home , but they are becoming more popular for domestic properties , particularly in new builds . The difference with modern heat pumps is that they can actually heat a property , as well as cool- it . <p> The unit works by taking in heat from the outside air . This heat is amplified using a compressor and then released into the home . With an air to water heat pump , the heat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through radiators or underfloor heating . With- air to air heat pumps , warm air is emitted directly from the unit . <p> Of course , with an air to air heat pump , you will need to have ducting around the house to allow the air to circulate . With an air to water system , a conventional radiator or underfloor system will be required . <h> Are air to air heat pumps good for domestic properties ? <p> Air to air heat pumps are a very efficient way to heat a property . That is why many larger commercial buildings will use a heat pump with integrated ducting to condition a property . They also have the added advantage of being able to cool during the summer and heat during the winter , where central heating systems do not . <p> Air to air is often not practical for domestic properties because of the additional ducting required , but for a large scale retrofit or new build , it could be a viable option . Using warm air to heat a home is actually really efficient and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must remember that whilst air to air heat pumps are pretty efficient , they are usually more expensive to run than a gas central heating system because of the relative price of gas to electricity . We usually recommend sticking with gas central heating if that is available where you live , if cost is the major consideration . <p> One more thing to remember is that an air to air heat pump will not heat your hot water , whereas an air to water pump can be used to help heat your hot water too . This can save money because immersion heating of hot water is very expensive . <h> How much do air to air heat pumps cost ? <p> Because central heating is not required , air to air heat pumps will actually cost less to install than an air to water equivalent . The more difficult part of the installation is working out how to include the ducting , as this is not normally considered in a home heating installation . Depending on the size of the property , you will likely be looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of the ducting . <h> Are there any grants for heat pumps ? <p> The governments Renewable Heat Incentive is available for air to water and ground source heat pumps , but not available for air to air pumps . The RHI pays out a few thousand pounds over 7 years following the installation of an air to water heat pump , so it may be worth going for this option once you have crunched the numbers . <p> There are currently no government grants available for air to air pumps . <h> Air to air vs. air to water heat pumps <p> As we have touched on , there are a couple of factors you need to consider when deciding between the two , so we have made a list of pros and cons for you to help decide : <h> Air to air <p> Cheaper to install than air to water , dependent on the cost of ducting . <p> Provides excellent conditioning of rooms and heats quicker than radiators <p> Can also be sued to cool property as well as heat . <h> Air to water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook up to existing radiators or underfloor in most cases <p> Can heat your hot water as well as central heating <p> So we hope this has helped you work out what is right for your property .

A qualified assessor visits your property and- looks at every- aspect of the building and the systems within it and gives it a rating from A-G , with A being the most efficient property possible . The survey can be done in as little as an hour , and afterwards you can- be sent a personalised recommendations report , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the property . This considers things- like the heating system and how much insulation the property has , and how installing or updating them could improve your rating . <p> EPCs can be split into two categories domestic and commercial and its a legal requirement to have an EPC of a certain rating if you are renting out a property ; but more and more people are choosing to get an EPC on their own home . Let us explain why ! <h> Commercial EPC <p> Getting an- EPC every ten years has been a legal requirement for every rented property since 2007 , but stricter guidelines have recently been brought in. - The new Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards ( MEES ) require your property to have a rating of E or above on your EPC . If not , the- landlord will not be allowed to let the property , and will be liable to pay a fine of up to -150,000 . Ensuring properties are not hugely inefficient has two benefits : ensuring some level of protection for tenants against high energy bills , and reducing carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to take EPC ratings into consideration . A more energy efficient property means cheaper bills for those living in the property , - and happy tenants are more likely to pay their rent on time ! It also means- less work for property developers if you ever come to sell . Therefore , if you 're looking to sell or rent out your property , its worthwhile making sure it has the- best chance of a good rating . All potential tenants and buyers- are legally entitled to see this information before making any decisions . <h> Domestic EPC <p> Although not required by law , getting a domestic EPC is a great way to get to grips with how you could make your home more efficient . Knowing the best ways to improve your homes energy efficiency can be a bit alienating for the ordinary homeowner , so its useful to have a guide of what to think about. - If you make the changes suggested ( some of which , like insulation , are fairly cheap ) , you could find it cuts your bills significantly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic EPC normally only costs around -50 and the benefits are clear cheaper energy bills , a warmer home and the knowledge that you are reducing your carbon footprint ! <h> Getting an EPC <p> Need an EPC ?

The national rollout scheme originally intended to be completed in 2020 is now encountering more problems , with fears that rising costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rollout delayed <p> The rate of installations needs to increase , as its been much slower than first hoped. - Up to 7 million smart meters have been installed to date in the UK , of the 53 million originally intended by 2020. - The cost to suppliers of rolling out the scheme is rising , as many customers have been harder to persuade than expected . <p> Due to a lack of clear advice , a lot of people fail to see the benefits of having a smart meter installed especially as it basically means taking a day off work . Scaremongering has n't  helped , with theories circulating about ulterior motives for collecting customers usage information ! - Momentum has also been halted by serious technical issues , as some peoples meters have stopped working after switching supplier , despite repeated assurances otherwise . <h> Rising costs of smart meters <p> There has been a lot of criticism that the scheme has been badly run and suggestions it should be be paused and reconsidered , before costs spiral further . The cost per household of having a smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative costs from chasing hard-to-reach customers . Although householders wo n't shoulder the whole cost of installation , a fraction will be passed on to them via their energy bills exactly how much- remains to be seen . <p> The increased cost per household has been blamed in part for the big six energy companies recently rising bills . If bill payers end up shouldering higher costs for installation , it will contradict promises made by the government , further fueling- mistrust . <h> What 's next for smart meters ? <p> The government included its commitment to smart meters in the Queens Speech to Parliament . There was a veiled admission of defeat in the subtle change of wording used ; there 's now only a promise to offer a smart meter to every household by 2020 . This buys them more time to ( hopefully ) iron out all the problems Something that might worry some people is the fact that the Queens Speech also mentioned the possibility of smart meter regulations being changed in the future . <p> Many already have fears over how data will be stored and used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  collect any more data than ordinary meters , and energy companies cant share it unless you give them explicit permission . <p> Importantly , no-one will be forced to have a smart meter installed but there is still a lot of hope for their benefits , provided current issues are resolved . Proponents say that the positives of smart meters will mean they pay for themselves in the future , but in order for the benefits to be realised , the majority of UK residents need to be persuaded to co-operate . The government and energy companies have a lot to do to reassure people and encourage them that getting a smart meter is in their best interests . <p> Have you had a smart meter installed ? Do you think they are a good thing , or an expensive mistake for the UK ? - <h> What to think about when installing solar panels <p> Solar panels are a popular choice for those wanting to generate their own electricity . They 're relatively quick to install , easy to maintain , and can save you money while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider when thinking about installing them , though " we are going to run you through some of these . <p> The three main things to think about : <p> The roof you install the solar PV system on should ideally face between south-east and south-west . <p> The inverter ( which changes the direct current generated into alternating current to be used by domestic appliances ) should be placed close to the PV panels , to minimise transmission losses . <p> The roof should not be prone to overshading from trees or other buildings . <h> Placement/angle <p> Be careful about the placement of your panels . Although solar PV panels are at their most efficient when facing south , they will still generate some electricity in other generations but not as much . It 's worth taking this into account when thinking about whether or not your home is suitable . North-facing orientations should be avoided . <p> The angle of the panels is also really important . A mid-point between horizontal and vertical " such as a typical UK house roof at around 32- will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , so the minimum tilt you need to allow rain to wash away dust is 15- off horizontal . If your array will be facing east or west , a shallower tilt angle will work better , as the sun is lower in the sky as it moves away from due south . If you have a flat roof , you can mount panels on frames and angle them where they will get the best yield possible . <p> You can get an automatic- solar tracker , which moves your panels to make sure they are always facing the sun . However , these are more expensive and do n't  perform as well as their stationary counterparts in harsh weather conditions . <h> Shadowing <p> Shadows have a big impact on the performance of solar panels . If your panels are even slightly shaded by large trees or nearby buildings , they will not work as effectively . This is because solar panels are connected into strings and even- if only one cell in a string is blocked , the output of the other panels in the string drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheat this to a certain extent by arranging modules so that shadows will affect one whole string if possible , rather than the end cell of multiple strings . <h> Inverter <p> Solar panels produce electricity in direct current ( DC ) , which needs to be converted into alternating current ( AC ) before it can be used in the home . Systems include an inverter for this reason , and to work at maximum efficiency , it should be installed as close to the panels as possible . Most choose to place it in the loft.The placement of your diverter is also important if you are hoping to claim Feed in Tariff payments . <p> It 's well worth doing your research to find a good solar PV installer , as they 'll know- all the above and will be able to ensure that it is taken into account . <h> Optional extras for maximum efficiency <h> Solar PV diverter <p> Installing a solar PV diverter will make sure you maximise savings on your bills , by allowing you to use as much of your self-generated electricity as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels that is not used straight away is sent to the National Grid , and you 'll have to pay to import electricity like anyone else- at times when the sun is n't shining . If you install a diverter , it sends surplus electricity you do n't  use to your immersion heater , meaning you 'll save money on water heating . <h> Solar PV battery storage <p> You could even go one further and install a solar battery storage system although itll cost you . This allows you to store the electricity you generate , to be used whenever you want it , leaving you less reliant on national energy stores , and cutting your bills even further- as a result . <h> Installing solar PV <p> Are you thinking about installing shortly ! <p> Interested in getting a solar PV system installed ? 184572 @qwx384572 
@@36748900 @5748900/ <h> Why render a house ? <h> April 20 , 2015 <h> Why should you render a property ? <p> When you walk down a typical street in town , you will see a mixture of properties . Some are more modern , some are older , some will have exposed brick , some will have a coloured render applied . You might ask why some properties have a render finish and others do n't " good question ! Let 's try and take you through the various reasons for rendering your property <h> Reason 1 " Aesthetics <p> The number one reason historically for rendering a property is to improve the look . Adding a render coat can really brighten up a shabby looking wall , and it gives the opportunity to give the whole house a facelift . <p> Some properties can have a real mish-mash of brick types , unattractive wear from years of exposure , or just look tired and unattractive . Adding a layer of render gives you the opportunity to completely change the look of the property " giving you a smooth uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean pebbledash , but nowadays the standard is usually a white smooth render . <p> If your render is old and tired , or perhaps cracked , it might be necessary to re-render also . This will involve stripping off the old render and starting afresh on the exposed wall . You may also have painted brickwork , which tends to get scruffy looking very quickly ; in which case installing render would be a good alternative to having to re-paint every few years . <p> Obviously beauty is very much in the eye of the beholder though we do still love the brick look ! <h> Reason 2 " Penetrating Damp <p> Another reason people choose to render their homes- is to deal with water ingress and penetrating damp issues . Some forms of brick , especially in exposed areas , can be liable to damp if exposed to the elements over a prolonged period of time . Water gets through the solid brick wall and in to the house , causing a host of problems in the home . Adding a layer of render to the outside wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property and prevents this form of damp from occurring . Of course , this is only really the case on older solid brick properties . If you have a cavity wall , you should n't be getting penetrating damp like this . <p> Remember " if you have damp issues before rendering your property , get an expert to take a look and let you know the best course of action . In some situations , render will not be the answer , and where rendering is appropriate , the type of render used will be important " so do your research if you are trying to deal with damp . <h> Reason 3 " Improve thermal performance <p> Rendering your property will provide a slight insulating effect of its own , but if you are rendering , it is a great time to consider full external insulation . <p> External solid wall insulation is an expensive job " but so is rendering , and if you are putting scaffolding up and getting a contractor to render , this is the best and cheapest time to look as external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -50-60 per square meter , whilst external insulation with render is around -100 per square meter , so insulating at the same time is going to be great value . You can also benefit from various grant monies that are available for insulation , but not for rendering . <p> We have found that some of our customers actually end up spending less on external insulation with a render finish than they would on rendering alone " and they then get to see masses of savings on their energy bills in to the bargain . <h> Choosing the right render <p> Getting the right type of render is really important , as each type has different properties that could benefit your property or exacerbate problems . <p> We typically use one of three types of render : <p> Acrylic " This is the cheapest type of render and can provide really vibrant colours . The drawback is that it is not breathable " and this can be an issue for some properties . <p> Mineral " This type of render is very tough wearing , and is somewhat breathable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for most instances . <p> Silicone Silicate " This type of render is the most expensive , but is lots of beneficial properties " it is self cleaning and breathable . One downside is that it can only really be installed in the summer months as it needs milder temperatures to be able to dry . <h> Is rendering worth it ? <p> There are several really good reasons for looking to render your property , even if you live in a more modern house . Having said this , you are looking at a considerable cost " rendering is not going to be worth it for everyone . Think carefully about the type of render you want to go for and whether you want to insulate at the same time " because this is an investment that is going to be on your wall for- many , many years and it is going to be costly to remove or replace . 184574 @qwx384574 184572 @qwx384572 <h> 2 comments <p> Hi Meredith , the installation company should remove the wiring away from the walls , install the rendering solution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the external trunking and they can be tucked away on corners or away from the high visibility areas to make the visuals look good . Depends on the installer , but jobs we have seen with trunking of wires on the surface look pretty good . 
@@36748901 @5748901/ <h> Should I get a stove fan ? <h> November 21 , 2014 <p> Its now winter ; all of the lights are already on at 4:30 and we have started to rely on the central heating . One- comfort I have is that once I get home , I can put my feet up and feel the warmth from my wood-burning stove . It is really cheap to run and saves me plenty of money compared to turning the central heating on . <h> Pre-stove fan problems <p> The problem is that if I do n't position myself fairly close to the stove and singe my eyebrows , I do n't really feel the warmth . This is because most of the heat generated heads straight up to the ceiling and then the floor above due to convection . Although this is lovely when I get to bed , it is far from ideal . So this led me to try a stove fan . <h> What are stove fans- designed to do ? <p> Designed to rapidly improve the circulation of heat from the stove , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stove fans aim to not only improve comfort but also improve the stove 's efficiency and reach . <h> So how did it work for me ? <p> The main concerns I had before I tried it were noise of the rotation , aesthetics and actual effectiveness .

No longer did I have to sit close to the stove to feel the heat ! Result ! <h> FROM JUST -61.95 <p> While the main benefits are clearly aimed at comfort rather than payback and money saving , the stove fan does reduce the heat demand of the stove . This means that it requires less fuel to heat the room , and consequently lowers my bills . Another key point to make is that as the stove fan uses heat from the stove itself to spin , it does n't  need batteries or any other power source to run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaches a temperature of just over 450c . <h> How do they work ? <p> The heat from the stove drives their motion , which allows for a seamless and quiet operation . The start up temperature varies depending on the make and model , but I 've found that it 's pretty quick from the initial flame . Be careful to have a look at the maximum temperature as some models have to be taken off the stove after a while ( using heavy duty heat proof gloves of course ) the maximum for the Phoenix- stove fan is 3400c , so no such problems here ! <p> Instead of the heat rising vertically with a standard stove , the stove fan uses its blades to divert the warm air horizontally . This means it will heat the part of the room you are sitting in , rather than just the ceiling . The extra movement of air will help warm the whole of the room , not just the area near the stove . <p> Below is a video of a- test fan <p> The fan starts very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature of the stove at the time ! If the fan is just sitting on the fire as it is lit , it will take time to warm up sufficiently to start spinning . <h> Should you get a stove fan ? <p> If you want to increase the efficiency of your stove , have a more comfortable heat throughout the room and remove hot and cold spots then I can honestly say that a stove fan is absolutely the energy efficient gadget for you . <p> Hi all , I have a high top hood on my stove ( witches hat ) with top flue , no room behind for rear flue , so no room/enough flat surface to fit a stove fan , can I attach a 2mm thick aluminium shelf to the side of the hood making sure as much metal as possible is touching the hood and sit the fan on that ? Will the ally melt , will it work ? Regards , Steve <p> Hi Steve , it depends entirely on how hot this new metal shelf will get to be honest . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees before they start rotating . There are some that operate at slightly lower temps , but not many !

It is an inglenook fireplacecould I put a metal shelf into the wall to place the fan on ? . have you any other ideas please ? Many thanks <p> The Valiant Premium 4 pushes more air than the 2 blade fans on the market , the Ventum 3 pushes virtually the same as the Premium 4 . The Valiant Ventum II is a punchy little fan pushing the same air as the " standard " 2 blade fans , but blows harder , form a smaller diameter fan great on narrow-boats , or where heat is required to be pushed further . Valiant Premium and Ventums have the 2 year guarantee too . <p> Our high ceiling lounge was freezing in the summer do dire in the winter .

Tia <p> Hi Maureen , it depends how hot the alcove gets . In truth I doubt it will work , since I would n't of thought it will be hot enough but that is the only way to tell . I think the stove fans start operating at temperatures of over 65 degrees centigrade ( check with the supplier to make sure though as this varies between units ! ) <p> I bought a stove fan last autumn to help move the heat more effectively around my living room . The really do seem to do the trick although you need to have space to install on ( which would be impossible if the stove was built into the chimney space ) . I think you can get the low temperatures ones now for the standstone heaters too . <p> I bought one of these to use on my Soapstone stove but it never gets hot enough to get the stove fan spinning . So annoyed cause they seem like such a great idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 65 degrees ? <p> Great addition to the stove . Really does start to belt out the heat over a bigger area . Would recommend to anyone , and have even purchased one for my sister . What is their lifespan just for future reference ? <p> We bought one of these stove fans a while back and it made such a difference to our fire place and the heat output . They fan takes longer to spin than the video shows mind . The fan must of already been quite warm ! I think ours takes about a minute to start spinning . <p> We installed one of these stove fans and they are absolutely fantastic . It had to be a mini so it fitted on top of the fire , but it still kicks out loads of heat . And I love they ways they use the heat to spin , no electricity required , very simple idea but hugely affective. 
@@36748902 @5748902/ <h> Should I get a wood burning stove ? <h> February 19 , 2014 <p> Wood burning stoves have become incredibly popular over the last few years , and it 's easy to see why . With spiralling energy costs , people are really keen to find ways to save money and not only do wood burners save money , they also make a great looking feature in a room and as a result have become very desirable for many households in the UK . <p> Whilst stoves can be used as an alternative for the main heating system in a home , they really are an excellent supplementary system . In cold periods when the central heating is n't enough , or you do n't want to turn it on full blast , the stove can be used as a supplement , and this proves particularly cost-effective compared to the cost of electric room heaters . <h> How much do wood burning stoves cost ? <p> A typical stove will set you back around -700--1,500 , depending on the model . If you include installation costs " preparing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double . So they are n't necessarily a cheap piece of kit . Even so , you could potentially see a return on investment in just 5 years . <h> Why install a wood burning stove <p> People in the UK tend to spend most of their time in one room " the living room , and as such a lot of the heating costs are focussed here . Therefore , if you can use a cheaper form of heating in just this location , then the costs of the central heating and additional heating should fall considerably . <p> How much cheaper is it ? Well the cost of wood logs is obviously variable , depending on your source and where you live . Some people have access to free wood from gardens and the local area , which is fantastic " this essentially means once you have installed the wood burner , you can heat your home for free . <p> The majority of people will not be so fortunate though , having to source seasoned logs from suppliers and typically the cost of this works out about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating systems ) . <p> If you are using electricity to heat your home , getting a wood burner is a lot cheaper " so it really is a no brainer if you have somewhere to put it ! Remember electricity costs 15p / kWh , so installing a word burner , with fuel costs of just 4p / kWh is about 3-4 times cheaper . <p> The other thing to consider is that a wood burner is a carbon neutral way to heat the home . While the tree grows it absorbs the carbon dioxide , which it then uses for growth . When the tree is burnt , it releases this carbon dioxide " so the whole process means there is no net increase in the amount of CO2 being released into the atmosphere , thus wood burning stoves are considered to be environmentally friendly . <h> Does a stove fan increase the efficiency of a wood burning stove ? <p> Yes , stove fans are a great way to get the most out of your stove . They sit on top of the stove and move the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the ceiling . <p> Stove fans do not require any power to run , as they utilise the temperature of the stove to power a motor which in turn circulates the air. - We sell a range of SmartFan stove fans , which you can look at by clicking on the link below . Or have a look at the Valiant Stove Fan HERE . <h> FROM -61.95 <p> We also offer mini stove fans which are shorter to fit in more confined spaces where space is an issue call us on 0208 144 0897 if you would like to discuss . <h> Seasoned or unseasoned wood ? <p> Wood used in a wood burning stove needs to be seasoned , which effectively means it needs to be dried . Freshly chopped wood has a moisture content of between 30 60% , while properly seasoned wood has a moisture content of less than 20% . <p> Burning unseasoned wood means that much of the energy released is devoted to evaporating this moisture . In dry , seasoned wood this is not the case , and as a rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a 1% increase in useful heat obtained from the wood . In addition , since so much energy is required to evaporate the moisture when unseasoned wood is burnt , true combustion is inhibited , meaning the resulting combustion gases contain more particles which can settle on the flue or chimney stack potentially leading to chimney fires . <p> Leaving wood to dry , or buying wood that is already seasoned is a must . <p> You can buy unseasoned wood a lot cheaper than seasoned , so if you have the ability to season yourself , it could make for a really cheap way to heat your room . For this though you will need a decent sized store or woodshed " something you could put in your garden . <h> Can I use a wood burner in a Smoke Free zone like London ? <p> The Clean Air Act limits what can be burnt in some areas of the country . This does not mean you do n't have options though . There is a DEFRA approved list of stoves that qualify as cleanburn ' stoves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Free zone . Unfortunately the cost of these burners is much higher , and they typically retail around -2,000 . Some stoves can also be modified to meet the DEFRA guidelines , but we recommend speaking to the manufacturer to make sure this is the case before investing . <p> The alternative is to use alternative smokeless fuels rather than logs . This will obviously be more expensive , but still cheaper than using electric heating , so could be a viable option for some homes . <h> Is there any funding ? <p> Unfortunately there is no funding available for wood burning stoves ( biomass boilers on the other hand are part of the Renewable Heat Incentive , and offer a very attractive return on investment ) . <h> Biomass Boilers or Wood Burning Stoves ? <p> Firstly , let me point out the difference between the two . Wood burning stoves simply burn wood and heat the room as a result . They generally only heat one room . Biomass boilers burn the wood ( or other forms of biomass ) and use this to heat water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used for hot water . <p> Biomass boilers are much more expensive , but are eligible for the RHI payments from the government and are a great option for some properties looking for a new heating system . <p> The are carbon neutral in that they take in CO2 as part of photosynthesis to grow . The Carbon is therefore stored in the plant / tree . When this is then subsequently burnt it releases this CO2 back into the environment . They are considered carbon neutral as there is no net change in carbon coupled with the fact this can all be done ( growth / cut / burnt ) within a relatively small timescale . Compare that to coal , which takes millions of years hence burning that is releasing previously trapped carbon into the atmosphere . <p> We have two wood burning stoves in our house , one in the living room and one in the dining room they really do pump out an incredible amount of heat . I do agree though , they do n't  make for a good whole house heating replacement 
@@36748903 @5748903/ <h> Carbon capture <p> Carbon capture and storage ( also known as carbon sequestration ) is a method of mitigating the CO2- emitted from the combustion of fossil fuels . It is a way of storing the gas before it is allowed to enter the atmosphere and more recently it also refers to scrubbing CO2- from ambient air , for example using- carbon scrubbers- or converting it into a useful product via- artificial photosynthesis . <h> Carbon storage <p> Various methods have been suggested for storing CO2 , which include storing it in existing geographical formations , deep in the oceans or in the form of mineral carbonates . These will be discussed in more detail below . <p> Geological storage <p> This method involves injecting CO2- into underground geological formations including old oil fields , gas fields , saline formations and old coal mines . By injecting CO2- into declining oil fields , this can force more oil out of the well and the cost of storing the gas can be partially offset by the sale of the extra oil recovered .

However like pushing out and using the extra oil , burning the methane will produce more CO2 . It also is important that the coal field is not over permeable otherwise the gas could leak . However good locations are available in all the geographical locations where the gas could be stored for millions of years . <p> Oceanic storage <p> There are two major methods of ocean storage ; the first is pumping the gas down to depths of 1-3km and letting the gas rise , where it will dissolve into the seawater , this will slowly come out of the water back into the atmosphere . The other method is pumping it down further than 3km , and at this depth the pressure will cause the CO2- to liquefy , and as this liquid is denser than the sea water it will fall to the bottom of the sea and form non reactive pools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect of additional quantities of the gas may well upset ecosystems , so more research needs to be completed in this field . <p> Mineral storage <p> This method involved reacting the CO2- with metal oxides , forming metal carbonates . This reaction requires heat , however the metal oxides needed for the reaction are plentiful ( such as Magnesium ) and the produced carbonates are very stable so they will hold on to the gas for millennia . The major drawback is the heat required for the reaction , so research is ongoing to make this a more economically viable option .

@@36748906 @5748906/ <h> Should I get Micro Inverters for my solar PV system ? <h> August 15 , 2014 <h> What are Solar PV Inverters ? <p> Solar PV panels produce electricity from sunlight , and with over 500,000 systems now installed on people 's roofs in the UK , they have never been more popular . <p> The average solar PV system in the UK is 3.5kW , which with an average panel being 250w mean it will consist of 14 panels ( find more solar PV tips here ) . <p> The electricity produced by solar PV panels is in the form direct current ( DC ) . In the UK , the electricity that we use on the whole is in the form of alternating current- ( AC ) , and so before we can use the electricity produced from the solar PV panels , we need to convert it into AC an inverter carries out this conversion . <h> String Inverters <p> Traditionally , individual solar PV panels are installed in series that lead to one string inverter . These string inverters effectively treat all the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big issue with these string inverters . If there is a problem with one of the panels ( for example a tree causing shading ) , all the other panels will also suffer an equivalent output loss . The panels will operate at the output of the worst performing solar panel . <p> You may think this might put solar PV installers from using them , however they are still by far the most popular setup mainly because they are cheaper to install and also they are easier to replace , since you just replace the one unit . <h> Micro Inverters <p> Micro inverters are attached to each individual panel , which allows the panels to operate independently from one another . <p> This gives them a huge advantage where different solar PV panels in your solar PV array may produce different outputs for whatever reason , since this will not impact all the rest of the panels . <p> A Solar micro inverter <p> For example , imagine a chimney breast situated on a roof of a mid-terrace house , this may cast a shadow for a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string inverter , this would massively reduce daily output from the solar system . With micro inverters , the shadow would obviously impact the output of one panel , but this would not impact the other panels . <p> For this reason , it is estimated that for micro inverters can increase output from solar systems by up to 20% . Since you get paid for each kWh of electricity produced , any way you can maximise output should be encouraged ! <h> Other differences between Micro inverters and string inverters <h> Inverter Lifespan <p> Most string inverters will only come with a 5 year warranty and even the most optimistic solar installers will admit that string inverters will need to be replaced at least once over the life-time of the solar panels . <p> In contrast micro inverters will last far longer ; some manufacturers offer a 25 year warranty for their products . The reason for this is that string inverters need to deal with kilowatts of power and high input DC voltages , so they need high power transistors and electrolytic capacitors " these components unfortunately just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with 250w of power ( the size of a panel ) and the DC voltage is far lower so only require thin film capacitors " eliminating the need for large transformers and electrolytic capacitors . <h> Complexity of install <p> With Micro inverters , you need to install one unit for each individual solar panel " this is obviously more time consuming to do . <p> The benefit is that micro inverters tend to be easier to fix , typically because there is a single point of failure in the inverter , but the larger inverters can be far harder to fix because they are more complicated bits of kit . <h> Cost <p> For a 3.5kW solar PV system , 14 micro inverters would be required ( 1 for each panel ) . With each unit cost approximately -200 , you are looking at a cost of approximately -2,800 . <h> We sell portable solar panels for 12 Volt appliances . <p> A string inverter for a 3.5kW system should only cost -1,500 , which is far cheaper ; this will mean that the initial install cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper . <p> Remember though that these string inverters wo n't last nearly as long " maybe 10 years tops , while a micro inverter might last as long as 20 " 25 years . <h> Safety <p> When the sun is shining , solar panel systems produce a lot of electricity " this means high voltages , especially when you are dealing with string inverters . These can cause arc faults in some cases where cabling running from panels are unplugged or vermin chews through cables . Arc faults are dangerous because they do n't normally trip the circuit breaker " which means that heat can build up potentially causing fire . <p> Micro inverters , running at lower voltages do n't suffer from these problems , although it is worth mentioning that for both types of inverter " a problem like this would be extremely unusual . It is just highlighting the point of operating a system with high voltages ! <h> So are micro inverters worth it ? <p> Is it worth the extra upfront expense of installing micro inverters ? It really depends on whether your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the case , then we would definitely recommend micro inverters . The fact is your system will produce more electricity with these installed , which not only produces higher financial returns via the feed-in tariff but also gives you more free electricity to use in the home . <p> Since the micro inverters last longer and most manufacturers offer far longer warranties , we would where possible advise people to consider getting these installed ! <h> 4 comments <p> If we say that the Warranty period is equivalent to the MTBF ( mean time before failure ) I know that this is questionable , but there should be some such relationship then the proper way to look at it would be ask how long before any one of the 14 micro-inverters fails as compared with how long before the single " string-inverter " fails . <p> Working in years , the way to do this is to take the inverse of the 14 additions of the inverse of the single micro-inverter Warranty period ( 25 years ) . The result of this is an expected failure roughly once every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of erecting scaffold to access the roof-mounted micro-inverter ( plus a micro-inverter replacement ) once every year and three-quarters as opposed to the cost of a " string-inverter " ( in the loft ) once every 5 years . <p> So , it rather looks as if the " string inverter " wins by a considerable margin . <p> However , you could say that this additional cost is offset by the additional system performance claimed to be achieved by the " micro-I " ; but this is only reliably calculable for cases of known shading which , for most roof-mounted systems , is totally absent . <p> You could say that the ability to know which PV panel has failed ( they too will have an MTBF ) is a benefit too ; it will save some technician time in executing diagnostics up on the roof . If you apply the same principle wrt Warranty period equals the MTBF then , for 25 years per panel in a 14 panel system , you get the same ( rather shocking ) expectation that a panel will fail about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 13 panels consisting of two separate sub-systems ( one pointing SE and one pointing SW ) , each with its own " string-I " . It is now about 4.75 years old and thus far has suffered zero failures . This either means that I am very lucky or that the proposition that the Warranty period is the same as the MTBF is false . If I was a manufacturer I think that I would set the Warranty period well inside the calculated MTBF let 's hope so . <p> Manufacturers are extremely secretive about MTBF ( they always know what it is but NEVER NEVER release it to the public for fear of giving the public a concrete method of comparing products ) ; this applies to all physical things inverters , cell-phones , fridges , air to air heat pumps , cars , houses , bridges , aircraft , everything ! Just think , you might actually be in a position to choose the more reliable aircraft for your flight to Miami if they released this known information .

Due to the lack of permeability of the shale rock , the gas is trapped and can not be extracted through a conventional well bore . Instead , the gas is extracted by pumping water , sand and other chemicals under high pressure into the shale layer , causing fractures in the rock allowing gas to escape . <p> It is a growing market with many countries in the world keen on exploiting their reserves of gas . Oil and gas from the middle east and Russia have dominated the market for some time , but the possibility of this gas being extracted in other countries has the potential to shake up the world energy market . <h> American shale gas <p> Currently , the American shale gas industry employs 600,000 people , and is worth around $10 billion . Shale gas accounts for around 20% of gas production in the US . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fracking financially viable and has 1 million fracks ' completed . Recently it was announced that the US will be exporting its shale gas to the UK , as the country has gone from a net importer to net exporter of gas . It has become a booming industry and gas companies are very excited about a number of new ventures in the country , particularly in the current fracking capital of the world " Texas . <h> British Shale gas <p> Britain is a long way behind the US in the shale gas industry , but the government thinks the fledgling industry could be a key means to help the economy recover from recession and create energy security for the UK . So much so that the Government has proposed slashing production taxes on gas by half . <p> Opposition in the UK has been fierce however , with demonstrations by activists at test sites and opposition from politicians and local communities . So much so that some companies have scaled back their operations already . <h> Environmental concerns for investing in Shale Gas <p> Shale gas is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it a means to perpetuate fossil fuels ( shale gas produces at least the same , if not more carbon emissions than traditional natural gas ) , it also harbours other environmental concerns discussed below . <p> The water and chemical mix pumped into the ground has to come out somewhere , and despite careful efforts to prevent groundwater pollution , there is always the possibility that contamination could occur , damaging water supplies in the local area . <p> Fracking uses up vast quantities of water , which is mixed with chemicals to help extract the gas . In some parts of the US there have been concerns about water shortages as a result of the extraction . <p> There are of course , emissions from the use of the natural gas produced , as there are with natural gas extracted from other means . The nature of the extraction technique means that it is likely further emissions occur as gas moves up towards the surface gas , as not 100% of the gas is collected . <p> For those in the locality , fracking produces noise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the site . This is usually the primary objection for local residents . <p> There have been some questions over seismic disturbances caused by fracking as well . Although it is hotly refuted by the gas companies there are concerns that the small earthquakes could detrimentally affect the local area . <p> So it is easy to see why there have been so many opponents and demonstrations . Whereas oil and gas drilling has traditionally been done in remote or sea locations , fracking in Britain is unfortunately likely to take place in areas of natural beauty or populated areas of the country . It is therefore understandable that there will be more opposition than has been seen in other environmentally damaging industries . <p> Perhaps the most damaging news for environmentalists though , is that it could lower the price of gas , and reduce the investment in renewable technologies , which have shown significant progress in the last decade . It is worrying that the Government is seriously considering such a big tax break for such a disruptive and backward thinking technology . <p> Thanks for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your points however . Although fracking may reduce recorded CO2 emissions in the short term , Gas is not a long term solution to climate change and encouraging the fracking industry to the detriment of renewables will ultimately lead to increased emissions and more climate headaches . <p> Although natural gas creates less emissions on combustion compared to coal , there is very little research into the emssions created by escaped gas during the fracking process some fear this makes fracking emissions greater than coal but this is not reflected in the official figures that are used to give a total carbon emissions figure . <p> You also do n't  mention the environmental impact of fracking , which will cause water shortage issues in already arid regions of the world , and has the potential to pollute ground water .

These heaters are not storage heaters in the conventional sense and do not utilise Economy tariffs in any meaningful way , infact , they are extremely expensive to run if you remain on an Economy tariff . Indeed , Fischer recommend that they are run utilising ordinary tariffs . Given that all resistive electric heaters are 100% efficient in converting electricity to heat , no matter what type of electric heater is used the number of kilowatt hours needed to generate a comfortable temperature in any room will be the same .

But we found that the sales rep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to give a deposit on the day . Also they were very expense to buy . There are definitely cheaper heating options out there <p> I 've just had the very same experience with Fischer rep .

He would not stop talking about how great the finance deal was and that to fit a wet system would cost so much more ! ! Heaven help a frail OAP who would be conned out of their money . <p> We have just taken a call about the Fisher heating system with someone quoting the same price . Really not sure about them to be honest . I think people should begin to move away from storage heaters especially mainly because the amount of electricity at night available ( mainly from nuclear plants that ca n't be turned off ) is going to drop over the next 5-10 years . The nuclear plants are reaching the end of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they will be replaced with gas power plants on the whole ( nuclear plants take so long to build and also many people are very anti nuclear ) . Therefore as night time electricity gets more scarce the price will go up , so while the principle of the storage heater is good ( and to be honest new storage heaters work well now ! ) I think if you are investing in a new heating system I would look at other forms of heating . <p> I had a quote done by Fischer for 2 large storage heaters to be installed in my living room ( 60 square meters ) and the total , with installation and remote programming system , came to -3235 that I can pay on an interest-free loan ( Barclays ) over 2 years .

The top quality dimplex quantum heaters are around -500 each . Even with installation you wont be paying more than -1,500 . <p> I moved into a new property in August of last year and I have Quantam storage heaters in the livingroom and the hall and the more traditional Dimplex heaters in the two bedrooms . Whilst the Quantam heaters certainly offer more in terms of controlability and being better insulated to prevent heat loss , there is the issue of the running cost of the fan which runs any time you set for the heater to be on . Now unless you are some sort of a night owl , this means that the fan runs at peak hours and costs more to run than if the heat was just using natural convection like the old Dimplex heaters . It seems wholly unnecessary to me to have forced convection like this during periods of use that occur during peak electricity rates . The heater is so well insulated that if you do not run the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even give radiant heat . The Dimplex heaters can retain their heat if the input is up to a reasonable level and the output is put to its lowest setting and this provides a constant radiant as well as convective heat that seems better at keeping the room at a comfortable temperature all day . I have found the Quantam heater to be expensive to run because I have it on the home all day setting as my missus suffers from chronic anaemia and this I think is down to the unnecessary forced convection using the fan . Any thoughts on this would be gratefully appreciated . Thanks Alan <p> Hi Alan , so we often get people complaining about storage heaters , be it old fashioned or new the quantum range . Not only are they unhappy with the efficiency but also temperature control and cost . That 's why we are seeing a huge amount of interest in Infrared heating panels .

I have been trying to get advice from fischer but I am fed up calling them as they keep saying their tech team will call me back but so far no one has bothered . I now have trading standards involved as the salesman promised me these were cheaper to run than my old storage heaters . I am upset that I have been mis sold these heaters and I am dreading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . <p> Hi Tony , I think you mean dimplex rather than duplex ? I would be very surprised if the storage heaters you have been recommended are more efficient . All electric heaters heat the bricks at the same efficiency , it is the ability to keep the heat in for later in the day and the controls on the heater that ultimately save you money on your bills . <p> Dimplex have some of the best heat storage technology on the market with their quantum range , and the controls are second to none . Whilst I 'm sure the Fischer heaters will do the job , I cant see how they would be cheaper to run although they should be cheaper to install . <p> Having said that your credit deal sounds good , so good luck whatever you choose !

You can get yourself a pack for just -20 , so it is a straightforward way to get that little bit extra out of your heating system . <p> productbox id= " 9403 ? /productbox <p> Radfans are another way to optimise your radiators . They are little units that sit on top of your radiator and blow the warm air around the room . They have a small built in fan that kicks in when the air around the unit gets warm . Simply letting the warm air diffuse around the room means the room takes longer to heat , and you end up needing a larger radiator to do the same amount of work . <h> Bleeding radiators <p> One of the easiest ways to improve the efficiency of your heating system is to bleed the radiators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the radiator " by doing this , hot water can now fill the entire radiator , so the whole thing will get hot . If you notice there is a discrepancy between the temperature at the top and the bottom of the radiators , this is a pretty good sign that it requires bleeding . <h> Flushing your central heating system <p> Over the years , most central heating system will fill with all sorts of sludge , rust and other debris . A power flush is the process of cleaning out all this debris from the system , which will help ensure that the heating system works more efficiently . The aim of the power flush is to help restore full circulation of the heating system , to allow warm water to easily travel through the pipework , radiators and boiler . As a result of getting this done , the radiators will warm more quickly and they should get warmer than before ; they should also no longer have cold spots on them . Power flushing the central heating system leads to a more reliable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heat the home for less ! <h> Install a Magnaclean Filter on your central heating system <p> A Magnaclean filter is a device that is installed on the return pipework of the heating system . The filter works by swirling the incoming water ( heading back to the boiler ) around a really strong magnetic core . The magnetic core attracts all the ferro-magnetic debris ( read rust ! ) , catching it before it enters the boiler itself . <p> If you have just power flushed the system , then it really makes sense installing one of these , since it will help keep the system sludge free . <h> Adding Inhibitor to your hot water system <p> Inhibitor is a liquid inserted into your central heating system that that slows down the reaction of the metal radiator with the water running through it . This oxidisation is what causes lots of the sludge in the radiator , so by using inhibitor , you can slow the rate of this reaction and help keep your system running in tip top condition ! <p> productbox id= " 53445 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which works by reducing the surface tension of water . This change essentially reduces the size of the bubbles that form in the boiler feeder tube helping to maximise heat transfer across the heat exchanger . This means that every unit of gas goes on to produce more hot water and therefore it should result in lower energy bills . The actual effectiveness of these products is still disputed , but at only -20 -30 a pop " even a 1% saving in energy bills would still cover the cost of buying it in just a couple of years ( they do say you can expect to see savings of 10% plus though ! ) <h> Heating Controls <p> Good quality heating controls really make a difference " in some cases actually saving you more money than a new boiler ! Get yourself a good , easy to use thermostat and thermostatic controls for your radiators ( known as TRVs ) . You might also want to consider an intelligent heating control system such as the Heat Genius solution . Many of our customers have come back to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such systems " since they give you fine ( remote ) control over your heating . <h> Condensing Boiler <p> Getting a new boiler is sometimes the best option . A modern boiler can be up to 90% efficient and you can get -270 cashback on the Green Deal , as well as substantial finance towards the installation costs . <p> If you do decide to replace your existing boiler with a new one , we really recommend getting a power flush at the same time , as you do n't want the sludge and other debris reducing the effectiveness of your new investment ! <p> As a final point , if you do decide to go for a new boiler , remember , that there is no reason why you ca n't use the tips above to make your gas bills even lower ! <h> 4 comments <p> I like the idea of the inhibitor , but how exactly do you add it to your heating system ? My boiler really is on its last legs so anything that might eek another couple of years out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing waiting until it dies except if your existing boiler is very old . Some boilers are running at less than 65% efficiency , while a new boiler may run at 90%+ efficiency so the energy savings from installing the replacement means that you should n't delay !

Bioethanol is already the most commonly used biofuel- in the world , and is- especially- prominent in- Brazil . <h> Bioethanol used for electricity generation <p> Burning bioethanol via combustion produces- a lower thermal energy output than other thermoelectric generating processes from fuels such as coal or oil . To generate the same level of energy and electricity a much larger stock of Bioethanol is required .

@@36748912 @5748912/ <h> Introduction to Hot Water Cylinders <h> Heating <p> There are two types of hot water cylinders found in homes today . The newer pressurised unvented hot water tanks and the older style vented hot water tanks . <h> Unvented hot water cylinders <p> Unvented hot water cylinders were only made legal in the UK in 1986 , but have since grown rapidly in popularity . In an unvented system there is no cold water tank " instead , the sealed hot water cylinder is fed directly by the cold water mains . Since they are operating at mains pressure , they offer much better flow rates , meaning your shower and bath performance should be higher . <p> The other major benefit is that you do n't need to maintain a cold water tank in the loft ( which vented systems require ) . This is good news since not only does it free up space , it also removes the potential freezing issue during our long cold winter periods . <p> In addition , since you are n't relying on gravity to move the hot water around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much anywhere in your property . <p> Other advantages of installing an unvented system include reduced noise in the system ( since there is no cold water filling of the water storage cistern ) , and since there is no water storage cistern and the system is essentially sealed , the cold water is not at risk from contamination . <h> Unvented water cylinders and the water expansion issue <p> Since water increases in volume as it gets warm , unvented cylinders need to include a mechanism that allows the expansion to take place , thereby keeping the cylinders operating at a safe pressure . <p> There are two methods of allowing this expansion to take place safely . The first is the bubble top unit , which uses an internal air bubble that is produced and trapped at the top of the cylinder when it is installed . The other type is the external expansion unit that utilises an expansion vessel to contain the expanded hot water . <p> The major issue with unvented hot water cylinders is that since hot water flow depends on the cold water main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned off , your home will be without access to any hot water . <p> Since unvented hot water tanks operate at higher pressure than vented systems and have additional safety features installed , these cylinders need to be installed by boiler specialists who hold- a qualification that complies with G3 of building regulations . This means they tend to be far more expensive to install than traditional vented hot water systems . <h> Vented hot water systems <p> Vented hot water tanks are still the most common type of hot water system found in the UK . Unlike newer unvented tanks , these copper tanks are fed by cold water from a header tank ( normally located in the loft ) and they use gravity to drive the hot water around the home . A vent pipe links the vented hot water cylinder and the cold water in the header tank . <p> As with the unvented system , expansion of warm water is still an issue , but in this case the expansion simply takes place via the vent pipe and in the header tank . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the water tank above the tap or shower feed . This means that although on the ground floor of the home the pressure might be excellent , in rooms on upper floors the pressure will be lower . As a result , many showers in homes with vented hot water tanks use electric pumps to drive the hot water to the shower at increased pressure . <p> Vented hot water cylinders are far less complicated than the pressurised vented systems and for this reason they are much simpler to maintain and install . This makes them a far cheaper option when compared to the unvented system . <h> Indirect systems <p> Most hot water cylinders are heated via an external heat source such as a gas boiler or solar thermal . In this case the hot water is heated and then travels through a copper coil in the hot water tank . The heat is then transferred from the from the external heat source to the water inside the hot water tank . <p> Indirect cylinders tend to be fitted with a direct backup ( such as a immersion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can still produce hot water as and when you need it . <p> You can get both vented and unvented indirect systems . <h> Direct systems <p> In a direct cylinder system , the hot water is heated directly by an internal element such as an immersion heater . The hot water tends to be more expensive to produce in direct systems . Some homes have no access to gas , for example a mid-level flat . In this case they are forced to go with a direct system for their hot water , so they may choose to take advantage of Economy 7 , which will give them a cheaper electricity at night to heat the hot water with . <p> Normally this type of cylinder would be fitted with two different immersion heaters , one for the peak electricity and one for the off-peak electricity . If this is the case , you really need to make sure that the immersion heaters are set up on the timers correctly to ensure you are paying the least possible for the hot water . There is no point heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night . <p> You can get both vented and unvented direct systems . <h> Combi boilers <p> We have covered combi boilers in more detail- here , however it is worth mentioning that they can produce hot water for your home without the need for a hot water cylinder . While you can use electric point of use hot water heaters , gas currently is about -+ of the price of electricity . Therefore it makes sense to use gas to heat the water as well as to carry out your heating . <p> The issue with combi boilers is that since they operate at mains water pressure , as soon as there is a pressure drop ( i.e. more than one tap is opened in the home ) then the hot water pressure is split between the two outlets . They are however ideal for smaller properties since there is no need to store hot water which is not very energy efficient . <h> Installing energy saving technologies <p> Are you use local installer map . <h> 27 comments <p> Our unvented cylinder has been working fine throughout the winter despite the adjacent expansion vessel being apparently idle and showing nil pressure . I turn the re-pressurizing valve and nothing changes . Dead . But we still have hot water and central heating throughout the house . Even with the lodgers . Is this unusual ? . <p> I am fitting a new shower , my existing hot water system comprises a cold water tank in the loft , a hot water storage tank at the same floor level as the shower . The height from the bottom of the water tank in the loft to the head of the shower is only 1 metre giving 0.1 bar of pressure , so a low pressure system , the pipe to the shower is 15 mm dia , what range of mixer showers are available to suit this low pressure system <p> We have a new home and have an unvented water cylinder system.One of the requirements to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system service by an unvented registered engineer on an annual basis.How can I find out where I can get this service.we currently have the boiler serviced by British Gas but not the cylinder system <p> Hi there , weve just bought a rental property that has a very complex ( apparently ) hot water system .

I have some pictures . There is a timeclock in the airing cupboard too , along with the very high-tech looking weird gear ! <p> Very useful page , thank you .

We have solar panels installed and have no boiler as we are all electric . Currently heating hot water at night with economy 7 but would prefer to take advantage of heating our hot water directly instead of sending energy back to the grid . Tank is 4ft high and probably 18 inch circumference without the foam insulation . Where can I find a company in Sussex or Kent who would swap this tank over for me and what tank should I be looking for .

It is an indirect system powered by heat pump . How would the immersion be operated in the event of a boiler breakdown ? <p> Hi Emma There can only be a couple of faults causing immersion not to work . Most probable cause is the immersion element has gone open circuit and would have to be replaced ( you would have to drain the tank first ) The thermostat may be faulty , but you can change that without draining . You should have a switch to switch on and off . Should be economical to have an electrician diagnose the cause , as it would be a 5 minute job to diagnose <p> Hi Frances , You can get dual or even triple coil tanks , it just depends how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boiler would require a dual coil . A boiler and a heat pump + a wood burner ( that produces hot water too ) would require 3 feeds . More coils , the more expensive the tank and the bigger it needs to be . <p> Is that last paragraph really true that combi boilers are ideal for smaller properties ? I have a very small house , with 4.5kw of central heating , and the major suppliers do not make a combi boiler which can service such a small central heating requirement without significant loss of efficiency . Perhaps smaller properties might be better suited to a system boiler with an unvented hot water cylinder . <p> Deborah , That is indeed a very small heat requirement , and probably the exception rather than rule . Still , in a very small property , the advantage of a combi is the extra space you gain from not having all those extra tanks around that is a big advantage when space is at a premium . 
@@36748913 @5748913/ <h> Do storage heaters still have a place in the home ? <h> September 3 , 2013 <p> Update : - As nuclear and coal stations are wound down in the UK , this could mean the death of the Economy 7 tariff . This would mean storage heaters becoming more expensive to run , and as such we no longer recommend people install new storage heaters . Read our latest advice- here- under The future of storage heaters . <h> What is a storage heater ? <p> A storage heater is an electrical form of heating , designed to take advantage of cheap , night time electricity in order to heat the home cost-effectively . It was particularly popular in the UK during the 1970s , when the electricity companies devised the Economy 7 tariff - a way to increase demand for electricity in the middle of the night , by offering cheaper electricity at this time . The reason for this is that coal power plants take time to power down , so they were invariably left on through the night . Storage heaters are also often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grid . <h> How do storage heaters work ? <p> Historically , storage heaters were installed to charge ' during the night , utilising cheaper electricity from the grid and then heat ceramic or concrete blocks within the heater . When it is daytime they will stop charging and then release the stored heat throughout the day . Some storage heaters are equipped with a fan assisting dissipater , which then also helps regulate the temperature of the room . <p> Storage heaters are nearly always found in conjunction with a two-tariff meter . These are easily identified as there will be two numbers on your meter and you will have a day and night rate listed on your bill . The other way to identify a two-tariff meter is that it contains 02 ' as the first two digits on your MPAN ' number . <h> Are they more efficient than gas central heating ? <p> The answer is almost always no . The cost of electricity is a lot higher than it used to be , and even given the cheaper night rate , equivalent heating with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an Economy 7 tariff , you are going to be paying a premium for your peak electricity . So you will be paying more for your appliances , cooking and everything else you use your electricity for , unless you can use them more at night . Refer to our recent Economy 7 tariff blog for more on how to take advantage of the off peak rate . <h> So why would I want to install a storage heater now ? <p> There are two reasons which might prompt you to install storage heaters : <p> Firstly , if you produce your own electricity ( via solar PV , a wind turbine or hydroelectric ) , invariably it is better to use the electricity that you produce in the home since it costs more- to buy from the grid than you would get paid for exporting it. - Therefore if you use this electricity you produce during the day to charge ' your storage heater , you can then release the heat throughout the evening when you get home . <p> Secondly , you may not be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you live in a high-rise block of flats for example . Economy 7 tariffs do still exist , so if you have old style storage heaters you may wish to replace them with new energy efficient varieties . <h> Can I still buy storage heaters ? <p> Yes . Modern heaters can be more efficient than the older style ones , and less bulky . But it 's still only worth it if you are off the gas grid or you have excess electricity to use as discussed above . <p> If you have more disposable income , then you may be better served installing an air source heat pump , because running costs are actually much lower than storage heaters , however the upfront investment is a lot higher . From spring 2014 , if you have an MCS installed air source heat pump you will benefit from the Renewable Heat Incentive , which is a payment you will receive based on the amount of renewable heat produced . <h> Features of newer storage heaters <h> Fan assisted storage heaters <p> Some heaters have a fan to assist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually more efficient as they are almost always better insulated and therefore have more control over the release of heat , however- this can be an issue for allergy sufferers , as dust is blown around the room . <h> Controls on storage heaters <p> The controls for the heaters are often tricky to understand and vary from model to model , but there are a few aspects that are usually the same : <p> Power switches this determines whether you are using off-peak or on-peak electricity to charge the storage heater . The on peak switch is only usually on when the heater has not been charged sufficiently overnight , or it is exceptionally cold . The off peak one is usually off during summer when you do n't  require heating , but on throughout the- winter months . <p> Input and output controls the input control determines how much electricity the storage heater will use to charge ( and therefore the amount of available heat the storage heater has once charged ) . The output control determines the rate at which the storage heater emits the stored heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thermostatic controls , which help- you to keep the room at a certain temperature they essentially replace the functionality of the output controls . <p> Please remember- not to use peak time electricity to keep the room up to temperature unless absolutely necessary since this is an incredibly expensive way to heat the home ! <h> Final thoughts <p> Storage heaters were historically installed to take advantage of cheaper electricity available at night . If you do n't have access to a gas central heating system and you have old storage heaters in place , there are now far more energy efficient varieties on the market so it is worth swapping them out . In addition , if you are creating your own electricity , installing new storage heaters is an elegant way of maximising the amount of electricity you produce in the home ( which is preferable as discussed elsewhere ) . <h> FROM -649.99 <p> The price of a new storage heater will start at about -650 for the best models and obviously increase depending on the size you are looking to get . <p> Have a read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; stylish form of electric heating HERE . <h> Advantages of storage heaters <p> Utilises cheap electricity during the night , meaning that they are cheaper than standard electrical heaters . <p> The home will be warm when you wake up in the morning . <p> Cheaper to install than a central heating system and cheaper to maintain and run . <h> Issues with storage heaters <p> There is unavoidable heating of the property overnight as the heater is charged , which can be wasteful if not required . <p> It is difficult to deal with sudden changes of weather . The amount of charge ' is set the night before , so if you need more heat than expected the next day you will have to use more costly peak time heating . If you overcharge the heater however , you will be wasting electricity generating heat that is not required and overheating your property . If you go out and do n't need to heat the home , the heat will seep out anyway , even if the fan is off , so it is n't a particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariffs by installing non-standard meters . Switching companies for your supplier then becomes prohibitively expensive . <p> The units themselves tend to be large and bulky , although modern heaters are now significantly smaller . <p> The size also dictates how much charge ' the heater can take , so although you can get smaller heaters , they may not be able to provide all the heat you need . <p> The controls can be complicated and therefore it is easy to use the heater inefficiently or ineffectively . <h> Installing storage heaters find you a local installer for storage heaters , just fill in the form below and we will be in touch shortly ! <p> Interested in installing storage heaters ? 184572 @qwx384572 <h> 61 comments <p> I 've had economy 7 electric storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 27 years and i 'm very happy with the whole system . its clean and does n't  affect the air quality and us very safe ti use , i live in a one bedroom flat and my electric cost a year is approx six hundred pounds a year and i have everything electric , i would hate to switch to gas as its dirty , affects your air quality and has to be serviced every year . i admit it takes a bit of getting used to the controls but my rule is to turn it on at the end of october and leave it on the lowest setting untill april 1st when i turn heaters off . the water is on all year and is very convenient and cheap . <p> Storage Heaters tend to get a bad press , possibly because they 're now seen as old-fashioned technology , but Ive run Economy 7 heaters for 30 years and I actually prefer them to having a gas boiler , ( at least in a small property ) . I admit they 're not as controllable as other forms of heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the night when they store up heat again , but they normally offer a comfortable , ambient temperature that remains the same , day or night . With gas you 're forever looking at the temperature gauge , wondering if you 're feeling a bit chilly and whether or not you need to turn the heat up . With storage heaters , you can basically switch them on at the wall and forget about them at least until our 2 weeks of Summer arrives . Also gas boilers can be dangerous Storage Heaters do n't  give out carbon monoxide or leak potentially explosive gasses . Gas boilers need to be regularly serviced whereas storage heaters do n't  . Gas boilers also have a shorter life and are more expensive to replace . And they and their radiators make noises ! <p> I agree with what you say , I find this to and being in a flat I only use two out of the three installed .

I look after a holiday cottage with these heaters and would like to switch them on the day before I go there , so it is warm on arrival . Any ideas ? <p> Wont go into why , but we are restricted to having E7 storage heaters . These are now over 20 years old so I 'm thinking of changing them to Dimplex Quantum .

Our storage heaters have only one feed , this is the off-peak feed and it is only active during off peak . Storage heaters are not very smart devices , they do n't  know the time , so they can not decide themselves whether it is off=peak time or not . If you only have one feed to your heaters then you will need further wiring to drive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not need a new consumer unit , because the feed required for peak time use will be relatively low , so you may be able to run it from the existing circuit for your plugs . <p> We have just moved into a flat with cement ceiling and floors and brick walls , currently using old storage heaters .

Family members have warned us about the insulation but were wondering if the cement ceiling and floors are enough insulation ? Any advice would be gratefully accepted . <p> I have an unheated conservatory that I would like to actually use during the spring evenings , could i heat a storage heater during the peak sun of the midday from my PV system using excess energy and use the heat in the evening for a couple of hours ?

I know this is the most expensive time to use the heater but would it still be cheaper than having the storage heater going all night to then release the heat during the day when were not home ? <p> I have storage heater and I hate them , I have the older type where there is no fan .

My partner and I have just moved into a 25yr old flat . It uses old storage heaters currently . We are currently on an eco 7 tariff with an immersion heater hot water tank ( which looks like the original tank put in when the flat was built ) . There is no gas option available and as the building is listed I do not think we would be allowed to but an air source heat pump box on the outside of the building . <p> As far as I can make out we have the option of upgrading our storage heaters or changing to electric radiators ( which would also mean changing our boiler and electricity plan ) . <p> In your experience/opinion which of these is likely to be more cost effective in the long run ? Also , which comapny/companies do the best/better storage heaters ? <p> Hi Phil , so if you want to go for like for like we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retain their charge better than the old style storage heaters and they are also fan assisted so will push the heat around the room more effectively . <p> I would n't suggest swapping to conventional electric panel heaters to be honest .

The reason storage heaters are popular is because they take advantage of Economy 7 , so you can charge them at night when the cost of electricity is cheaper hence even though they are electric , they are considered more cost effective . <p> If you want to do away with storage heaters altogether , take a look at infrared heating it is more efficient than conventional electric heating because it is radiant heating not convection ! <p> Thank you for your reply . We have had a quote from Fisher who claim their heaters are much cheaper to run than normal storage heaters , although their installation is expensive ( around -7000 ) . Do you have any experience/thoughts about Fisher heating systems ? It seems it would take a long time to recoup these costs ( especially as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fisher systems are , in some cases , cheaper to run and more comfortable than storage heaters . This is mostly because of the superior time and temperature controls that they are able to offer . However , the benefits ( and with that the savings ) are limited due to it still being a convection method of heating through electricity . <p> When you say " Modern heaters can be more efficient than the older style ones " , presumably you mean in terms of their ability to release the heat to the room at the desired time ( through better insulation and fans ) ? <p> Hi Andrew , exactly . One of the biggest problems with the older storage heaters is that they would charge during the night ( on the economy 7 tariff ) but then by the time people want to use the heat the next evening when home from work , the storage heaters would have leaked all their stored heat , so they would need the booster to actually do anything . <p> The new Quantum storage heaters minimise this leakage and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space . <p> Really ? I think this is misleading . Storage heaters are more efficient than gas central heating as practically all the electrical energy consumed is converted into heat , unlike that of gas ( granted you may have less control on how you use this heat ) . The cost of the commodity used to heat your house has no reflection on the actual efficiency of the system installed in your home . <p> Matt , You are correct in that purely on efficiency , electric heating always wins , but it is hard to ignore the huge cost savings from a gas system electric heating just does n't  compare when you take into account the unit cost of the fuel . <p> If i chose the infrared herschel 600 Watt panel , is the optiplug compatible with the thermostat . Ideally i would have the panel and the thermostat in the garage conversion room , and would use the optiplug as well . However , if it was a cloudy day and we werent producing enough free electricity thru the solar panels , and the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 17 , and temp in room was 16 , then presumably i could either switch the optiplug to manual , to allow the thermostat to start up the infrared panel using electricity from the grid , or leave the plug on automatic , knowing that the thermostat couldnt start the panel as we werent producing any free electricity . Is this assumption correct ? <p> Presumable your email would say that it would be worth me considering the infrared panel heaters ( you mention these elsewhere on the web site ) , and a 600W one should be sufficient for this sized room , and using it in conjunction with an optiplug , would ensuere that during the day , it would only switch on when we had excess free electricity from the solar panels <p> Hi Ian , If you have electricity to use ( and you are not looking for a heat pump heating solution ) , then you have three options a convection panel , a new storage heater or as you mention infrared heating . Any of those would work as you mentioned above ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will send something over to your email later this afternoon a few suggestions as if we were living in the property . But I can say from what you have described you are doing everything right in terms of your existing heating management and general awareness for energy efficiency . <p> We have a 1989 built 4 bed house in the midlands . We had a new combi boiler fitted a year ago , and also had a 4Kw solar pv system fitted 20 mths ago , which has produced 7200Kw since . We have gas CH , but are considering having a garage conversion to one of our double attached garages ( which can only garage the smallest of cars ) , but could give us an additional room of approx 15 feet by 9 feet , which we could use as an office/dining room/2nd sitting room . My question is , rather than add a conventional radiator and pipe work and connect up to the existing gas heating system , would it be financially worth considering , a single electric storage heater instead , and if so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that size of room.Our EPC rating before the PV panels were put on was 67 ( C ) , and since then , we have doubled the loft insulation , switched all bulbs to low energy ones , and added TRVs to all radiators . So with the PV panels should now have an EPC of 80+ . Also , what would be the average yearly running costs of such a single storage heater . During winter months we have the CH thermostat set to 17 , between 07:00-16:00,18 between 16:00-23:00 and 11 between 23:00-07:00 , and is usually mostly switched off between May/Oct . <p> we live in a 1960s 4/5 bedroom house . We have just had the loft insulated and the cavity retro filled with polystyrene beads , all for free by the Mark Group . We have also had all new double glazing recently . The only insulation that remains for us to do is between the ground floor and first floor + plus improve the curtains we have to cover up the extensive area of glass we have during the night . <p> We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blown air heating via a very large storage heater on the Eco7 tariff . I have had extensive conversations with Dimplex re Eco7 Vs panel heaters on a normal tarif . Dimplex are adamant we should remain on Eco7 and if we want to replace the blown air system it should be with the modern style intelligent Storage heaters . <p> My question is the same a Helen Rs above and I think that of at least one other and that 's how do you get the energy from solar pv into the storage heaters ? Obviously you want to use the solar energy as you create it but our system only charges at night . <p> I have spoken with several electricians who install solar panels but none of them have any idea how to tie it directly into Eco7 storage heaters ? <p> I have solar PV and old immersion heaters . I also have a immersion hot water tank which is old and uninsulated which I do n't  use it at all ( we use the electric shower and an A-rated dishwasher instead ) . <p> So how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soak up all the Watts I generate during the day that are not used by the dishwasher etc. ? Is there a smart meter that will identify how much power is being generated , and importantly unused by appliances that take priority , and trickle it into the heaters during the day so I can use the heat later when I need warmth in the evenings ? If not , why not ? ! ! ! There should be ! <p> My problem is this . I live in a 1970s bungalow off road , down a long narrow track . I have inherited gas bottles and a truly ancient boiler . What I most dislike is the fact I have to reorder ever 2 or 3 weeks . I wan above all a continuous supply so I do n't  have to worry about running out . I have been exploring ( and discounting ) various options . I already have solar water heating and am considering getting solar pvs . I am concerned about both cost and being green . <p> 1 . get a big LPG tank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to my house to refill 2 . Air and ground heat pumps . My house can not be insulated enough and air pump is not 100% continuous if v cold 3. biomass wood pellets seem to be some hazards and I do n't  think I have enough space 4 . Oil most firms only have 100ft hoses and my tank would be about 110-115 feet from road access . <p> That 's why I have been thinking about Night Storage heaters . <p> I have a log stove I can use when I am in for extra heat in the evening or when really cold weather . <p> I am having solar PVs installed and possibly night storage heters to replace gas bottles . But I cant see how this works because you assume people are out during the day whereas I am retired and in all the time . So would my solar " charge " the system at day or night or both ? ? ? <p> Hi Maeve , The solar PV only will work when there is daylight , so they will not help charge your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to boost them during the day , they could help there . The most important thing with storage heaters is to make sure you are on economy 7 ( dual ) tariff . IF you are not , it will mean switching your meter over and this will be costly . This does ensure that you are paying a cheap rate at night when you need to charge the heaters , and can use the PV during the day to keep your peak electricity use to a minimum . <p> I decided to get rid of my old storage heaters because they were just too big and never held their heat store until the evening . I know have radiant heating panels in all rooms and they are fantastic , you simply turn them when you need a burst of heat , no waiting for the room to warm so they must be more energy efficient ! <p> Hi Diedre What type and make of radiant heating panels did you instal ? I have an all electric flat with 13 year old storage heaters that I only live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I arrive on a Friday and I do not need the flat to stay warm when I have gone on a Monday ? <p> If I am not on Economy 7 are storage heaters worth installing . We do n't  have gas in the home and we just have little electric panel heaters . The issue is I know the energy providers are going to be limited in the tariffs they can offer in the near future and I wonder whether the economy 7 will be scrapped ? <p> Hi Maggie thanks for your comment . In all honesty , I cant see these being scrapped since so many people have storage heaters and they are still available today . In addition , although much of our slow reactive power generation is due to come offline by the end of the decade ( nuclear and coal power plants ) , wind turbines produce more energy at night so there will always be excess electricity in the grid at this time . <p> We have an old detached property right on the beach in Cumbria , which we let as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaters which we need to replace as they put the heat out during the day but have little left by evening . Would you recommend newer storage heaters such as Quantum or is there a better option ? There is no gas supply to the cottage and also we need an easy system which guests wont have to supplement or adjust . <p> Hello James , I live at the coast in south west Scotland in an all electric ( 3 phase ) 1 bedroom ground floor flat measuring 110m2 . The west facing living room measures 30.50m2 its only outside wall is practically all glass with a glass balcony door all are upvc double glazed , another wall shares the communal entrance area of the building which is not heated . What size heaters would you recommend for the living room , at present 1 measures 800cm the other 1m . I would like to renew the heaters throughout the flat to efficient , economical to run heaters using my Economy 7 tarriff , if that is the best way . I have Dimplex and Rointe brochures although I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the fan part of the Quantum works from a seperate socket not connected to the Economy 7 tarriff , which is disappointing and there may be a bit of a noise from the fan . What make and model of heaters do you recommend for the whole flat , including the above makes . Also my 1.2m high 4 part copper hot water cylinder dating back to 1968/70 I would like too change it to a modern smaller instant type with high volume and flow with little or no storage to do my basin , shower , kitchen and able to run all at the same time and perhaps a washing appliance , I see on line 3 phase Zip and Stiebel makes or are they not for domestic use should I just replace it with a much more modern materialed , well insulated economical to run same size or smaller cylinder , again which size make and model would you recommend . Thanking you <p> I have 15 year old storage heaters and installed solar panels last August . How do I get my storage heaters to charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar ? Do I need to buy a newer type of storage heater ? <p> Hi Ivor , First of all , it would be worth while upgrading your storage heaters anyway . This is because they have a lifespan of around 10 years and upgrading could save around -150 per year , if not more . Storage heaters are included in the Green Deal , so this , and the Cashback , may be something that you could benefit from . What I would recommend would be to link the Solar PV system to your immersion heater through the use of a Solar PV Optimiser . While you need hot water all year round , the need for heat is only really seen during periods of low electrical generation through the Solar Panels in winter . In theory you can link your Panels and Storage heaters ( using a Solar PV Optimiser ) , but the amount of electricity they would be provided with , using a standard domestic system , means you would be unlikely to feel the difference when you need it most . <p> Hi Molly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Qauntum range is the one you should take a look at since these are included within the Green Deal click here to take a look at their brochure . <p> Hi there . I have bought a new home and removed the storage heaters and installed central heating not realising that I would have to get permission from the garage owners at the end of the road to allow BGas to put the pipes in . I need to move in urgently and am now with no heating or hot water ! Do you have any suggestions on how I can heat the home whilst the problem gets sorted . Some suggested using propane gas as a temporary solution and that the Glow-worm combi would work with that . Any ideas would be gratefully received . Thanks Lucy <p> Hi Lucy , to be honest different gases have different characteristics , so while in theory a boiler may be able to run on mains gas or Calor ( or another brand ) Bottled gas , it is more than likely that the boiler would need to be modified , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gas Safe engineer to do it might make it cost prohibitive . In terms of other options to get hot water now , your best bet is an electric shower they are really inefficient , but far more practical than boiling the kettle every time you need to clean yourself . In terms of heating , we do sell infrared heating panels , which are more efficient than traditional convection heating , but it is for you to decide whether you want to splash out ! Regardless i hope you get it sorted soon ! Best of luck ! <p> We installed storage heaters in a property that we rented ( mostly to students ) and found them to be a cheaper option to install than gas , but I had n't  realised that they were so sophisticated these days with fans in them etc , or that you can get them through the Green Deal . Pity the Green Deal was n't around then . <p> I have storage rads installed in my parents flat no gas option available . Now that I have " taught " them how best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs are a reasonable -900/year ( elec only for everything ) considering that they are both in their mid eighties and need the flat at a constant 23C ! Flat size is about 55m2 ) . I have extensive experience of storage rads from 20 years working in France where the technology is much advanced with rads activated by a control signal which can be used for integrated control of all elec heating systems etc . The rads themselves are considerably better too and aesthetically more pleasing with ultra slim versions and those that are controlled by remote thermostats with automatic charging control based upon energy use over the preceeding days and outdoor temp . Any storage rad is only useful in a well insulated building and properly controlled . <p> Completely agree Paul , to be honest all heating systems work best with a well insulated house and based on the fact using electricity is more expensive than gas to heat the home , the less heat that is wasted the better . It is absolutely key these are operated either using solar PV , to minimise the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure you can charge it at night . <p> Hi Gill , thanks very much for this they are indeed still made , in fact you can still get them under the Green Deal , although these are fan assisted storage heaters and are very different to the older models you may have come across . <p> We actually prefer to suggest them in conjunction with solar PV , to ensure you do n't  have to export any electricity ( it is 3x better to use the electricity you produce , rather than export it to the grid ) . <p> We are living in a time constantly calculating how to spend less money and be more economical with our energy . Therefore it is definitely worth considering these more efficient storage heaters that are available on the market now . <p> This solution is economically acceptable for the simple reason that it is cheaper to install than central heating systems and you can take advantage of cheap electricity during the night . <p> Definitely I will consider replacing my old storage heaters thanks TheGreenAge for the valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly a lot of heating required here LOL ) in Primrose Hill and up to now have been using storage heaters to heat the property . <p> Did n't  realise you have air source heat pumps and the Renewable Heat Incentive subsidy coming soon . Sounds perfect actually . But can you advise how I would be able to make a start in getting one of these installed as these storage heaters are taking up an unbelievable amount of space and rather un-stylish and ugly <p> Hi Sheri , that 's great ! Interesting you asked about the process we have detailed this in a blog that you can find by clicking here <p> Essentially what you need to do first is to insulate your home as best you can . So the roof and walls and also the floor if possible . Once you have reduced the heating demand for your home , it then becomes worth it to install a heat pump , since they operate at lower temperatures than traditional heating systems . <p> Installing a heat pump will mean you will also benefit from the Renewable Heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to launch . Is is a subsidy that will pay you for installing this technology and do so for the next 7 years , which should cover a large proportion ( if not all ) of the heat pump installation costs . 
@@36748914 @5748914/ <h> Is it cheaper to heat my home with gas or electricity ? <h> January 23 , 2014 <h> Is it cheaper to heat my home with gas or electricity ? <p> We get asked this question on a regular basis " and on the face of it , it has a very simple answer . <p> To buy one unit of mains gas ( measured in kWh ) you will pay about 4p / kWh . Conversely , - one unit of electricity from the mains ( also measure in kWh ) will cost you about 15p / kWh . <p> This means that gas is about 3-4 times cheaper than electricity per kWh . <p> However , there are other factors at play making the comparison far less black and white . <h> Gas boilers are not 100% efficient <p> This is the first thing that slightly complicates direct comparisons ; while an electric radiator will turn 1 kWh of electricity into 1 unit of heat ( i.e. they are 100% efficient ) , boilers wo n't " even a brand new boiler will only be about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new gas boiler is not as high as an electrical equivalent , based on the fact it is so much cheaper for each unit of gas , mains gas still wins ! It- does n't really make a difference to the equation . <h> What if you ca n't access mains gas ? <p> Of course , many properties across the UK do n't have access to grid gas . These people- can still run their home on gas , but it- will be in the form of LPG ( discussed below ) , and will almost certainly be more expensive than accessing it from the mains . <p> What can you do if you do n't  have one of these ? Gas Meter <p> However , it is more common for households living without mains gas to heat their homes using either heating oil or electricity as the fuel source . Recently there has even been a shift that has seen more people using biomass as a heating source . This has become an attractive option since it includes a subsidy payment for every unit of hot water produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> What is LPG gas ? <p> If you live off mains gas , and still want to run a gas boiler , you will have to use LPG . LPG stands for liquefied petroleum gas and is produced from a mixture of hydrocarbon gases ( e.g. butane and propane ) compressed to form a liquid . The benefit of compressing the fuel into a liquid is that you can store more of it ( compared to a gas ) , and therefore you will get away with a smaller storage tank . LPG tanks can be dug into the ground so as not to ruin the appearance of your garden.LPG is a very reliable and versatile heating solution for homes , provided you remember to refill the tank as required ! In addition , the majority of popular central heating boilers come in a version that runs off LPG instead of mains gas , so if you are used to a mains gas boiler you can be confident in the knowledge that you will get identical functionality . <h> Is heating oil or LPG cheaper than electricity ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whilst LPG is generally a little higher at 7.6p / kWh . <p> Once again then , if you need to choose between either of these and the flat rate electricity , then both the LPG and heating oil are a cheaper option . <p> Of course , if you are on an Economy 7 tariff , paying around 6p / kWh for the night rate and 16p / kWh for the day rate , with a storage heater system , the cost of heating with electricity starts to become more attractive . However , due to the increased day cost of electricity any appliance run throughout this period will be higher . This means that you will have to use around 40% of your electricity at night to make the numbers work , highlighting the fact that Economy 7 is n't for everyone . <h> Is bottled gas cheaper than electricity ? <p> Bottled gas can come in the form of butane or propane , and is typically used with portable gas fires . Costs vary wildly depending on the volume you buy , but the typical sizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 47kg bottles . As with most commodities , the more you buy , the cheaper the cost . But how does bottled gas compare to electricity as a heating fuel ? <p> In this section we are going to look at the cost of three different sizes of bottled gas canister . These prices were all found on the Internet and are all Calor gas canisters ( a brand that we hope most people will be familiar with ) . <p> So before we start we have to bear in mind two things : <p> The energy contained in propane is 46.44 megajoules per kg and <p> 1 kWh is equal to 3.6 megajoules <h> So for a 6kg Calor gas refill costing -24.50 : <p> 6 x 46.44 / 3.6 = 77.4kwh in 6kg <p> -24.5 / 77.4kWh = 31.6p / kWh <h> For a 13kg Calor gas refill costing -33.00 : <p> 13 x 46.44 / 3.6 = 167.7kwh in 13kg <p> -33 / 167.7kWh = 19.7p / kWh <h> For a 47kg Calor gas refill costing -85.00 : <p> 47 x 46.44 / 3.6 = 606.3kwh in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So buying Calor gas to heat your home is a lot more expensive than pretty much any other option , especially when you factor in an efficiency rating of less than 100% . If you can buy the larger Calor containers , you will be paying around the same as electric heating , but due to other options generally being available , we tend to advise people to stay away . <h> Renewables vs . Electricity <p> If you can afford the upfront cost , either a biomass boiler or a heat pump could be the best heating option for your home . Both of these technologies are considered renewable sources of heating , therefore entitling them to the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme , which pays the owner an amount for each kWh of hot water produced " more on this scheme can be found here . <p> A heat pump will have a coefficient of performance ( COP ) of approximately 3.5 . This means that for every 1 unit of electricity used it produces 3.5 units of useful heat . So if one unit ( kWh ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works out at just over 4p . This brings it very much in-line with mains gas heating . <p> With the biomass boiler , while the cost of the fuel is relatively high , the renewable heat incentive makes this a winner , numbers-wise . In one property we saw , the RHI over the- seven years equated to -49k worth of subsidy on a -22k biomass boiler install " now this was a huge house , but the numbers are still attractive even with far smaller properties . <h> The FINAL VERDICT Is it cheaper to heat your home with gas or electricity ? <p> Mains gas is the winner it is cheaper to heat your home with gas than electricity , provided you can get it from the mains . LPG and heating oil are the runners up , with electricity and bottled gas lagging behind in last place . The Renewable Heat Incentive obviously skews these figures particularly in relation to heat pumps which run off electricity , but as you can see from above , if a home is well insulated it will actually be by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bed the common misconception that heating your home with electric heaters is cheaper than using a combination of gas boiler and radiators . <h> Table of heating costs in the average home <p> Mains Gas " 4p / kWh <p> LPG Gas " 7.5p / kWh <p> Heating Oil " 6p / kWh <p> Bottled Gas " 14p " 32p / kWh <p> Electricity " 15p / kWh <h> Installing a new boiler <p> Are you thinking about local installer map . <p> &gt;&gt;&gt; GO TO OUR LOCAL INSTALLER MAP NOW &lt;&lt;&lt; Alternatively , if you would like us to find you a local installer to install a new boiler in your home , just fill in the form below and we will be in touch shortly ! <p> Need a new boiler ? 184572 @qwx384572 <h> 130 comments <p> Do these rates take into account the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For a rental property I am considering electric because of the lower maintenance costs . Boilers need an annual certificate , pipes and rads are prone to leaks . Of course , I 'll still need a water system but its less complicated without water heating . <p> Esther , Ecotricity , Ovo Energy and Green Energy are a few that spring to mind . One important thing to note , the way your home sources the power will not necessarily change as it is usually provided via the closest power station coal , gas , nuclear or wind for example . Just depends then where your home is located in proximity to the closest power station . However , by going for a green tariff you will ensuring that some of those proceeds go towards re-investment back into renewable and clean energy sources . <p> The article is fairly decent but considers efficiency of a gas boiler only so when making the heat . What about the heat transport and storage ? How much is the heat loss in all the insulated and uninsulated pipework in a house ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinders and radiators hidden either in walls and ceilings . Another 10-50% ? Do n't  forget that the gas boilers also use electricity , need costly servicing . Someone should really do up an article that compares the cost of running a completely electric heating system vs gas and include all heat loss , set up cost , servicing etc . How much do you pay to have your gas boiler checked every year ? Will you need to replace it in 10 years ? <p> Solar panels , appropriate thermostats and controls , cheaper electric central heating boilers with better reliability and far less servicing , good thermal store system and judicious use of high consumption of household gadgets , top-notch insulation , full LED light installation all help to reduce the cost of electricity.Yes , there are upfront costs . I wonder if people using " cheaper " fuel are less careful with how they use it ? If no mains gas get advice about a properly installed electric central heating boiler.My electrician told me recently that there is talk in the industry of the Department of energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15-20 years time . I cant verify this however ! I suppose this may depend on decisions about the potential disaster that is shale gas.Potentially far more devastating than nuclear.Insulate to the very best that you can . <p> The calculation for electricity cost here is almost certainly incorrect . Whilst it is true that the kwh rating is about 15p during the day , the calculation here assumes that no thermostat is operating . I live in a house with a EPC set at E ; which is very bad ; but I have been using electric oil heaters and the yearly bill is about -800 ; which is about the same as my previous house for oil heating and electricity combined . That house also had much better glazing and insulation generally . So the motto of this story is that electric heating can be about the same as oil , perhaps a little less . Also , if the thermal insulation of a house is significantly improved , the different between gas and electric becomes increasingly smaller . If one then also joins up with a green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be near zero emissions . It would help then if the myth about the cost of electric heating be dispelled and help create a greener more sustainable future . <p> @Fiona Clark : " Town Gas " is methane , or " Natural Gas " , not the propane/butane mix that is LPG . Methane is often liquified and transported in bulk carriers as LNG ( Liquified Natural Gas ) . As the article suggests , Mains Gas is about 4p / kWh and is a lot cheaper than bottled gas which costs between 14p " 32p / kWh , depending on the size of bottle . <p> Please can someone tell me whether so called town gas ( which I think is LPG gas stored in a central storage tank and then piped directly to your home but metered ) is much more expensive than just bottled gas and more expensive than oil fired heating We already have a 4 yr old Worcester bosch boiler in our newly acquired house but is there any benefit at all to changing ? Obviously the cost of removing a perfectly good boiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme- but that aside can anyone tell me that stored gas is going to be much more expensive ? Thanks I <p> We moved into our property in 2005 and immediately had gas installed to the property , along with gas central heating . At that time the only boiler protection filters in place were on industrial units at the time it was not envisaged that metallic sludge from the radiators would damage the much more sensitive condensing boilers . Anyway , two boilers and numerous breakdowns later , along with numerous leaking radiators probably caused by us turning radiators off and on to save money , and a total outlay of six to seven thousand pounds , I wish that I had stayed with storage heaters and off peak electricity and am seriously thinking of going back to them as my son is an electrician and I am fed up being ripped off by the Gas Safe industry . <p> Hi . I need fair advise regarding heating system . For my whole life I use gas as a fuel for central heating and hot water and in kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has oil heating system and electricity for cooking . I can use gas bottle for cooking , but I am totally new to oil central heating . Can anyone tell me is it affordable ? Cheaper or equivalent to gas central heating ? Is it possible/advise able to change it to economy 7 electric heating ? <p> I have a large property in a very rural area so no mains gas . Its an all electric Economy 7 system but I have found it is the cheapest system Ive ever had . My total bill is -900 a year , all the heater , water and cooking , much cheaper than other properties I 've had on oil/mains gas and LPG . <p> Please can you advise me ? We have a family holiday home in Anglesey , with an oil central heating system . We are just about to put central heating into a boathouse in the grounds sto accomadate extra family and we cant agree which is going to be the most cost effective- bottled LPG Or Oil ? We know oil is cheaper but and this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas boiler is literally half the cost of an oil one to buy and install . The boathouse will only be used intermittently ie school holidays and in fact very little during the winter months at all . In the main I suspect whatever we use will mainly be for heating water . Can you advise whether , for the long term we are better to pay more upfront and install an oil fired boiler ( with the cost of an additional oil tank ) or settle for A gas boiler using the large Flogas type LPGO bottles ? If you could reply asap it would help as we are hovering on the brink of deciding ! Many thanks Neill Clark <p> I 'm converting an old studio into living accommodation bedroom , wet room and kitchen/diner/sitting room . We have no mains gas . In the main house we have oil central heating and bottle gas cooker hob . My husband and I differ on the studio heating system , my husband favours bottled gas central heating then no cold water tank needed , but I favour electricity electric radiators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can work well in some instances but we would always recommend Mains gas if you have access to it ( have you investigated whether this is possible ? ) . If not and you do opt to go the electricity route , then you have two options , the first is storage heaters which take advantage of economy 7 or infrared heating . Infrared heats area instead of volume so is an efficient way to heat with electricity . One of the great things about using electricity to heat the home as you mentioned is that you can isolate particular rooms and just heat them ( unlike a boiler for example which even if you want to heat one room still needs to fire up ) . <p> Also with electric heating you wont need to run any pipework so the install cost will be substantially cheaper . In answer to your question , I would definitely recommend electricity ahead of bottled gas central heating but whatever you decide to do , insulate the hell out of your house will doing the conversion , then it wo n't require much heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments . We come down on the side of Barry and Electric heating ( no gas areas ) for the following reasons : We have replaced both oil and LPG with economy 7 storage heaters in three/four houses over 20 years . A 4 bed detached , a 2 bed bungalow ( retired parents ) , a 5 bed detached old house and a 1990 3 bed holiday home . In all cases when the boilers failed we considered all options . In all but the holiday home we decided on night storage for the reasons outlined by Barry , no maintenance , initial outlay of system etc. in the following year of electric installation the bills against both oil and LPG were LOWER . In addition the houses were uniform ally warm all day and all evening . The houses were moderately well insulated , I the large old house we also used a log burner for cold evenings . In the holiday home we installed low voltage underfloor heating ( Step Warmfloor ) . This was expensive to install , about 5000 pounds in 2006 , but very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thermostat for each room and when empty , we set it at 6 degrees at night and 14 day to prevent freezing or damp . We moved in there for 2 years and again it was warm and economical . I note that previous bloggers are supporting their arguments by calculations , in my experience it is too difficult to control for multiple variaBles such as kW cost , usage profiles , number in home , insulation levels , maintenance , inflation , size of windows , thickness of curtains , etc. etc . My argument is based on actual experience , the same people living in the same property in the same way with the same power company over at least 3 years of oil/ LPG followed by 7 years of economy 7 or standards tariff for holiday home . So now we have bought an old tiny uninsulated bungLow , still off mains gas . We have serviced the existing 15 year old oil boiler which serves 5 radiators and will run it until it gives up . There is also a small log burner which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new technically efficient systems . For the extensions which are bigger than the existing bungalow we are considering underfloor electric heating and infrared heaters thank you Barry for your recommendations above . However not economy 7 as we found over the past four years that the increase in day rate was not balancing the decreased night rate the day rate underfloor was more economical . We will install PV panels , sorry Barry , as the 6000 pounds invested will give a better return than the banks or an expensive kitchen . So that is our experience , electricity has to be the Fuel of the future as it is supported by the direct input from sun , wind , nuclear , wave , tidal barriers , microgeneration etc. etc . As the efficiency Of the generation systems improves as it surely will , electric heating will be supported by the green establishment and governments too . <p> Steve , Biomass will definitely be worth looking at , as there are some very generous subsidies , and the cost of the fuel will be cheaper than electricity . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost , which will be high , and the upkeep required for biomass , as it is n't a fit and forget system like storage heaters . <p> After reading this entire thread I feel the need to add my typical everyday , young , working familys worth ( me , the wife and son . ) I moved into a new build semi detatched house in January 2008 so quite energy efficient . I had a vaillant pro combi boiler running 8 radiators and the on demand hot water required for showers , baths etc , I sold the property recently and now looking at properties off mains gas which is concerning me ( but like the properties ) Whatever arguements are put forward for best heating and overall costs , I owned the property for 7 years and in that time my gas bill for running the heating and hot Water never exceeded -30--40 per month ( -420 per annum average ) a boiler service -60 per annum and 1 single minor boiler repair costing -120 in total , ( minor leak . ) Never a worry of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening in winter . I would say the majority of people have many trouble free years with a gas boiler , very controllable with radiator trvs , thermostats etc and yes it does maintain or add value to a property ! The fact is energy efficiency of the properties structure will always reduce overall heating costs whichever fuel is selected this is the key , but I do n't  think an electric system will cost equal or less than a gas equivalent assuming a reputable high efficiency boiler with good warranty is installed . I 'm not commenting for arguement , its just a purely for the average person and my experience . Ground source heat pump possibly , air source heat pump average cop of 2-2.5 in UK costing more than gas , and lastly I would personally rather spend -5000 installing a good gas central heating system than-16000- -25000 for a ground source heat pump system offering similar returns in cost . In the end its all down to personal preference but cost wise I 'd be extreamly surprised to see electricity win in the next 10 years ! Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hi Stephen , Agree with your comments , my only thing to add would be for heat pumps / biomass you get paid the RHI which over the seven years can more than cover the cost of installation but everything you have said is absolutely fair ! <p> I am appalled at the picture you have chosen to use showing an LPG bulk tank . The installation is dangerous , covered and surrounded by vegetation as it is . No company would fill that tank in its current state , it also needs a good clean and re-paint . I thought at first it was an example of bad practice , but apparently not . Also bulk LPG is not a mixture of butane and propane , it is propane only . <p> UKLPG Codes of Practice say : <p> No part of the storage vessel should be located directly beneath any part of the structure of the premises or extension from it , for example roof eaves , car ports , etc. , nor beneath overhanging tree branches . Weeds , long grass , deciduous shrubs and trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area within the separation distance in column ( a ) of Table 1 ( for vessels not exceeding 1,1 tonnes LPG capacity , or within 6m ( for larger vessels ) . <p> Calor do offer a service where they bury LPG tanks for -1500 , the tank is then completely hidden from view the only thing that is visible in your garden is a green cover ( size of a drain cover ) that provides access to allow the delivery drivers to refill the tank . <p> We are not currently connected to the gas pipeline and have been quoted -7,000 by SGN to connect us . We have a small three bed property that is well insulated and is heated with oilfilled radiators . What we are keen to understand is the pay back time of intalling the gas and boiler , compared with continuing with the existing arrangement . It occurs to me that it may be some considerable time before the capital costs are covered by the revenue savings ? <p> Hi Chris , so -7,000 is certainly too much if you are just looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , research shows that having gas installed at your property can increase the value of the home . If you are on electricity only , try looking at Infrared heating panels for an efficient heating system , or even Heat Pumps . <p> I have a 2 bed semi-detached house that I rent out a typical 2 up 2 down near Canterbury , Kent It has not got gas in the area so limited on heating choices , at the moment it has a log burner running rads in the bedrooms and bathroom , couple of storage heaters 10+ yrs old and a couple of oil filled rads . I am interested in other methods of heating especially if I can get the rhi so anything I install will pay for itself and is practical and economic for my tenants what do you recommend ? <p> Hi , interesting reading all of this ! I am on oil ( no gas in the area ) my oil bill in 2014 was -9.000 ! 5 bed , + garage flat , garage as well ( to keep the motorbikes warm ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . I am thinking of getting solar panels fitted to my barn roof ( enormous ) and buying either a Bosch BPT-S5 Hybrid Solar Storage 4.4kWh to 13.2kWh or Samsung ESS residential system . Do you have any information on how much these systems cost to install or whether they will work in the UK climate ? I could go for ground source as I have a field to put it in , but the house is 1976 built and I 'm worried about the insulationor the lack of it to be precise ! Any information would be of use please , fed up with salesmen trying to sell me stuff that wo n't work in my home . Thank you . <p> Hi Ben , Try Brivis ducted heating heating , the gas ducted heating has a cheaper capital-to-cost installation and cheaper to run because these are now up to 6-star systems that can be zoned really well . <p> Hi , I am a pensioner and currently use a coal fired Rayburn for my heating and hot water and a coal fire and central heating ( from the Rayburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4-5 Ton of anthracite and 1/2 ton of ordinary coal along with a couple of ton of wood ( max ) . My coal cost is approximately -420 per ton(Anth) plus 2 bags(Ordin) . <p> I am considering going Electric but have no idea what costs I should expect , I believe I would need to change Electric Tariff also as I am on a normal supply contract for Electricity . <p> My house is 2100sq ft 3 bed Living , Kitchen and Dining Room , one bathroom and one En-suite ( Electric Shower . <p> We have an old 3 bedroomed stone built cottage . It currently has night storage heaters it is used as a holiday home . In the summer this is fine . However when we visit in the winter it is unbearably cold . One plumber has just suggested oil filled electric heaters on norm tariff instead of the economy 7 that we have now . But my husband seems to think these are inefficient and no better than the night storage we currently have . Another has suggested a wet central heating system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had been thinking of underfloor heating downstairs but then what about upstairs . Our hot water works from a heater in the bathroom upstairs . The plumber who suggested the wet heating system said that the water heater would be eating money . Any advice ? <p> I am about to build a 2 bed plus 1 bathroom extension to my house . All ground floor . I have an old 30 year old 80% efficient boiler at the orher end of the existing house , but will not be able to extend the system to the new extension . I am 80 years old and have had rheumatoid arthritis for 35 plus years , so I need an adequuate heating system . At present I am hovering bewteen airsource heating and electric floor heating , but I also have access to a 47kg propane cyclinder source , but feel that tha might be too expensive . All advice gratefully received . Obiously very helpful disvcussion here . <p> I love my poorly insulated barn conversion , but the LPG boiler flues into the chimney and is 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new gas boiler is in the downstairs cloakroom . This just about squeezes past the Listed Building Consent requirement , but it is not an ideal position . My plumber said that I would need to install 2 electric boilers and 2 fat cables if I went for a electric boiler . I also read somewhere that I would need to check with the electricity supplier that the system would be appropriate for the supply . ( a bit vague here ) I have 10 radiators on 3 floors . The previous owners just ran individual electric floor standing heaters and I am beginning to understand why they went for this option . I just can not get the information to make an informed decision . Very cold at the moment thought . <p> We had propane in a previous house coupled with eco 7 . Much cheaper to heat water and space by the eco , but the problem with night storage , even with the newer heaters is that if you open the dampers in the morning , the damn things give out minimal heat in the evenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was an electric boiler coupled to a wet system . It was a woefully inadequate 6KW . Cost a fortune to run , as needed to be working on day electricity and hardly took the chill off the house ( Well insulated , by the way ) There is eco installed . No gas here , so switched to oil . Oil is about 40p/litre now , at 10KWH/litre and boiler is 84% ( checked recently ) , so useful KWH is about 4.75p . So I do not use the eco for water heating in the winter.Summer time may be different as the boiler has to firstly heat itself before it can heat the calorifier in the tank , hence lower efficiency , so might be different in the summer . Get Barrys point about service costs , just paid -110 , but that included a new part that only needs replacing infrequently . By the way , Barry , when calculating costs for oil/gas you forgot cost of running pumps/fans etc , which helps your case for electricity ( Do n't  know where you live but here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your KWH cost ) Interesting debatekeep it going ! <p> Oil or electric wet heating system ? I am about to install a heating system in a new well insulated large 4 bed house with underfloor heating downstairs and conventional radiators upstairs . My idea is to install a 4kw solar pv system to heat a large water storage tank with a 35kw boiler kicking in when the water drops to a certain temperature . Can anyone tell me if a electric boiler at 14p pkw is cheaper to run than a oil boiler at 55p p ltr . <p> in environmental terms electric heating is a disaster unless you have a well insulated house and a heat pump . At around 15p per kwh it is also expensive if you are talking about storage heaters or electric radiatiors <p> You should get a professional advice on what your heating requirements are , either through a Green Deal Assessment , or by asking a good renewables installer to give you a quote for a heat pump as part of that process they should give you a heat loss calculation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yougen.co.uk to find a well recommended local installer to you . <p> The take the most conservative performance estimate from the installers for payback versus your current situation , then make a judgement call . <p> Using the Green Deal to pay for an installation is probably marginal if you have either cash or the chance of a low interest loan / mortgage extension use that instead <p> What if I live in a house where the gas is pumped through an Independent Gas Transporter ( IGT ) and not directly from transco . They seem to charge a fortune . I live in a very small home on my own and in the winter months it is swallowing more then the Electric . About -3 a day which for one single person in such a small home is really high . I thought about the cost of converting to electric . <p> Ok here 's my thoughts , not sure how I got here as I was reading up about triple glazing , but stopped for a quick read and some very thought provoking posts . Ive been in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercially and domestic . Eventually setting up my own business 20 years ago , now I 'm not going to argue either for gas or electric heating I 'm not even going to produce a running costs argument as there are so many facts and figures to take into consideration it is virtually impossible to arrive at a concrete figure which applies to everyone . As an example to heat a 3 bed modern semi in London is going to be cheaper to heat than a 3 bed thatched cottage on Dartmoor , how much hot water is consumed in a day is another . My house is empty all day as we are out at work , so our heating is on for no more than 2 hours in the evening . The point I am trying to make is , is that everyones demands and requirements are different . I do n't  even think we have an average family now as people come and go , work odd hours , even work from home which of course is going to put up your heating costs . Having said all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric heating installation company , being 100% honest with you it was the best thing I ever did . On average I fit one gas boiler to eight electric boilers , from originally covering just Central London I now cover over 6 countys . I 've also had to take on additional installers and office staff . I do make random enquiries with clients to check that they are happy with the work and also to check with their running costs , the customers that convert from gas to electric tend to average out having to pay an additional -150--200 pa those where we install thermal storage units the additional costs are negligible depending on which off-peak tariff they are on . The one guarantee I give all my customers who have an electric boiler installed , is that they will never have an issue with carbon monoxide .. By writing this I am not suggesting either electric is better over gas , electric is n't suitable for everyone but then again neither is a ground source heat pump if your over 65 or you intend moving home every 5 years or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures about prices of gas and electric and how much each one cost to run and service for me its just a load of rubbish , I go for electric any time from my experience with my gas water heater going bust day before Good Friday and again two weeks before selling my house talk about Sods law I would rather pay higher electric prices than expensive boiler repairs anytime <p> We 've just bought a 3 bed cottage . Part is an extension . Solid , very thick walls . We 've got a multifuel stove in the living room and some old , inefficient storage heaters . <p> Its freezing so we were planning to get central heating put in but were off grid for mains gas . Have been considering all other options . Love the idea of using renewable sources but think air source/ground source would n't be suitable due to age of property . <p> Considering a wet system with a biomass boiler , LPG versus a modern electric system ( probably dry ) . The two electric options would be infrared or http : **28;244;TOOLONG . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good ( hot and cheap to run ) . <p> Are you able to give any advice in terms of which would be cheaper long-term including the massive set-up costs of a wet system ? We both work and so are out most days until late so actually feel like perhaps the electric dry system would work out cheaper long-term due to long installation and low maintenance costs . We could then invest in solar panels too . <p> Do you have any experience of the infrared heaters and how warm they make the house feel ? <p> Also , if we go with an electric system what is the most environmentally friendly and cost-effective type of boiler to go for ? And would solar thermal be an option with one of the governments green deals ? <p> Many thanks for your advice and for making such a comprehensive website ! <p> Having read all the posts I agree with Barry and Barry F that if you take all the associated costs into account then electricity is a viable cost effective alternative to gas . It also give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues or worries and that is priceless , no stress , no workmen in your home for repairs and no days without heat throughout every room in the house . <p> I have not read all the posts but Barry has some very valid points . No one seems to compare the installation and running costs which are a lot higher for gas/oil lpg etc . Also with oil and lpg you have to have to have tanks and associated cost . Also if you are renting out property you have additional safety certificate costs.etc Safety is also an issue with electricity having no combustion problems . You also have more options for siting boilers/heaters etc ; with electricity . A well insulated property with modern controls etc ; should be able to use electricity as a viable alternative to other systems . <p> Barry F a load of rubbish RE : running costs and install . I am both a plumber and a qualified electrician . By the time you factor in the size of radiators , types , thermostatic controls , the costs quickly rack up . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiators . Most gas boilers have a lifespan beyond 15 years with little maintenance thereafter if installed by someone who knows what they are doing . My brother had electric radiators fitted in one of his rental flats and two of them have already broken down , not to mention the fiddly electronic controls that come with them , that is impossible for the average punter to get their head round . Electricity prices since I last checked are 3 times that of gas just look at 99% of tariffs that are currently advertised on uSwitch . <p> Hi I live in a two bed flat and have gas central heating and I am paying -94 or a year as a standing charge whether I use the gas or not . Would it be cheaper in the long run to have my gas capped and just buy a couple of calor gas fires as I only use the gas maybe three to four months a year . Mike <p> Hi Mike having jus read your post I think its the case that nearly all leasehold flats in England and Wales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tower blocks it is normally a criminal offense to take gas bottles into the building . Sorry if this is not good news but I think you would need to check thev situation for you building before making your decision . <p> Being in a similar situation in the past I found a couple of dynamic ( fan ) storage heaters and some extra insulation was a very cost effective and comfortable solution . <p> I SAVED 200 POUNDS and my friends too ! ! I switched my Propane and electricity BILL with First Utility . They give you a quote in less than 2minutes and if you choose to go with them , they will do the transfer for you and u do n't  have to cancell anything and it wont cost you anything I saved money and my friends also ! ! I 'm glad that i can help some of you guyz ! ! I really recommand this company to anyone ! ! <p> Are n't  there are other factors to take into consideration like installation costs , annual servicing and maintenance ? A new condenser boiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very reliable and have an average life span of only about 7 years before they have to be ripped out and replaced . An annual boiler service costs over -70 . Repair costs are astronomical requiring you take out an additional -250 a year for comprehensive breakdown cover . And how does a new gas installation that requires new radiators and extensive plumbing compare to electric ? Finally , if you have electric you can take advantage of Economy 7 night time tarrif which brings the KwH cost much more in line with gas . Clearly , there are are many more considerations when you 're doing the sums . <p> Sam , 7 Years is definitely not the average lifetime of a boiler. 12 years is the guide we use , and having done thousands of surveys I can say that ripping a boiler out after 7 years is very unusual . Some boilers like the Baxi Platinum now come with 10 year warranty these days too . Which negates the need for your -250 breakdown cover too at least for 10 years . <p> -5,000 is about right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to put a new boiler in 10 years down the line , it will not need new rads and the cost is going to be closer to -1,600 . <p> Economy 7 does make things cheaper , but most tariff start with a night rate of 7p or so , compared to 3.5 to 4p for gas . Plus you are going to be paying much more ( 16-20p/kWh ) for your daytime electricity as well any additional heating , tv , washing machine , cooking etc etc . Unless you are incredibly careful , or a night owl , it really does n't  compare to gas . <p> Like DR J , we are renovating a holiday cottage . It has a 4mx6m living room and one 4+3.5m bedroom . Kitchen and bathroom are approx 3m x 2m . We currently have economy 7 night storage heaters and an electric emersion heater for hot water . We do not like the current bulky heaters and want a heating system that can give heat quickly if required and is not on if the room is warm during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the property is mainly occupied in the warmer months and in winter mainly by us . We will also be installing a wood burning stove . <p> Can anyone recommend an electric boiler and what is the best way of heating the rooms underfloor may not be an option . <p> Hi Michael , I would just point out that if your storage heaters are on in the summer and you do n't  want them to be , you can turn them off ! Even older storage heaters can be turned off so they do n't  charge overnight . <p> The problem with an electric boiler is that you will be heating your house on the expensive day rate electricity , so whilst you will have a bit more control over the exact temperature of the house , expect your bills to skyrocket , even if you switch over to a single rate tariff . <p> Heat pumps may be a better option if the home is well insulated , or modern slimline quantum storage heaters that enable better control of temperature . I would not touch an electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge kettle all day . You will be paying a fortune . <p> Barry , we are doing renovation at the moment and are seriously considering going all electric . Out of interest with your setup do you have a storage tank for the water or is the electric bioler on-demand ? <p> Also in your opinion is is worth going solar ( pv ) to assist with the electricity usage ? <p> Hello Dr J. sorry for the long delay replying havent read this site since August . <p> We do n't  have an electric boiler I would n't entertain the idea . We have electric underfloor heating . So for our hot water , we have a hot water cylinder with an immersion heater . But ours is a mains-pressure one . It costs us -219 a year 60p a day in daytime electric , and we get four daily showers from it . <p> I would n't touch solar PV either . The mathematics are false . No account of lost interest is taken into account ( you had -6000 sitting in an account which you have just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and there is no mention of the -1,000 inverter you 'll need in 10 years , so again that 's -100 a year you have to knock off your income . So that 's -250 off the income figures before you even start to talk about maintenance , repairs , and the reduction in your house value . <p> Hi Barry , The mathematics of solar are n't  false ! 500,000 have solar pV on the their roof so it would be strange that some many people went ahead with it if that was the case ! If you install solar PV , we recommend going for micro inverters , these last longer than the inverter you are talking about above and also increase kWh produced ( if there is any type of shading on the solar system ) . <p> The Feed-in tariff gets paid over 20 years so if you can get a 3kW system on you roof and produce 2,500kWh you will get paid -470 a year based on the export tariff and generation tariff ( all tax free ) . This does not include any energy savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use all 2,500kWh even if you have a solar diverter installed , but still you should be able to use 80% + . Combine the savings and the income and you get over -700 a year paid over 20 years , the income is tax free and that does n't  take into account the rising costs of electricity ! <p> Hi James 500,000 have got it because of the incentives given by the government . This is paid for by the rest of us in taxes and in my case because I am all electric by the charges added to electricity bills which is far higher than other fuels . <p> Hello James . 2,000,000 people read the Sun every day , it does n't  make it the best newspaper . A return on investment has to be within a reasonable time period . In my opinion , the return ( if you ever get one at all ) is far too long . I 've seen ads stating a return of 7 years , which is just absurd . Micro inverters , as I understand them , mean an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexity ( due to the number of them ) , and therefore add an unreliability &amp; repair cost factor . <p> Now , your 3kWp system : Figures from solar energy companies just can not be trusted . Its like asking a car salesman how much mpg you 'd get from the car he wants to sell you . So I just went to the Energy Savings Trust website and added some typical figures into their solar calculator . 40 degree roof angle Facing south Slight shading -35 a month electricity bill 2,102 kWh generated Capital cost -6,430 Total earned over life of system -5,255 ( therefore -210 per year ) <p> Remember , this is the Energy Savings Trust a PRO-renewable organisation . The figures you give are for ideal conditions , which simply are n't  typical , and take no account of degradation of the panels a 20% decline . And here 's the punchlinethe Energy Savings Trust take NO ACCOUNT of maintenance charges , like replacement of the inverter at -100 a year , nor do they take any account of loss of interest on the capital invested ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -5,255 Inverter every 10 years -2,500 Loss of interest on capital -4,019 ( 2.5% per annum ) COST of project therefore -6,519 ( not savings , not profit , COST ) <p> In perfect conditions , solar panels might return you some money after many , many years . In typical conditions they wo n't . If you do n't  like that , then take it up with the Energy Savings Trust . <p> I have just tried to replicate your findings in the EST solar too . In fact I tried to make the results worse ( more shading ) and came out with only 2084kwh using my postcode . <p> It gave an annual income of -419 although this did include money saved on bill of -69 . So not sure how your figures were so low ? <p> There are a few points though . 2084kWh even at your 9p/kWh electricity cost is a -187 annual energy saving . This is obviously if you use all the electricity which is unlikely , but there are tools out there that help you use 85% + . Also the microinverters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole system but the key here is since they are not exposed to as high power and heat loads as central inverter , they also tend to last significantly longer , and in fact many come with a 25 year warranty . <p> Finally your last link to free solar is obviously different because the feed-in tariff is being paid to the installers ! They own your roof ! <p> Barry , The figures do n't  take into account the rising cost of electricity either do n't  tell me the per kwh cost in 10 years is not going to be more than what you are paying at the moment . Theyve more than doubles in the last 10 years If you are paying 9p/kWh , good for you . I cant get less than 12.5p myself . It does depend on your postcode somewhat as well . <p> Alan , do you REALLY think that electricity prices will rise in the way they have in the past decade ? They are right on the edge of being politically unstable being that they would be a major political issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  rule out $60 per barrel . Gas prices will fall in the next decade . Coal is abundant and cheap . We are also on the edge of new discoveries in renewables with graphene . Nuclear fusion may only be 10 years away . All of these will make future energy prices either the same as they are now , or possibly even lower . All we have to do is shake off the insane idea that we can effect climate , then coal can be used again and its cheap ! So yes , I am telling you that electricity is not going to be more in 10 years ( except for inflationary pressures so your -500 electricity bill will be -672 in 10 years ) . <p> I am currently interested in comparing the price of heating hot water by economy 7 electric compared to heating with gas particularly for bathrooms . We have a bathroom that is very remote from the boiler and I worry that particularly in the summer I am wasting great amounts of heat with hot water going from the boiler to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very difficult . <p> I was therefore thinking that having a new electric cylinder with an economy 7 immersion heater located in the bathroom , which means that pipe runs would be very short , would be a good way to go . I could then change the gas boiler to a combi to heat up water for the kitchen and downstairs loo on the rare occasions that is is required . <p> What do people think ? has anybody else swapped just water heating from gas to electric and how did it work out ? <p> Hi Graeme , This is an interesting question . My feeling would be that the money you are losing via the lack of pipe lagging is n't actually as high as you think . Water has a high specific heat capacity , and therefore wo n't lose much heat travelling from the boiler to the cylinder . Assuming your cylinder is very well insulated , I would be surprised if economy 7 is cheaper to run . You must consider that even at night , the best economy 7 tariffs are around 6.5p/kWh , whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiler is reasonably efficient ( 80% or more ) , it would take some serious loss of heat via lagging to make those 2 values level out . The most important factor though is that if you use economy 7 , you are going to be paying more for all your daytime appliances . You will be paying 16p+/kWh to watch TV , light your rooms , run the fridge etc .. Our golden rule is that unless you will use more than 40% of your electricity at night , economy 7 is always more expensive . Most people use 20% or so at night , so chances are , even if you immersion works out a fraction cheaper , everything else is going to more than cancel it out <p> Do n't  rush into switching your system , you will be in for a surprise , and not in a good way ! <p> Very interesting reading as we have electric storage heaters on economy 7 at a cost of 4.2 p day and 15p night . As we use 65% at night ( I put my washer on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooker that has a gas hob and now that often have imposed a standing charge our gas bill will increase by -80 as a low user we only use approx -15 per year gas . We are now wondering whether to change to gas heating or get an all electric cooker and do away with gas . Like Barry I do prefer electric it is clean and maintainable free and as my husband is an electrician an obvious choice . Our yearly bill is -1100 per annum and as we are retired at home in a warm home a 3 bedroom semi . After reading all the pros and cons I think we will stay as we are the cost of changing can not be recouped . <p> Hi- loved reading all the articles about gas versus electricity . We live in a rural area and have lpg gas which can be very expensive . We have replaced the boiler and installed a drayton thermostat to adjust the temperature during the day . Added extra loft insulation and double glazed the windows . We use the electric immersion as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 500 watt to 1000 watt panel heaters in some of the rooms to take the chill out of the room rather than turning the radiators on.We also installed a 5.2 kv solar panel system and changed electricity suppliers to a cheaper deal from 16p to 10.18 . Our lpg gas was 68p a litre but we currently pay 44.10 though this will start to go up . Basically we are trying to find the right balance as lpg was our biggest outlay and we reckoned that by using electricity a bit more it could be the lesser of 2 evils . So far we are ordering gas less frequently and the electricity bill is down but appreciate that this could change soon as the solar panels will produce less and it will start to get colder . <p> This is a very useful article thank you . I am not sure I agree with some of the comments above though , mainly because mains gas is far cheaper than electricity , but I do appreciate Barrys comments re : lower maintenance costs . <p> James Crow . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the authors of this article are going wrong too ! <p> Look , imagine you wanted a new car . Now , running your car on electric rather than petrol is far cheaper . BUT , an electric car is more expensive to produce . So it is n't about the fuel cost when it comes to a car as electric is much cheaper than petrol its about how the car uses that fuel , and the severe costs of a new battery-pack in later years . This is what has stopped the idea of mainstream electric cars . <p> I say again , and then I 'm bowing out , look at the cost of the whole thing , not just the fuel . My electric heating has no maintenance , no servicing , and is guaranteed for 15 years so there are zero costs . I do n't  need to go over again how much a gas-based heating system costs . You can not just say , Oh , gas is cheaper than electric . That is too simplistic . <p> Interesting comments here by Barry . So in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as the UK , but incomes about 7 times lower . In general I think in the EU electricity is expensive and may in the UK you are luck it is so cheap . However I think there is a trend for more people to be moving to gas or district heating . In my town more and more people are getting connected to gas and seems to be the way europeans are heading . But never less good support for electricity , even though I would n't use it for heating personally . <p> I have just come across this topic while searching for heating solutions for a house needing renovation . <p> I am trying to compare how much the cost could be for a complete heating and hot water system as there is no gas supply in this area and the house does n't  currently have any heating other than open fires and a rayburn . <p> I was considering the option of solar panels and installing electric heaters and under floor heating as opposed to paying out for an oil tank , boiler and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat pump could cost the same as solar panels and only provide heating , whereas , the solar panels should provide the majority of the electric in the home including running the electric heaters or in our climate would that not produce enough electric for this purpose ? <p> Tracey . In my home I used Warmup Foil underfloor heating coupled to simple room/air thermostats . It has been superb . I initially made the mistake ( on the first room I did ) to fit an all-singing , all-dancing clever air thermostat . This proved a nightmare to comprehend , and it had its own learning system that started to override the settings ( it is supposed to do that ) . So I removed it , and as I have fitted the heating to every room I have fitted standard thermostats . During the Winter we keep the heating on permanently ( on set-back ) which may make our electric heating figures even more astounding ! <p> As for a standard electric heating system , then I would recommend the Dimplex 3072 2kW convector heater . They cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs can be removed so that it fits to the wall . Do n't  buy any panel heater more expensive , as underneath they are almost all the same . For your hot water , I would recommend either a standard immersion heater cylinder , or a mains-pressure type , like an Albion Mainsflow Contractor Electric . Your plumber would have trouble tracking one down , as the Albion list of cylinders is complex . In either case , fit a timer to the immersion so that it only heats for set periods . <p> As for solar panels , you would need a massive array to provide your complete home need , and for my money , the payback period is way too long anyway , but that 's another argument entirely ! <p> Thanks Barry I 'm going electric everything you say backs up my own research . In the event of a power failure in rural Wales I have an LPG gas fire and with an immersion heater and a tank full of hot water I think I 'm going to be all set for winter . <p> Thanks you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get this information out to the general public ? <p> I did n't  pick the gas price it is uswitchs typical gas price as of November 2013 I just Googled average gas price . I did choose the cheapest electric price obviously ( ! ) as it is for my home which was my point . Why would someone ( wanting to heat their home with electric ) choose anything more than the cheapest price they could get , James ? ? ? <p> So I just re-did the figures above with your gas price of 4.21pthe calculation comes out at just -125 less than the 5p I quoted . Hardly much of a " huge impact " , is it James , and has n't  swung it back into gass favour , I think ! <p> Hi Barry , I was simply demonstrating that the values you selected obviously showed electricity in a more positive light . For example you have now used the AVERAGE price of gas , and there is now a greater argument for gas imagine , if you used the cheapest gas available , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would n't ! The spectrum band on gas is tight . Let 's say the cheapest gas price you might get is 4p . The spectrum band on electric is wide from 9.5p cheapest to double figures . The difference is therefore negligible . I have already shown you that reducing gas from 5p to 4.21 makes a difference of only -125 to the figures , mate ! And please stop twisting the debate : I have used the average price of gas all along . I pointed out that uswitch say it is 5p . Please re-read my posts for confirmation . Please retract that I have suddenly started using the AVERAGE gas price . Just because you get yours from DECC and I Google it to get it from uswitch does n't  make either of us correct , necessarily , as both are out of date by 9-10 months . I have been very careful to show my sources throughout our discussion . They are industry , government , and trade data only MY figures on MY system are my own . <p> Gill . Go to uswitch site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred supplier Where there is a small question mark under your proposed savings , there will be your annual personal projection of costs Click on it Now click on show calculations Now click on show calculations under your new proposed supplier Under electricity unit rates and calculations it will show you your use in kWh and how much you 'll be charged in pence per kWh . Mine is 9.11p per kWh . <p> Uswitch is n't as easy to use as it looks , you have to look on the site for the right places to click . You can shortcut by just going direct to extraenergys website . But there are others , like OVO , who also charge 11p per kWh . <p> Unfortunately , your article makes a number of mistakes , and fails to give the bigger picture . By my own experience ( and I am a gas heating engineer by qualification and trade ) for the average home , electric is only marginally more expensive than gas in the region of perhaps -100 a year more . First of all , let me explain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . I did this purely for simplicity ( and I hate radiators ) . Your principle mistake is failing to take the considerable costs of gas heating maintenance into account . Insurance and/or servicing and repairs is going to add some -175 to your annual bill . Secondly , you also fail to recognise depreciation . Boilers have to be replaced on average every 10 years ( according to Defra and experience ! ) . That depreciation is a whopping -250 a year . You can not just take the fuel costs alone when considering actual annual costs of electric against gas . Strangely , you also quote a figure of 15p per kWh for electric . I 've no idea where you got that I currently pay just under 11p ! ( Aug 2014 ) . In fact , I actually pay 9.5p but there is a standing charge which effectively takes it to just under 11p . I run a 3-bed detached home for an annual fuel bill of -1740 all electric . We have four showers a day and keep the heating ( underfloor foil type ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm homewith no boiler , no fumes , no pipes , no radiators , no servicing , and no breakdowns . It is simplicity itself to use which is what I wanted most of all . <p> The time of gas central heating has been and gone . It is old fashioned , unreliable , troublesome , and outdated . Electric is convenient , reliable , and great to use . I 'm afraid your article does nothing to dispel the myths that still surround the electric Vs gas debate , and is inaccurate as usual . Its a great shame that some people fail to do actual research , and merely trot out the same stuff , whilst not giving the full picture . <p> Hi scruffy , i am installer of infrared in north west Scotland and I have done now well over 50 installs of these things , mainly in holiday homes or barns and cottages . They are very good if they are sized correctly , but be careful there are so many companies out there that are making false claims selling rubbish pieces of kit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind the best . I encourage customers to upsize their heating requirements more often than none , so they do n't  get disappointed . There are a few companies out there that you can get the Herschels for a good price . I use Ecostore which I understand advertises somewhere on this site or Infrared4homes . I would encourage you to read more information , there is quite a lot of content on this technology on this website that is how I found about the technology in the first place . Hope this is of use , <p> Hi great site this has anyone ever heard of supergreen uk providing infra red boilers ? ? ? ? was going to have an air source heat pump fitted but the figures of the RHI are misleading . We have no mains gas and i do not want to go back to oil . Many thanks Richard <p> Hello Barry , you are probably a much younger man than I am , and you have some absolutely splendid and vociferous arguments , but I am going to stop your there with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central heating has been and gone . It is old fashioned , unreliable , troublesome , and outdated . Electric is convenient , reliable , and great to use . " You are probably too young to remember Harold Wilsons technological revolution or even in the late 70s when we thought nuclear and storage heaters was the way the go . The latter an event I genuinely thought was a game changer . So I am afraid to be a bit of a disappointment ( multiple OPEC crisis later ) to this rather colour argument taking place here but I predict gas is n't going anywhere soon . Fossil fuel costs plummeting , new gas reserves flooding the financial markets will make this a cheaper fuel source at least in the medium term . As a final point , I have an Ideal Mexico , never breaks down , super little boiler . Never had a leak or any major faults think I will stick to my gas boiler thank you very much . Good day sir . <p> I am 81 years old and have to agree with Harold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice and expertise . My family business used to provide supplies to British Tabulating Machines , one of the pioneering computer manufacturers in Britain and therefore we have always grown with computers in our family , which is why I am one of the lucky few that is computer literate of my generation . In response to the arguments presented in this blog , while computer science has moved at a rate of knots , we are no closer to ditching fossil fuels , especially gas to power heating in homes and businesses . I went to a lecture at the UCL recently and one of the visiting research fellows in fact showed research to suggest there are reserves to last us another 750 years . I too had a boiler that lasted me 25 years and only recently switched to a combination boiler because I hated the fact I had the cold water tank in the loft . In conclusion , while electricity heating is a novel idea and probably more appropriate to a country like France , I do n't  think the good British public is about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks for your comment . So I think there are a few inaccuracies , firstly a boiler service is not -175 ! That is quite a high price ! I would also dispute that you need to replace a boiler every 10 years we go into 1000s of properties a month and we see boilers that are 20 years + running quite happily ( albeit inefficiently ! ) , so I think the -250 depreciation price is quite toppy too ! <p> I would also be very interested in you energy supplier at 9.5p / kWh of electricity , since I am keen to move to them ! ! <p> I do appreciate that electricity has a place in some homes , as you say there is far less that can go wrong , and if you go the heat pump route ( provided installed on a well insulated property ) then you are looking at efficiencys of 300% plus far higher than conventional electric heating , but for many ( and I would go as far as saying the majority ! ) , gas still makes sense for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  agree entirely with barrys comment he raises one vital point and that is just quoting the kwh price does n't  prove that all electric heating systems are expensive to run for example your gas / Oil boiler may be rated at 30kw and your electric boiler may be rated at 9kw so if they both run for an hour the mains gas boiler would cost -1.20 the lpg boiler would cost -2.25 the oil boiler would cost -1.80 the electric boiler would cost -1.35 , so based on that mains gas is cheaper based on those figures but electric is better that lpg or oil . but it is far more complicated than that , are you using a thermal store ? do you have solar pv ? do you have solar thermal ? because the combination of one or all of these things could make electric cheaper than mains gas . <p> Reckon it depends on the boiler . We did about 10 years almost trouble free with our combi gas boiler , then had to replace at about 12 years . The plumber noting our disappointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after about 10 years . Gone are the days of the everlasting boiler that chugs away albeit un economically for 20-30 years . Replacement boiler plus power flush ugh ( 12 year old rads and pipes ) , massive job , loads of gunk and expensive even with hubby acting as the plumbers mate . Next property no amount of power flushing could have saved the pipes and rads , It said it was fernoxed but it was still so furred up it could n't get hot . The bills paid by the previous owner to keep an increasingly failing system going would have brought the average householder to tears . Hundreds of pounds paid to get tepid rads and water . I was paying -57 per month to take the chill off the place and be unable to have a hot bath . Only you do n't  know what its costing til the bill comes in . Electricity is easy to cost and only one standing charge . Easy to use , controllable etc . Great if you are a bit of a girl and do n't  know one end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the -175 is for an annual insurance on the boiler and system . If you do n't  have insurance then you could lay yourself open to bills far higher than that ! In my career , I 've had people cry in my presence ( no kidding ) when I have had to tell them the repair costs to their heating ( not my repair costs , I hasten to add , but what a typical heating engineer might charge to get their system going again ) . <p> Yes , there are boilers way older than 10 years , I recently saw one that was installed in the early 1960s . But they are rare , James . The 10 years I quoted comes direct from Defra , not me , so take it up with them . But by experience I can tell you that they are correct . A Scottish Government website states 8-10 years ! LONG ... <p> A colleague of mine recently removed one after just seven years , due to a busted condensing heat exchanger ( amongst other things wrong with it ) . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toppy would be wrong . <p> My electrical supplier is extraenergy . My last supplier was OVO again , 11p per kWh. , and ScottishPower also charge 11p . Who , with an electric heating system , would pay your 15p per kWh when ( at the very least ) three companies will charge you 11p ? <p> We must disagree , the only reason that people do n't  go for electric is ignorance . No one tells them that , in fact , electric heating is NOT far more than gas . Indeed , it can even be cheaper when ALL factors are taken into account . People , like yourself , just look at the fuel costs in isolation . You can not do that . Buying a gas heating system can be like buying a car that does 100 miles to the gallon , whilst ignoring that it will cost you twice the purchase price of another car that will do 50 miles to the gallon . <p> Gas heating just does n't  have the controllability of electric heating , so it is inefficient in that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lots of people install condensing boilers thinking that it will save them a fortune it wo n't . Condensing boilers only condense when the return temperature is less than 55 degrees C. Many people do n't  even know that some boilers NEVER condense ! With electric heating you can have individual time and temperature control of EACH ROOM . It is possible to do this with a gas boiler system , but costs an enormous amount more , and is prone to failure ( due to the components installed to necessitate full control ) . So again , electric scores over gas in controllability allowing efficiency . <p> I say again , the ONLY reason electric systems have n't yet taken off is ignorance . A heating engineer is n't going to tell a prospective client about it because the profit is in labour and materials associated with installing a -4000 gas based radiator system . Using time &amp; temperature controlled electric panel heaters , its possible to have an electric heating system for just -300 ! But no heating engineer is going to tell you thatexcept this one . <p> Hi there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 bedroomed terraced house , however I have recently seen these ceramic electric radiators being advertised which seem to suggest that they continue to heat your property even after the heater has been switched off . One of the heaters I am looking at is EEPC recently shown on Ideal world shopping channel . May I ask for your advice as I will soon have to make a decision on which way I go . <p> If you were to install a boiler today , you should get a 7-year warranty " that includes parts and labour . That boiler should cost in the realm of -2,500 as you say and I also agree about the boiler yearly servicing costs . <p> Now the average bill in the home is -1352 per year " with 70% going towards heating and the remainder towards electricity . <p> If you take the heating bill part of this ( approx. -950 ) with an 80% efficient gas boiler and a unit of gas is 4p / kWh " it would suggest using 23650kWh of gas . <p> If you used an electric heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of electricity " which indeed is less in pure numbers terms , but at 11p/kWh it would actually cost in excess of -2,000 per year . <p> As a result , you would save significantly each year using gas . Even if you had to install a brand new heating system ( at -4,500 ) " it would still pay back and make more sense to go for gas . <p> Hello James . Your 7-year warranty is a little selective . Glow-worm ( for example ) have a 3-year warranty on the Easicom , a 5-year warranty on the Ultimate , and a mere 2-year warranty on all their other boilers . And anyway , James , that 's on a boiler , not the system . <p> Let me give you my own figures : <p> To be precise , my annual bill is -1759 -422 of that is lighting &amp; cooking This leaves -1337 for my heating &amp; hot water using 12160 kWh @11p/kWh not your 18920 kWh . I would say my home is average being a 3-bed detached with typical insulation . Now , if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 12160 kW . Indeed , I reckon 30% more . This accounts for a 80% efficiency boiler , but ALSO accounts for losses of efficiency in over-heated rooms ( due to the lack of control against a time &amp; temperature-controlled electric system ) . This means I would require 15796 kWh of gas . Uswitch give a typical gas price of 5p per kWh ( Nov 2013 ) This means a heating cost ( under gas ) of -790 ( 15796 X 5p ) I accept your warranty on boilers , but a system insurance policy will cost , say -16 a month ( source : Calorserve 3 , Care Plan Plus , Prestige Silver Care ) , that 's -192 IN ADDITION to the gas fuel cost of -790 = -982 But were not done . Despite the insurance , there are things they do n't  cover , AND they have caps on claims , AND they limit the number of yearly call-outs . So every once in a while you will still have to pay out despite your insurance . Let 's pick an arbitrary figure of -100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year for gas . But were still not done . Let 's not forget that boiler depreciation . You would need to save -250 a year to replace it . So now we have -1332 a year for gas . Remember , my electric heating &amp; hot water bill is -1337 . <p> So James , I say that that you would n't save on going for gas . But there 's more of course . With an electric system , you wo n't get the breakdowns , you wo n't get the risks , you wo n't get the horrible steel radiators , you wo n't get the lack of control . With electric , If one room fails , you still have heating everywhere else . Its quiet , 100% efficient , and TOTALLY time &amp; temperature controllable . Despite my professional gas background and qualifications ( and it has given me a good career ) , I would never touch gas again . Let 's be generous to you ( as I too have been selective ) and say that a gas system might work out a couple of hundred pounds cheaper a year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of hundred pounds . Its far better than a conventional gas heating system in so many ways . But as I have shown , even the economics of gas ( which would give it an advantage ) can be shown to be false . <p> We will have to disagree , but all I can assure you of are my own experiences at the sharp end of heating systems , day in and day out , and my own electric heating system and its costs . My annual electric heating bill of -1337 gives me a delightful system that is warm , silent , and so easy to control . During the Winter it comes on and off all night , keeping the floors warm , and a pleasure to walk on . Even if it were twice the price of a horrid gas heating system , it would still be worth it ! But as I have shown , it is n't . <p> Hi Barry , I can see you are a big believer in electricity ! ! As a final point from me , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per DECCs domestic energy price statistics from December 2013 where gas is 4.21p/kWh and electricity is 13.52p/kWh . This has huge impacts on the figures you have quoted above and in fact swings it well into gass favour . Now I know you can obviously find cheaper electricity and gas than this , but it does show some flaws in the logic above you have picked the cheapest electricity and the most expensive gas ! I honestly do believe electricity is n't a bad alternative but perhaps it is n't quite as good as you are making out ! ! <p> I 've just moved from a new build house on mains gas to a 6 yr old property running a 2008 Worcester Bosch Heatslave 18/25 oil combi boiler.The cost of running this boiler is -1.70 per hour . ( uses 2.75litres phr at 65p per litre . ) . So 5hrs per day in winter and 2 hrs a day in summer ( for hot water there is no storage tank ) results in a bill of -1903 for heating and hot water in a house with an EPC rating of 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar sized property with the same EPC . When I tried to switch to an air source heat pump and borrow the money from a Greendeal Provider I was deemed ineligible by the Greendeal Assessor because the numbers ( from the computer programme ! ) said I would be -213 per year better off staying with oil . I was so disgusted with the whole fiasco I complained to QUIDOS ( who oversee the scheme ) who also thought this was inaccurate . The Greendeal Assessor was dismissive and refused to query the result so a formal complaint was the only option . The result is a refund of the Assessors -150 fee but I 'm still stuck with an oil bill iro -2000 pa. ( because they still insist the numbers are correct ! ) and for a household with only one person this seems ludicrous Im going to disconnect the oil and install a modern electric immersion heater/cylinder for the hot water ( which will last me 2 days ) and pray the Government wake up to the energy crisis and work out an affordable method of heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way anyone considering a switch might try talking to the Greendeal helpline do n't  waste your time it is staffed with young poorly trained girls who sadly , have n't a clue and cant get you off the phone quick enough -expect to go round in circles what a shambles . <p> Hi Karen , Sorry to hear you have had a bad time with your assessment . Unfortunately the finance is based on the EPC , and there are lots of limitations to the software . Even if you did have decent savings from switching to a heat pump , it is highly unlikely you would have gotten full finance towards the cost of a switch you may have received a few thousand with the rest to be paid up front yourself . <p> Heat pumps are expensive and although the RHI will make them worthwhile in the long run , you will need the initial capital to make it happen Green Deal or not . <p> Hi Alan yes Heat pumps are expensive -9600 in my case and I 'm not convinced this is the most cost effective solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my findings and is in the business of providing heating . His honesty is refreshing and I 'm bowled over with his clarity and openness . <p> I 'm glad you are in the discussion can you join with me to find a real solution to the costs of heating a home ? we are not always fed the correct information by the Government they have targets to meet in terms of carbon emissions . Their motivation is to avoid EU penalties . The rest of us are mostly motivated by the need to decrease financial burdens . Being green too well that would be a bonus we would all like to contribute to that .. = <p> Very good article . Some additional considerations with heatpumps , both ground source and air source , is the flow temperature of the distribution system ; at a minimum you must use low temp radiators circa 55 degrees or the best solution is to use underfloor heating circa 45 degrees . If you design the UFH for heatpumps you can go as low as 35 degrees . The rooms are all still heated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( seasonal ) COP to between 4 and 5 . Also the way you heat a house with heatpumps is quite different , best results come from operating the heating 24/7 , trickling heat in all the time . This is the main reason that heatpumps only work on properties that are extremely well insulated . If you use solar recharge , pumping spare solar heat down you ground source collector in the summer , you can possibly double you COP . All this means that heat pumps work well on new build but are difficult to retro fit . <p> Hi Rita , Thanks for your comment . A litre of LPG equates to around 7kWh of energy , so that means you are paying around 7-8p a kWh for your lpg . Of course , your lpg boiler will not be 100% efficient , but it will work out significantly cheaper than an electric boiler , at 15p/kWh . You could look at combining an electric system with solar PV and/or solar thermal , which would mean you would use far less mains electricity , but for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . <p> Hi , I 'm interested in your comments about combining an electric system with solar panels . I 'm renovating a bungalow from to to bottom and looking at options for hot water and heating . It is a rural area so mains gas is not an option . I would prefer not to go back on oil due to cost and LPG for same reason . The roof is perfect for panels so wondering if this is my best option . Any thoughts ? Thanks <p> Hi Ian , Thanks for your comment . The good news is that there are so many more options for off grid properties than there used to be . Youve got heat pumps , biomass , solar thermal , infrared just to name a few . <p> It depends a little on how much space you have and your budget . For around 4k you could install a solar thermal system to preheat your hot water , but you would still need something to get it up to a usable temperature in your central heating system . Solar thermal is a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it pays back quickly . <p> For solar pv to help heat your home , it is going to have to be a pretty large system , as in the winter you will only be generating 20% or so of what you would in the summer . Still , using efficient electric heating like infrared could help keep the bills down while using your solar pv . <p> If the home is well insulated a heat pump would be a great option , but only for more modern or well retrofitted properties . This too can be augmented by solar thermal / pv . <p> If you take a look around our site , there is lots more info on these different technologys nd their advantages and disadvantages . <p> Thanks . Its a 3 bed bungalow with 2 beds in the loft . I 'm looking at good insulation throughout as part of the renovation . I 'm considering underfloor heating downstairs and an electric boiler for hot water but no wet central heating system , just some electric rads upstairs or where needed . There will be a wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mo but interested to know if its worth it <p> Ian , I had assumed you had a wet central heating system already , given you had oil before . I assume you mean electric underfloor ? If you do n't  want a wet system , you need to look at infrared . It is a simple and elegant solution that does n't  require a wet system . It will be more efficient than standard electric rads and the cost would be competitive . <p> Solar thermal for your hot water and potentially solar PV are still good options to complement it . <p> Very informative article . I was going to ask where you felt air source heat pumps fitted into the question , so glad to see it covered in the comments .

If so , then the electric storage heaters are not such a bad idea but a new energy efficient heating oil boiler may trump it . So really it depends on the boiler you currently have ? <p> How much can I expect to pay for infrared radiator panels for a 4 bed detached house ? We have a large area of tiles on the fascia lacking in insulation behind them . How much insulation is required to cover the breeze block jnner wall before rendering ? What can I expect to pay for this ? Which of the 2 above will be the most cost effective ? If I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help ? I am 65 and retired . <p> Hi Susanne , They are an efficient type of electric heating , but they require a very well insulated property to run correctly and are very costly to install . The Government has tried to help with the upfront costs by providing the RHI which is a payment for producing the electricity . The theory is that if an ASHP costs about 8-10k to install then the RHI payments will cover this install cost over 10 years , although there is a formula that derives your exact payment based on the heat demand for your property and the seasonal performance factor ( basically the efficiency ) of the heating system that gets installed . <p> Hi Ben , Yes an air source heat pump is certainly worth considering . Having said that , you would require a really well insulated house for this to actually be worthwhile since they heat the house at a far lower temperature , so before they are installed you have to make sure heat loss is minimised . As you correctly mentioned though , provided you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renewable Heat Incentive make these a really sound financial investment .

Even so , there is a wide range in the quality of glazing , with older conservatories probably having single glazing , whilst modern conservatories will have much better quality double or triple glazing .

Make sure the door is fully draught-proofed and any other possible sources of draughts are blocked off . It also worth installing blinds or drapes that can be opened when you want the warmth of the sun to heat the room , but closed when you want to retain the heat that you are generating from your heater . <h> Floors make a difference <p> Whilst most heat rises and will leave your conservatory though the glass , some heat will be lost downwards through the floor . You also walk about on the floor , so if it is very cold , the room will feel even colder than the thermometer might suggest . <p> What can you do ?

Convection heaters will allow the heat to rise vertically , with much of the heat lost through the glass without having a chance to warm you .

Working in the field of GRP enclosures I see many properties both commercial and residential that are simply wasting money on their fuel bills in the winter unnecessarily . <p> We actually managed to squeeze in a 600watt infrared heating panel on the wall and plugged in a 450watt on the otherside of the conservatory .

@@36748919 @5748919/ <h> The running costs of infrared heating <h> August 28 , 2015 <p> If you have been reading TheGreenAge blog for a while , you will know that we are pretty keen on infrared heating . <p> If you live in a home that does n't have access to mains gas , then unfortunately your heating choices are pretty limited , you can either go for a heat pump , storage heaters , electric convection heaters or the infrared heaters . <p> The reason infrared heaters are our preference is that they are affordable ( a ground source heat pump for example can cost upwards of -20,000 which makes them too expensive for most ) and they are also efficient . <h> FROM -179.99 <p> The concept of infrared is that instead of heating the air like a traditional radiator ( or storage heater ) , the infrared heaters heat solid objects directly . Once the infrared panels get to temperature , the units emit infrared radiation that travels unimpeded until it hits a solid object i.e. a person or some furniture . This object absorbs the infrared and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that you are not wasting energy heating air that can easily escape up chimneys or through draughty windows . You are just heating the objects that require heating . Now considering you are heating surface area instead of volume you do get huge energy savings " but it is easy to say " what are the numbers that back up these huge savings ? <h> Running costs of infrared versus electric convection heating <p> The savings from infrared all come due to the sizing of the system . Typically an infrared heater just 40% the size of a traditional convection radiator will produce the same level of comfort . So a 1kW convection heater will produce the same level of comfort for the occupant as a 400w infrared heating panel . <p> This is where the savings come from ! Typically we recommend using between 50 watts and 100 watts per m2 depending on how well insulated a space is . A better insulated space will be closer to the 50w/m2 while an old uninsulated property will be nearer the 100w/m2 . <p> So look at the table below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following assumptions : <p> There are 120 days in winter ( approx. beginning of November till end of February ) <p> Infrared Heater <p> Electric Heater <p> Wattage of heater ( w ) <p> 400w <p> 1200w <p> Total units used per hour ( kWh ) <p> 0.4kWh <p> 1.2kWh <p> Cost of running unit for 1 hour <p> -0.05 <p> -0.15 <p> Cost of running for 5 hours each day <p> -0.25 <p> -0.75 <p> Total running cost- over winter period <p> -30.00 <p> -90.00 <p> So in this simple example we are looking at a saving of -60 per year by installing infrared over a standard electric panels heating , but it is worth pointing out that this does not take into account the speed at which the heat is felt using infrared . <p> When an infrared heater is turned on , the panel will heat up and start producing the infrared within just a couple of minutes , it is then that the occupant will feel the warmth . <p> With an electric convection heater , the heater needs to get warm and then this needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once the air gets up to temperature , that the occupant will feel the heat . <p> Bearing this in mind , the savings from the infrared heaters stated in the table are actually underestimated . <h> Comparing electric heating versus gas central heating <p> With gas costing just 3.5p/kWh , it is pretty clear to see that the cost of heating a home with gas is considerably cheaper than heating a home with electricity , but there is one important point to consider . <p> When using any form of electric heating , you can heat specific rooms as required , simply by turning on the electric heating units in those rooms . When using a gas central heating system it is much harder , even through the use of thermostatic radiator valves . The reason is that the boiler still needs to fire even if it only needs to provide enough hot water to heat one radiator . <p> So while gas central heating is a great way to heat your home , the fact that you can zone your heating with electrical heating so easily ( i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case for opting for gas over electric is n't completely black and white . <p> So in conclusion , if you are going for electric heating and do n't have funds readily available to go for a heat pump , we would really recommend infrared heating as a means of heating your home or business . The running costs of infrared heating versus electric convection heating illustrate there are large savings to be had by making the swap to infrared . <p> The case for infrared over and above a gas central heating system is less compelling , but still the ability to only heat rooms as required and the low install and maintenance costs mean that infrared should not be discounted . <p> Alternatively , if you would like us to find you a local installer to help install infrared heating in your home , just fill in the form below and we will be in touch shortly ! <h> Installing infrared heating <p> Are you thinking local installer map . <p> &gt;&gt;&gt; GO TO OUR LOCAL INSTALLER MAP NOW &lt;&lt;&lt; s Alternatively , if you would like us to find you a local installer to help install infrared heating in your home , just fill in the form below and we will be in touch shortly ! 184576 @qwx384576 184572 @qwx384572 <h> 3 comments <p> My company has a night time cleaning crew that cleans buses at night .

So to take our water wheel with the windmill on top again as an example the water has been flowing through the wheel for a whole hour now , which has produced the energy that is needed to turn the wheel. - If we want to find the total amount of water that has passed through , rather than the rate , we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has taken . <p> So to compare that to a microwave with a 800W rating .

So the total amount of energy consumed by running an 800W microwave for 15 minutes is 0.2kWh .

The same goes for other appliances like ovens and microwaves " lower wattage does n't necessarily mean more- energy efficiency ! <p> Another place you will see power ratings are on lightbulbs .

@@36748923 @5748923/ <h> 5 reasons to install an EV home charging point <h> July 20 , 2017 <p> Electric cars have several benefits . They 're far better for the planet , they are cheap to run , and they rarely need maintenance.But sometimes there is an idea that they are inconvenient to run , which puts people off . In fact , there 's nothing particularly difficult about it . There are a few options when charging an electric car . You can charge it from the mains using an extension lead , you can do- it at a public charging point , or you can install a home charging point. - Here , we are going to run you through why having a charger at home is a good idea . You 'll still have to use public charging points on long journeys , but day-to-day , its cheaper and easier to have your own . <h> Home EV charging points are cheaper <p> Youll have to cover the installation costs yourself , but the OLEV grant gives you- 75% of the cost of the charger , up to a maximum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charging costs will be much cheaper . The cost of home charging will vary depending on the model of car and your electricity tariff , but a full charge might cost as little as -3 meaning your car could cost as little as 2p per mile to run. - You will just pay your- normal electricity unit price , rather than -1-1.50 an hour for charging in public ( or up to -7.50 an hour for rapid charging ) . <p> If you 're on Economy 7 or a time of use tariff , you could save even more money by charging your car with cheap off-peak electricity . <h> Home EV charging points are faster <p> Depending on its size , a home electric charging point can charge your car from flat to full in anywhere between 1 and 7 hours . This is definitely quicker than charging from the mains , which takes a minimum of six hours . Its also quicker than public charging , unless you use a rapid charging point but these are n't  cheap . <h> Home EV charging points are more convenient <p> Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charging point gives you absolute control over when you charge your car . Charging points can be hard to come by in some areas of the UK , and if you 're not first in line , you could easily find yourself hanging around waiting for the person in front to finish charging. - At home , you can just plug it in and carry on with whatever you want to do ! - As most electric cars have a range of 200-300 miles , home charging will be enough for everyday use , meaning you 'll only have to top it up at public charging stations on long journeys . <h> Home EV charging points may be- better for battery life <p> An electric- car battery is no different to other batteries charging it over and over will eventually affect how well it can hold its charge , and its efficiency will be reduced. - Charging it to near full when possible , rather than just for an hour or two , might be better for it in the long run and this will be easier to do if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can improve property value <p> There are almost 100,000 electric car owners in the UK at the time of writing May 2017 and as- more and more people opt to go electric , an electric car charging point can be an attractive addition for would-be buyers . <p> Most chargers are pretty discreet- and also easy to uninstall/relocate if- need be . <h> From -470.00 <h> Installing an EV charging point <p> Interested in having shortly ! <p> Interested in having a home EV charging point installed ? 184572 @qwx384572 184569 @qwx384569 184566 @qwx384566 <h> What are the potential problems with air source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source heat pumps are a popular way to heat your home off-grid . They are efficient , take up little space , and can heat your hot water as well . So , what are some of the pitfalls and problems that come with an ASHP installation ? <h> Quality of ASHP unit <p> Just like with boilers , there are good quality units and there are bad quality units . ASHPs can be quite expensive , and that can lead the consumer to go for a lower-quality product . Furthermore , because the market is- fairly new and people do n't  necessarily know the best brand names , it is easier to fool the customer into thinking they are getting a good quality system when perhaps they are not . <p> Low-quality ASHP units can come with plenty of problems . They tend to have smaller heat exchangers more liable to freezing in British winters . This can lower the efficiency of the heat pump as it tries to defrost itself . Better quality units designed for the British market have larger heat exchangers which are designed to avoid- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <h> Siting the heat pump <p> The heat pump needs to be sited in the right spot . If sited incorrectly , the efficiency will likely be much lower , as the air that is released from the heat pump is drawn back in the other side . The other thing is noise they are n't that bad , but we have heard stories of neighbours taking issue with them , so do yourself a favour and keep them happy . Make sure the pump is sited away from your neighbours house just in case . <h> Quality of installer <p> Being a relatively new technology , there are plenty of cowboys out there who do n't know what they are doing . Make sure you use only MCS-accredited installers for this kind of work , and do your due diligence to ensure the installer has good feedback from other customers . <h> Inappropriate property for ASHP <p> You can have a perfectly installed heat pump , but if the property is draughty and poorly insulated , the heat pump is never going to get the property up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and radiators sufficiently sized . This is something that an installer should check as part of the initial survey , but make sure that this is checked one way or another ! <p> Its also very easy to get suckered into getting a heat pump when your property is on the gas grid and it would actually be cheaper to run off a gas boiler . Even though heat pumps are one of the most efficient ways to heat with electricity , they are still more expensive than using a gas boiler . This is because the price of gas is around 3-4 times cheaper than electricity , and any efficiency gains from the heat pump will not- be enough to compete with the low cost of gas . We only usually recommend heat pumps for those off the gas grid . <h> Claim your RHI <p> For those who are aware of the Renewable Heat Incentive , this part is obvious . Unfortunately , there are people installing heat pumps that are not aware of the scheme and leave it too late to claim , or have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore ineligible . Do n't make this mistake as it could cost you several thousand pounds . Once installed , you have 12 months to apply for the RHI , or you will miss out . 184563 @qwx384563 184570 @qwx384570 184567 @qwx384567 184575 @qwx384575 184577 @qwx384577 184572 @qwx384572 184573 @qwx384573 184566 @qwx384566 <h> Have you got a cold conservatory ? here 's how you can fix it ! <h> July 13 , 2017 <p> A conservatory can be a great addition to your home , but it can also bring problems . It can be difficult to know how to heat it , and the fact it is built from glass means it does n't  retain heat well. - Aside from being expensive for your bills , and potentially attracting damp , it is pretty frustrating not to be able to sit comfortably in a part of your own home . Too cold in the winter , too hot in the summer ; it can be really difficult to reach a balance . <p> Obviously , glass is nothing like as good at insulating as solid walls , so hot air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold air can get in from outside . To be honest , although you can limit it by opting for double-glazed glass , some degree of heat loss will always be inevitable with a conservatory . There are things you can do to offset some of the problems though ; were going to run you through a couple here . <h> Insulate your conservatory ceiling <p> A modern method of increasing the energy efficiency of your conservatory is to attach insulation to the inside of the roof . Clearly , you will lose some of the natural light entering your conservatory , but it will still come through the walls , and you will be able to create a more comfortable environment . Insulating drastically reduces the amount of heat that can pass through a surface , and because heat rises , ceiling insulation is a measure that can make a real difference . As well as keeping your conservatory warmer in the winter months , it will also stop some of the thermal gain from sunlight hitting your roof in the summer , meaning the room will not overheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> First , battens are fixed to the inside of the roof . Quilted foil insulation is then added between battens , and more battens are attached on top of this . Finally , it is all covered with plasterboard and skimmed with plaster , to create a smooth surface for painting. - Ventilation must be added to ensure the insulation does n't  encourage damp , by allowing condensation to collect between surfaces . <p> Its a relatively cheap and quick process , and wont cause much disruption to the household . <p> The insulation works as a barrier to prevent heat rising through the glass ceiling . In fact , the measure can reduce heat loss from the conservatory from 90% to as little as 10%. - It also stops sunlight causing the room to overheat . <p> For help finding a local installer for the measure , fill in the contact form at the bottom of the page . <h> Install infrared heating <p> The main issue with conservatories is that their temperature is badly affected by draughts . Normal convection heating ( i.e. radiators ) heats the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conservatories . Because infrared heats via ( safe ) radiation instead , its easier to reach a certain temperature and maintain it . Infrared heat rays heat the fabric of the building , and its contents , directly . <h> From -419.99 <p> Herschels Aspect heater is a great option . Its a stylish and discreet bar heater that can be placed on the wall and will direct heat down and outwards , heating the floor , the furniture and you ! This thermal mass will then stay warm and continue to radiate heat , even after the heaters are turned off . You will feel radiant heat even if draughts enter the conservatory , because infrared is a completely different , more direct form of heating . You can also get portable infrared heaters for extra boosts of heat when sitting there on a cold day . <p> It goes without saying that your conservatory will never be the warmest room in your home , but if you want to heat it , infrared definitely makes the most sense . <p> Interested in having your conservatory insulated ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are kiloWatt-hours and what is the cost per mile of an electric car ? <h> July 11 , 2017 <p> Prices correct as of July 2017 <p> When you 're thinking about buying an electric car , you 'll hear lots of technical terms bandied around . You may get told , for instance , that a car will cost a certain amount to run per kiloWatt-hour . This might not mean much to you or me ! What does it mean in real terms ? <h> What is a kWh ? <p> A kiloWatt-hour is the most common unit for measuring electricity usage . Watts have- been used for a long time to measure the electricity requirement of lights and appliances , and the kWh ( 1000Watts ) is now used to measure the efficiency of electric car models . Roughly speaking , the cost per kWh in an electric car is the equivalent of what you pay per litre for petrol or diesel at the pumps with a normal car . In- practical terms , the way to explain the cost of kiloWatt-hours used by electric cars goes something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pay for one hour of electricity from the National Grid . The average price per unit ( kWh ) is 12.5p , but it depends on your tariff and provider . <p> The second is the size of your cars battery in kWh . The larger the capacity of your electric cars battery ( in kWh ) , the further it will be able to go before recharging . But it will take longer to charge in the first place ! <h> So how much does it cost to charge an electric car ? <p> To work out- the charging costs of an electric car , simply multiply the cost of electricity per unit- ( kWh ) by the battery capacity of the model in kW . <p> Let 's take the example of a standard single-rate electricity tariff and a mid-range electric car ( Renault Zoe ) : <p> 12p x 41kWh = 492 <p> This means a total home charging cost ( to full battery capacity ) of -4.92 . <h> How does this cost per kWh compare to cost per litre for a normal petrol car ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of petrol per litre- and multiply it by the size of the fuel tank in this case , we have taken the example of a 45l Renault Clio . <p> -1.19 x 45l = -53.55 <p> So a full tank of petrol will cost you -50 , but a full charge of an electric battery will cost a fiver . <p> Its worth saying at this point that you cant really compare like-for-like , as the range ( i.e. how far a car will get before requiring re-fuelling/recharging ) is different for petrol and electric cars . The majority of petrol cars have a range of around 2-3 times that of an electric car . Costs per mile are difficult to estimate because of the wide number of variables that affect them . Clearly , how long exactly this 41kWh lasts/how far it gets you depends on your driving speed and the load of the car , among other things . So the real-life range will be different from the one specified by the manufacturer . This aside , - there is still a big difference in the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out far cheaper per mile . <h> Cost per mile of electric cars <p> To work out the cost per mile to run an electric car , you divide the cost of charging per mile by the range of the car . If we round up the -4.92 charging cost for the Renault Zoe above , and use the manufacturers specified range ( 250 miles ) , we get : <p> 5/250 = 0.2p per mile . <p> Compare this to the cost per mile of the petrol car above ( more than -1 ) and you can see why electric cars are known for their efficiency ! <p> As mentioned above , real costs would probably be slightly higher , because this range assumes full efficiency , but hopefully we 've explained why electric cars are a cheap option , at least in terms of running costs . These could be reduced even further if the battery was charged at- off-peak times with an Economy 7 or time of use tariff. - The cheapest way to charge an electric car is at home , and the easiest way of doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Installing an electric car- charging point <p> Interested in having shortly ! <p> Interested in having a home EV charging point installed ? 184572 @qwx384572 184569 @qwx384569 184566 @qwx384566 <h> Can I get an air source heat pump if I live on the coast ? <h> July 6 , 2017 <p> A few people have asked us- whether it is possible to have an air source heat pump if they live- near the coast . This might seem an odd question at first , but there are good reasons to be- careful when considering getting an air source heat pump on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumps are a great way to heat an off-grid property . They are usually cheaper to run than an oil boiler or electric heating , plus you will receive government Renewable Heat Incentive payments . <p> Normally , you wont have any problems running a heat pump , but if you live by the coast , you need to be aware that an air source heat pump is particularly vulnerable to corrosion from the salty air . Any property within 4 miles of the coast should be aware of this issue and your installer should be informing you and letting you know your options . <h> Avoiding corrosion with coastal heat pumps <p> Whilst corrosion can be a real issue for coastal heat pumps , there is a solution . There are protective coatings that can be applied to the heat pump to avoid corrosion . These are applied at the time of installation and may need touching up over the life of the unit . This is a simple and effective way to avoid expensive repairs and ensure the longevity of the heat pump unit . <h> Sizing coastal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more exposed , and so the heat pump will usually need to be sized slightly larger to accommodate the additional heat loss associated with the location . This is not a reason to avoid having a heat pump , but it is important that the system is sized correctly as an undersized pump will not get your home up to temperature . <h> Locating your heat pump <p> The location of your heat pump is really important . This is true for any heat pump , whether on the coast or inland , but we feel it is important to emphasise . Heat pumps need to be away from walls and fences , and need to allow good air flow around them . If this is not the case , air can leave the unit and go back into the intake . This lowers efficiency and is therefore something you 'll want to avoid . <h> Getting a heat pump on the coast <p> If you are worried about the lifespan of an air source heat pump in your locality , it might be a good idea to look at alternatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source heat pumps take their heat from the ground rather than the air , there is no danger of corrosion . Biomass is also a possibility in more remote locations outside of cities where air quality regulations are less strict and more space is available . 184563 @qwx384563 184570 @qwx384570 184567 @qwx384567 184575 @qwx384575 184577 @qwx384577 184572 @qwx384572 184573 @qwx384573 184566 @qwx384566 <h> Volvo announce switch to electric cars <h> July 5 , 2017 <p> Great news this morning " Volvo have announced that from 2019 onwards they will not be making any cars that solely run on internal combustion engines ( normally petrol or diesel ) . Instead the car giant will be adding electric battery technology to all cars built . <p> Volvo is looking to introduce a portfolio of electrified cars across its model range , embracing fully electric cars , plug-in hybrid cars and mild hybrid cars . Between 2019 and 2021 , it will launch 5 fully electric cars , 3 of which will be Volvo models and the other 2 will come via their high-performance car arm , Polestar . This announcement represents perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional car makers , in the move towards electrification .

The benefits of electric cars are becoming more widely known , and the market will only increase. - A quarter of UK carbon emissions- are from road transport , petrol and diesel cars are increasingly unpopular since the VW emissions scandal . Manufacturers and potential buyers are currently supported by generous government grants to help EU countries reach ambitious carbon reduction targets for tackling climate change and urban air pollution . <p> This announcement also comes on the back of battery prices dropping dramatically ( as a result of mass production ) and it seems the fabled $100/kWh price is only months away ! <p> Where once electric cars were a gimmick , they are now an attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mean for the petrol car market ? <p> Volvo estimate that by 2025 they will have sold 1m electrified cars ( either hybrid or full electric ) .

We predict that well be seeing more and more electric cars on the roads in the coming years , with people increasingly switching on to their benefits . <h> Installing an EV charging point <p> Interested in having shortly ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 184572 @qwx384572 184569 @qwx384569 184566 @qwx384566 <h> What is an air to air heat pump ? <h> July 4 , 2017 <p> Heat pumps are an often misunderstood way to condition your home , so in this blog we are going to demystify the air source heat pump and find out if they could be a good option for your home . <h> How do air to air heat pumps work ? <p> Air source heat pumps have been around for a long time . More people know them by their common name : the air conditioning unit . In the UK , they are more often found in offices than in the home , but they are becoming more popular for domestic properties , particularly in new builds . The difference with modern heat pumps is that they can actually heat a property , as well as cool- it . <p> The unit works by taking in heat from the outside air . This heat is amplified using a compressor and then released into the home . With an air to water heat pump , the heat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through radiators or underfloor heating . With- air to air heat pumps , warm air is emitted directly from the unit . <p> Of course , with an air to air heat pump , you will need to have ducting around the house to allow the air to circulate . With an air to water system , a conventional radiator or underfloor system will be required . <h> Are air to air heat pumps good for domestic properties ? <p> Air to air heat pumps are a very efficient way to heat a property . That is why many larger commercial buildings will use a heat pump with integrated ducting to condition a property . They also have the added advantage of being able to cool during the summer and heat during the winter , where central heating systems do not . <p> Air to air is often not practical for domestic properties because of the additional ducting required , but for a large scale retrofit or new build , it could be a viable option . Using warm air to heat a home is actually really efficient and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must remember that whilst air to air heat pumps are pretty efficient , they are usually more expensive to run than a gas central heating system because of the relative price of gas to electricity . We usually recommend sticking with gas central heating if that is available where you live , if cost is the major consideration . <p> One more thing to remember is that an air to air heat pump will not heat your hot water , whereas an air to water pump can be used to help heat your hot water too . This can save money because immersion heating of hot water is very expensive . <h> How much do air to air heat pumps cost ? <p> Because central heating is not required , air to air heat pumps will actually cost less to install than an air to water equivalent . The more difficult part of the installation is working out how to include the ducting , as this is not normally considered in a home heating installation . Depending on the size of the property , you will likely be looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of the ducting . <h> Are there any grants for heat pumps ? <p> The governments Renewable Heat Incentive is available for air to water and ground source heat pumps , but not available for air to air pumps . The RHI pays out a few thousand pounds over 7 years following the installation of an air to water heat pump , so it may be worth going for this option once you have crunched the numbers . <p> There are currently no government grants available for air to air pumps . <h> Air to air vs. air to water heat pumps <p> As we have touched on , there are a couple of factors you need to consider when deciding between the two , so we have made a list of pros and cons for you to help decide : <h> Air to air <p> Cheaper to install than air to water , dependent on the cost of ducting . <p> Provides excellent conditioning of rooms and heats quicker than radiators <p> Can also be sued to cool property as well as heat . <h> Air to water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook up to existing radiators or underfloor in most cases <p> Can heat your hot water as well as central heating <p> So we hope this has helped you work out what is right for your property .

A qualified assessor visits your property and- looks at every- aspect of the building and the systems within it and gives it a rating from A-G , with A being the most efficient property possible . The survey can be done in as little as an hour , and afterwards you can- be sent a personalised recommendations report , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the property . This considers things- like the heating system and how much insulation the property has , and how installing or updating them could improve your rating . <p> EPCs can be split into two categories domestic and commercial and its a legal requirement to have an EPC of a certain rating if you are renting out a property ; but more and more people are choosing to get an EPC on their own home . Let us explain why ! <h> Commercial EPC <p> Getting an- EPC every ten years has been a legal requirement for every rented property since 2007 , but stricter guidelines have recently been brought in. - The new Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards ( MEES ) require your property to have a rating of E or above on your EPC . If not , the- landlord will not be allowed to let the property , and will be liable to pay a fine of up to -150,000 . Ensuring properties are not hugely inefficient has two benefits : ensuring some level of protection for tenants against high energy bills , and reducing carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to take EPC ratings into consideration . A more energy efficient property means cheaper bills for those living in the property , - and happy tenants are more likely to pay their rent on time ! It also means- less work for property developers if you ever come to sell . Therefore , if you 're looking to sell or rent out your property , its worthwhile making sure it has the- best chance of a good rating . All potential tenants and buyers- are legally entitled to see this information before making any decisions . <h> Domestic EPC <p> Although not required by law , getting a domestic EPC is a great way to get to grips with how you could make your home more efficient . Knowing the best ways to improve your homes energy efficiency can be a bit alienating for the ordinary homeowner , so its useful to have a guide of what to think about. - If you make the changes suggested ( some of which , like insulation , are fairly cheap ) , you could find it cuts your bills significantly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic EPC normally only costs around -50 and the benefits are clear cheaper energy bills , a warmer home and the knowledge that you are reducing your carbon footprint ! <h> Getting an EPC <p> Need an EPC ?

The national rollout scheme originally intended to be completed in 2020 is now encountering more problems , with fears that rising costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rollout delayed <p> The rate of installations needs to increase , as its been much slower than first hoped. - Up to 7 million smart meters have been installed to date in the UK , of the 53 million originally intended by 2020. - The cost to suppliers of rolling out the scheme is rising , as many customers have been harder to persuade than expected . <p> Due to a lack of clear advice , a lot of people fail to see the benefits of having a smart meter installed especially as it basically means taking a day off work . Scaremongering has n't  helped , with theories circulating about ulterior motives for collecting customers usage information ! - Momentum has also been halted by serious technical issues , as some peoples meters have stopped working after switching supplier , despite repeated assurances otherwise . <h> Rising costs of smart meters <p> There has been a lot of criticism that the scheme has been badly run and suggestions it should be be paused and reconsidered , before costs spiral further . The cost per household of having a smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative costs from chasing hard-to-reach customers . Although householders wo n't shoulder the whole cost of installation , a fraction will be passed on to them via their energy bills exactly how much- remains to be seen . <p> The increased cost per household has been blamed in part for the big six energy companies recently rising bills . If bill payers end up shouldering higher costs for installation , it will contradict promises made by the government , further fueling- mistrust . <h> What 's next for smart meters ? <p> The government included its commitment to smart meters in the Queens Speech to Parliament . There was a veiled admission of defeat in the subtle change of wording used ; there 's now only a promise to offer a smart meter to every household by 2020 . This buys them more time to ( hopefully ) iron out all the problems Something that might worry some people is the fact that the Queens Speech also mentioned the possibility of smart meter regulations being changed in the future . <p> Many already have fears over how data will be stored and used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  collect any more data than ordinary meters , and energy companies cant share it unless you give them explicit permission . <p> Importantly , no-one will be forced to have a smart meter installed but there is still a lot of hope for their benefits , provided current issues are resolved . Proponents say that the positives of smart meters will mean they pay for themselves in the future , but in order for the benefits to be realised , the majority of UK residents need to be persuaded to co-operate . The government and energy companies have a lot to do to reassure people and encourage them that getting a smart meter is in their best interests . <p> Have you had a smart meter installed ? Do you think they are a good thing , or an expensive mistake for the UK ? - <h> What to think about when installing solar panels <p> Solar panels are a popular choice for those wanting to generate their own electricity . They 're relatively quick to install , easy to maintain , and can save you money while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider when thinking about installing them , though " we are going to run you through some of these . <p> The three main things to think about : <p> The roof you install the solar PV system on should ideally face between south-east and south-west . <p> The inverter ( which changes the direct current generated into alternating current to be used by domestic appliances ) should be placed close to the PV panels , to minimise transmission losses . <p> The roof should not be prone to overshading from trees or other buildings . <h> Placement/angle <p> Be careful about the placement of your panels . Although solar PV panels are at their most efficient when facing south , they will still generate some electricity in other generations but not as much . It 's worth taking this into account when thinking about whether or not your home is suitable . North-facing orientations should be avoided . <p> The angle of the panels is also really important . A mid-point between horizontal and vertical " such as a typical UK house roof at around 32- will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , so the minimum tilt you need to allow rain to wash away dust is 15- off horizontal . If your array will be facing east or west , a shallower tilt angle will work better , as the sun is lower in the sky as it moves away from due south . If you have a flat roof , you can mount panels on frames and angle them where they will get the best yield possible . <p> You can get an automatic- solar tracker , which moves your panels to make sure they are always facing the sun . However , these are more expensive and do n't  perform as well as their stationary counterparts in harsh weather conditions . <h> Shadowing <p> Shadows have a big impact on the performance of solar panels . If your panels are even slightly shaded by large trees or nearby buildings , they will not work as effectively . This is because solar panels are connected into strings and even- if only one cell in a string is blocked , the output of the other panels in the string drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheat this to a certain extent by arranging modules so that shadows will affect one whole string if possible , rather than the end cell of multiple strings . <h> Inverter <p> Solar panels produce electricity in direct current ( DC ) , which needs to be converted into alternating current ( AC ) before it can be used in the home . Systems include an inverter for this reason , and to work at maximum efficiency , it should be installed as close to the panels as possible . Most choose to place it in the loft.The placement of your diverter is also important if you are hoping to claim Feed in Tariff payments . <p> It 's well worth doing your research to find a good solar PV installer , as they 'll know- all the above and will be able to ensure that it is taken into account . <h> Optional extras for maximum efficiency <h> Solar PV diverter <p> Installing a solar PV diverter will make sure you maximise savings on your bills , by allowing you to use as much of your self-generated electricity as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels that is not used straight away is sent to the National Grid , and you 'll have to pay to import electricity like anyone else- at times when the sun is n't shining . If you install a diverter , it sends surplus electricity you do n't  use to your immersion heater , meaning you 'll save money on water heating . <h> Solar PV battery storage <p> You could even go one further and install a solar battery storage system although itll cost you . This allows you to store the electricity you generate , to be used whenever you want it , leaving you less reliant on national energy stores , and cutting your bills even further- as a result . <h> Installing solar PV <p> Are you thinking about installing shortly ! <p> Interested in getting a solar PV system installed ? 184572 @qwx384572 
@@36748924 @5748924/ <h> El Ni+o and what it means for the UK <h> July 17 , 2015 <p> Forecast centres all over the world have now declared that an El Ni+o , the single most powerful force- within our climate system , has started in the Pacific . You- may think that what happens in the Pacific surely ca n't have any real influence over us here in the UK . Well if you thought that , you 're unfortunately wrong ! <h> What is El Ni+o ? <p> El Ni+o is where the Pacific Ocean is warmed to such an extent that it essentially throws the rest of the global climate system off the rails . The complex cycle between oceans and the atmosphere means that the world 's environment is held in a delicate balance and any slight change can result in catastrophic events . Now we 've all seen those Hollywood blockbusters that take things way over the top , but although El Ni+o wo n't destroy London in 5 hours , it will certainly play a huge part throughout winter . <h> Pacific winds causing temperature differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winds blow from east to west , causing warmer water to travel across to the western side of the vast expanse of the ocean . As a result , cold water is brought up from the depths around South America to replace the lost warm water in the East . The upwelling ' then causes a temperature difference across the Pacific . <p> The warmer water in the west then causes evaporation , leading to unsettled , wet weather . The cycle is then complete when cooler air starts to descend on the eastern side of the ocean . However , signs of an El Ni+o start when the transfer of warm water from east to west become less distinct . Meaning that upwelling ' is almost absent . <h> The halting of the cycle ! <p> This brings about a halting of the cycle and creates a more even temperature spread across the ocean . So , what 's wrong with that ? <p> Well , because the areas of warmth move , the areas of unsettled weather move too and the expected weather- patterns- vanish . The effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prediction is it will start in late August , kicking off in earnest in September . <h> So , what does El Ni+o mean for us- here- in the UK ? <p> The last time we had an El Ni+o event was in 2010 , and although the phenomenon was relatively small , the impact in the UK was pretty severe . - If you remember , Britain was brought to a complete standstill with weeks of ice and snow and an average December temperature of -10c , the lowest since records began ! <p> The warning signs are already there of El Ni+os return , and without wanting to scaremonger we recommend everybody takes the necessary steps to ensure a comfortable winter ! <h> Why is it essential to install insulation and heating now ? <p> The exact timings of El Ni+o remain unclear , with reports suggesting it may start as soon as later August .

@@36748925 @5748925/ <h> External Wall Insulation versus Internal Wall insulation <h> November 12 , 2014 <p> With the re-launch of the GDHIF , there has been a lot of renewed interest in insulating solid walls in properties . There are two ways to insulate this type of wall " either internal wall insulation or external wall insulation . <p> If your home has cavity walls , they can be injected with insulation . If your home has solid walls or if you have already had your cavity walls insulated and want further thermal comfort external wall insulation is- a great option . <p> In this article we are going to look at the pros and cons of both types of solid wall insulation , and hopefully help you in making a decision in which way to go ! <h> External Wall Insulation <p> External wall insulation involves adding insulation boards ( normally PIR boards , but this can be mineral wool ) to the external walls of the property and then rendering on top of the insulation to finish . <h> The pros of external wall insulation <p> External wall insulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property " 10cm of PIR insulating board added to the walls of a house will take the u-value down to less than 0.28 <p> The current building regulations for walls are not actually as stringent as this , so the energy savings will be substantial . We normally look at about a 35% energy saving if all the external walls are insulated . <p> External wall insulation also improves the wall 's ability to withstand the elements . The layer of insulation sits on top of the brick , protecting the brick work beneath it . This means that any planned remedial work ( like pointing between bricks ) can be put on hold " although if there are any structural issues these should obviously be sorted before insulating . The insulation will cover cracks , or any poor rendering " in fact in many cases it improves the external appearance of the property . <p> External insulation should not affect life in your home as much <p> External wall insulation also prevents penetrating damp entering the home , although it will have no impact on rising damp . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall furniture ( e.g. guttering ) so for many people this provides a good opportunity to check the integrity of it at the same time , resealing any leaks and replacing old pipework , before reattaching it to the wall . This is a nice added benefit of getting external wall insulation installed ! <p> Those who live underneath a flight path or on a busy road will know how a well-insulated house muffles the noise entering the home . External wall insulation is a fantastic way to help reduce the amount of noise entering the home . <p> External wall insulation also means no disruption to the occupants of the property " all the works are carried out externally so apart from the installers needing the odd cup of tea there should be no impact to those living in the house ! <p> A really key benefit of external solid wall insulation , often overlooked , is that the walls will continue to get warmed by the heating system . This means than when the heating is turned off , this stored warmth will be slowly released back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more even temperature . It also means that you wo n't ever get condensation on the walls which is obviously a huge benefit . <p> We have already mentioned that external wall insulation can give your home a face lift . In most cases the home is rendered to finish it , and a nice feature of this is that you can get the render in any colour you want . If you have always dreamt of the Barbie pink house , now is your chance ! <h> The Cons of- external wall insulation <p> Not all solid wall insulation is made equal . If you get companies round to quote for the works , ensure that the insulation is attached to the wall using both adhesive and mechanical fixings . If not , you risk the insulation coming away from the walls in time , which obviously is not going to be cheap to fix . Make sure that any company installing the insulation provides a 25-year industry warranty " this should give you the comfort you need to know the company you are going with really back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the bit of the roof that over hangs the wall ) is more than 100mm so the external wall insulation can butt right up to it . Unfortunately in some cases it is not and therefore the insulation needs to be capped at the top ( to prevent moisture getting down the back ) or the roof needs to be extended over the top of the insulation and this can be costly . <p> In most circumstances you do n't need any sort of planning permission / council permission to do works , however if you are in a conservation area or you live in a listed property , DEFINITELY seek permission before getting it installed . To be honest , we would always recommend calling the council and just flagging it " 99 times out of 100 they wo n't have any issues although if you happen to live in the borough of Merton ( who do n't seem to have a clue what is going on in their planning department ) they might kick up a fuss. - Obviously in certain circumstances planning wo n't be granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When external solid wall insulation is installed , the installer should go no where near the damp course " the insulation should start above it , but that does mean you get some cold bridging there . <p> You require scaffolding , which can add slightly to the cost , although if you try to do other works at the same time ( that require scaffolding ) then obviously you just pay once ! <h> Internal Wall Insulation <p> Internal wall insulation involves attaching insulation to the interior walls of the property , although only walls that are in contact with the outside air need to be insulated " e.g. in a mid terrace house , there is no need to insulate the walls between two properties . <h> The Pros of internal wall insulation <p> Like external wall insulation , insulating your home internally will lead to significant energy savings . This is obviously the main reason people would get the works done and we really do feel that insulation is one of the best ways at protecting yourself against energy price rises . <p> Internal wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property , so there are no planning concerns ( unless you live in a listed property , in which case you will need to seek permission ) . For a lot of people with solid brick properties , the look of the brick was an important selling point , so internal wall insulation allows you to retain that while still improving the energy saving potential . <p> Internal board insulation <p> Internal wall insulation is relatively easy to do , you can do one room at a time to minimise disruption . Ideally you coincide the insulating works with when you are decorating the property , since there is no way to insulate under the plasterboard without ripping down what is already there . <p> Also there are no added scaffolding expenses associated with insulating a property internally . <h> The Cons of- internal wall insulation <p> For many people , losing internal space is the major issue with internal wall insulation. - It is understandable to be honest . In Westminster for example 1m2 of property costs over -7,500 . <p> In a 5m x 5m room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner -15k . Obviously a stupid example , but it makes the point " many people are unwilling to give up any space ! <p> Unlike external wall insulation , where the amount of insulation that can be added is essentially unlimited , for internal insulation there reaches a point where people will be unhappy to lose the space which obviously puts a limit on the thermal efficiency one can achieve . <p> This was included in the pros for solid wall insulation , but internal wall insulation can lead to disruption " in some cases only one room will be done at any one time , but if that room happens to be the bathroom then that can be inconvenient . <p> With internal wall insulation you get cold bridging between the floors unless floorboards are lifted and the insulation is run uninterrupted down the wall . In the majority of cases this wo n't be done i.e. the insulation will stop when it hits the ceiling ( at ground floor level ) and when it hits the floor ( at first floor level ) . This means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetrating damp issues , these must be sorted prior to installing the internal wall insulation otherwise far worse issues can occur down the line . In addition the bricks will still be open to the elements , which potentially means that repointing / general maintenance still needs to take place . <p> One of the challenges for the installers is that a damp course layer must be used when the internal wall insulation is installed . Now this is n't an issue for the occupants except if they put a nail into the wall and it goes through the vapour layer . Once this is compromised , it can lead to all sorts of issues that will become very costly to install . <h> Final Thoughts <p> Unless you buy a house and are stripping it right back to the bare brick , then we would normally recommend external wall insulation over internal wall insulation . That is not to say it ca n't be as good " both solutions can go a long way to massive energy bill reduction " but just due to space constraints , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulation . <p> Once you insulate the walls you should be looking to achieve a u-value of 0.30 W/m2K or less ( remember the lower the U-value the better the thermal efficiency ) ; achieving this will bring the walls in line with cavity walls built today . <p> The Green Deal Home Improvement Fund ( GDHIF ) phase 2 is the ideal scheme to help cover much of the cost of the works the GDHIF solid wall insulation grant is for -4,000 + you can get an additional -500 if you have lived in the home for less than 12 months . It is not means tested and provided you have a Green Deal Report you can access it . The installer who does the work must be PAS2030 approved and enrolled on the scheme to get the GDHIF . The money is available and we can ensure you , it will never be as generous again so we suggest getting in quick ! 184574 @qwx384574 184572 @qwx384572 <h> 17 comments <p> Hi Chris , They really should n't I am sure this question is fielded due to the tragedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  want to speculate what happened there , but I would find it very unlikely a homeowner would ever get rain screen cladding on their property . The External wall insulation systems that do get installed on properties tend to have either EPS or mineral as the insulation material . From a fire point of view , mineral wool is better than EPS , but both these insulation materials would be completely enclosed in concrete adhesive ( on most systems ) , so there would be no point at which the fire would touch the insulation material , so once installed no , there should be no risk they catch fire . <p> Will my neighbours external I sulation of 150 mm affect my house ? We are semi detached I am worried there will be a water running affect from their protruding external walls and damp will lodge on my side . Please advise <p> It should be fine . The installer who is putting the product should use stop bead and render on top . On the top they should cap the system off with a verge trim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abut to . In any case the insulation I take it will go in between the party wall ( not encroaching on your side ) , so any damp issues should be mitigated . Best to speak to your neighbour and clarify the installation procedure . <p> Cathy , it should be ok to install over the top leaf assuming the existing cavity wall insulation is n't causing any other underlying problems , e.g. insulation has bridged the DPC , there is damp due to wet insulation , etc . Have a look at this article linked to EWI with existing cavity wall insulation for additional information LONG ... Hope this is of help . <p> Interesting article I have a few queries/comments because it feels stacked against interior insulation which is actually almost as efficient and much less expensive than exterior insulation : <p> 1 ) Floorspace 1 : " In Westminster for example 1m2 of property costs over -7,500 . In a 5m x 5m room , losing 10cm off all the internal walls would cost the owner -15k . " Have you got your example right here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the exterior wall , which would therefore probably be -3,750 rather than -15,000 ? To provide a fair comparison what you really need to do is provide a full example of interior and exterior insulating a full house , including the total cost of the job , payback period , and any differences in final heating bills . From what Ive seen elsewhere its much cheaper to interior insulate and the heating savings are within 5% of each other . In addition , how many houses are going to be worth -7,500p/sqm and in Westminster anyway ? ! <p> 2 ) Floorspace 2 : If you really want to preserve floorspace then you can remove existing plaster , therefore saving circa 2.5cm depending on plaster thickness , or even more if the property has been previously dry-lined on top of old plaster . <p> 4 ) Cons of internal insulation : These seem overstated i ) Having floorboards up to insulate between ground and first floors is not difficult for a competent builder or even DIY enthusiast , ii ) if installing a vapour layer it is not difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exterior walls " ; this is really an imaginery blocker . <p> 5 ) Warm up time : One would imagine that an internally insulated property would warm up much quicker than an externally insulated property because with external insulation you 've got thick ( cold ) walls to heat first , rather than a thin layer of plasterboard and then your insulation ? <p> Hi Jason , Thanks for your response , you definitely have some valid points there , but I just wanted to reply with our view on them : <p> 1 ) The example of Westminster is the extreme , but we see many people in flats in the suburbs who are very much against the idea of losing space . Space is really a problem through london and indeed much of the UK . Price is n't necessarily the number 1 concern here , its the practicalities of fitting furniture in an already small London room . <p> 3 ) When we talk about penetrating damp , we are talking about moisture getting through the porous brickwork , rather than rising damp . External insulation will definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that brickwork . Rising damp of course should be treated prior to insulation . <p> 5 ) I think the idea is that those thick cold walls are n't  as cold any more because of the external insulation . You do n't  cold start a house every time you turn the heating on . A normal house tries to maintain a temperature for the most part . <p> We had our walls insulated externally using GreenAge and BeConstructive ( GreenAge project managed ) . The difference in our house is absolutely massive , our heating is rarely on now , even during the recent cold snap . It is obviously not cheap , but for us it was defintely worth it , we took advantage of the -6ooo government grant which makes the payback a little under 4 years . The thing that we did n't  expect to be honest was the quality of the end result , the look of the house has really improved ( we used to have that God awful pebble dash ) . THe white render looks a lot cleaner . <p> All in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete and there was no disruption in the house at all . I would honestly recommend this to anyone with non-cavity walls ! <p> You only require a post 2012 EPC to access funding under the GDHIF not a full GDR . A GDR may also provide direction/ recommendations for other energy efficiency measures/grants . Your article also failed to mention that alternative finishes are available for external wall insulation like brick slips or stone . Factoring the cost of re plumbing a kitchen &amp; the refitting of kitchen units , replumbing &amp; fixing of radiator , bathrooms/showers etc all need costing into internal insulation works . These costs can sometimes outweigh the cost for scaffolding externally <p> You havnt explained about insulating a cavity wall externally and the effect that the cavity can have on the potentail energy savings . Obviously cavity insulation is the preffered option , but some may still think external insualtion is best for them , this only being true for a solid wall . With a cavity you get a hugh draught passing behind the insualtion which continues to cool the internal brickwork ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atemt to save energy . In both cases do n't  forget to insulate the ceiling and draught proofing ! <p> Hi Trevor , thanks for the comment . Agreed if you have a cavity , then worth looking at insulating that first , although we do have many people tell us they are not interested in putting anything in the cavity ( mainly due to concerns for damp ) so for these people solid wall insulation is worth it , but I take your point ! 
@@36748926 @5748926/ <h> Introduction to storage heaters <h> Heating <h> What are storage heaters ? <p> Storage heaters are a form- of electric convection heating . They work by heating the volume of air in a property which operates on a dual- tariff electricity meter such as Economy 7 or Economy 10 . It uses electricity supplied by the grid during periods of low tariff , to heat up storage elements within the heater . These storage elements , or storage bricks , then release the required amount of heat when required during times when electricity has increased to the on-peak rates . They are designed to be a cheap heating system because they- use the off-peak tariff , not because they use- less electricity . In reality , due to their relative inefficiency through leaking heat , they actually require more electricity than standard electric convector heaters . <h> What are the benefits of storage heaters ? <p> As storage heaters run off electricity , they do not require extensive plumbing or pipework , just a simple set of wires . This means that they are fairly cheap to install @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they use off-peak tariffs , they have traditionally been cheaper to run than other- electric convection heating methods . While old forms of storage heater may not be that efficient , new technology has made them- a more tempting option . Storage heaters can also be used in conjunction with renewable systems such as solar PV and wind turbines , and be charged for free whenever a surplus amount of electricity is being generated . <h> What are the problems involved with storage heaters ? <p> One of the main problems is leakage . It is impossible for a storage heater to store 100% of the heat generated . Therefore , they are required to store more heat than is actually required for the next day . This means that although electric convection heating is 100% efficient , storage heaters need to use more electricity than standard convectors . Another problem comes with time and temperature control . As the electricity is stored for the next days heating requirement , there is little movement if it 's exceptionally cold and not enough heat has been stored or it 's too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls on storage heaters <p> Storage heaters have varying controls depending on the style and age . These include automatic and manual input controls , power switches and thermostatic controls . New-age storage heaters even have access to weather conditions as well as intelligent controls and can alter the input depending on the predicted temperature within the property the next day . All storage heaters have the option of a boost setting , which just turns the storage heater into a standard electric convector on the peak tariff . <h> How do storage heaters compare with other heating systems ? <p> Gas central heating " cheaper to install but more expensive to run due to the cost of electricity being higher than gas . <p> Heat pumps " cheaper to install but more expensive to run due to heat pumps producing around 3-4 units of heat for every unit of electricity . <p> Oil boilers cheaper to install but more expensive to run due to the cost of electricity being higher than heating oil . <p> LPG boilers cheaper to install but more expensive to run due to the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage heaters <p> Allows you to take advantage of the- cheaper off-peak tariff electricity during the night . <p> Cheaper to install than complete central heating systems . <p> Little maintenance required . <h> Limitations of storage heaters <p> Unavoidable heating overnight may result in wasted energy . <p> It is difficult to deal with sudden changes of weather . Preset amounts of input do n't  allow for alterations . <p> Some companies lock customers into their tariffs by installing non-standard meters . Switching companies for your supplier then becomes prohibitively expensive . <p> Tend to be bulky . <p> The size also dictates how much charge ' the heater can take , so although you can get smaller heaters , they may not be able to provide all the heat you need . <p> Complicated controls . <h> Costs of storage heaters <p> Fan-assisted storage heaters cost around -500 + install . <p> Dimplex Quantum storage heaters cost around -700 + install . <h> Installing storage heaters find you a local installer for storage heaters , just fill in the form below and we will be in touch shortly ! <p> Interested in installing storage heaters ? 184572 @qwx384572 <p> So Valerie , the storage heaters charge at night and then release the heat during the day , so you need to put input ( i.e. electricity going into the system ) during the night on high and then output needs to be set for when you actually want your home to warm up . 
@@36748927 @5748927/ <h> Is the Flow boiler worth it ? <h> May 22 , 2015 <p> Earlier this year a new domestic boiler was introduced onto the market that produces hot water as well as electricity that can be used in the home to power lights and appliances . <p> The Flow boiler is a type of CHP boiler " where CHP stands for combined heat and power . Up to now , CHP boilers have been used to great effect in commercial heating situations as well as multi-dwelling properties but this is the first time a company have tried to crack the domestic CHP market aside from a very brief foray into the market by Baxi in 2011 . <p> Here we want to put Flow 's CHP offering under the spotlight , however we want to make it quite clear before we start , we have n't installed one of these boilers in our homes , this is purely based on the figures available on their website and general trends in the CHP market . <h> The Flow CHP Boiler offers <p> So the Flow has two offerings " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involves paying -3,675 upfront for your new boiler ( inclusive of VAT ) . You need to pay installation on top of this and the figure they state on their site is -1,800 but obviously this varies from house to house . Obviously if there is a lot of pipework to change then this number could escalate very quickly , but likewise if it is a relatively simple install then the install price could be lower . <p> Under this offer , you are required to sign up to Flow 's energy tariff , which is actually very competitively priced ( e.g. 10/11 p/kWh of electricity and 3/3.5p/kWh of gas depending where in the country you are ) . <p> You are required to pay for all the gas you use ( as you might expect ! ) but also all the electricity " you ca n't use the free electricity you produce " or at least you can but you have to pay for it ! <p> You are also required to sign over your Feed-in tariff payments to Flow for the 5 years of the offer . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month of -80 " so a total of -4,800 over the 5 years . <p> After the 5 years , you then can benefit from the FIT which get reassigned to you " this means you get paid 13.24p for every unit ( kWh ) of electricity you produce . <h> Getting a Flow Boiler without any upfront payments <p> The second offer is Flow Finance . <p> Like the name infers , this allows you to get the boiler on finance so there are no upfront costs . The finance costs -75.50 per month for 5 years " so the total payment is -4529.89 " this however does not include the cost of install , which in some cases can be added to the loan too . <p> Aside from that " the offer is the same as Flow Freedom , you need to take their energy tariff , you need to pay for all gas and electricity you use in the home and you need to assign the FIT over to Flow . <p> In return you will receive -80 reductions on your home energy bill every month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers stack up ? <p> Let 's compare the Flow Freedom offer with a normal boiler install " we have picked a -900 Worcester Greenstar heat only boiler from Plumbnation ( Inc VAT ) . <p> Install wise we have spoken to a variety of our partners and have come out at an install price of -900 ( inclusive of VAT ) including the installer margin . We have had one installer who will put this on the wall for just -600 though ! <p> Therefore for this normal boiler install we are looking at a price of -1,800 inclusive of VAT . <p> Under the Flow Freedom offer , the cost of the boiler + install ( based on their estimated prices ) would be -5,475 inclusive of VAT so about -3,675 more . <p> For a regular boiler though you need to pay for all the gas you use and you would n't get any rebate from the installer unless they were feeling particularly generous . <p> Under Flows offer you would get back -4,800 over the 5 years so the final cost to you would be -5,475 less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it certainly stacks up " especially when you take into account the Feed in tariff payments that would be due after the 5 year contract ' with Flow was up . However there is obviously the cash you need to find upfront ! <h> How much could the remaining FIT be worth to a household ? <p> This question is a little bit like how long is a piece of string to be honest , because it entirely depends on the amount of electricity produced by the system . <p> The boiler when it is running will generate 1kW of power , so if you generate a unit of electricity with it you are going to get paid 13.24 pence regardless of what happens with that electricity . <p> If you use the electricity in your home then you make a saving of about the same for each unit produced ( 10-15p / kWh ) since you do n't need to buy it from the grid . <p> You could export the electricity at 4.77p/kWh , but obviously the energy saving is far better ! <p> If the boiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the winter months for heating and remainder just for hot water ) then you would get paid just shy of -200 each year for the remaining 15 years of the tariff ( remember Flow take the first 5 years worth of tariff ) <p> This does n't take into account the energy savings if you manage to use the electricity " which could take the savings to -400 a year . <p> So again the numbers work here ! <h> So what is the downside of the Flow boiler ? <p> Firstly the current Flow boiler is an 18kW-condensing boiler that will heat a 3-5 bedroom house depending on heat demand . It also currently requires a separate hot water tank ( like a heat only boiler ) , therefore if you live in a small house where space is a premium it may not be for you . Likewise if you have a combi boiler already , then you will need to install a new hot water tank , which might be an inconvenience . Flow are working on both a combi version ( without hot water tank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The major flaw with CHP heating is that you can only produce electricity while the boiler is producing hot water so in domestic settings when the boiler is only on for an hour or so during the summer months to produce hot water for washing , the amount of electricity that will be produced is actually very small . Likewise there is no battery storage element to the flow so unless your boiler is on when you want to use the electricity it is likely going to get exported . However since you can program the boiler when to turn on the hot water and heating , it should n't be difficult to set this at a time when you are home in the evening . <p> Another issue is that since the Flow boilers are doubling as electricity generators , they will consume slightly more gas than a modern boiler when they are operating , and will increase the annual gas bill by about -40 . <p> The final issue and perhaps the most serious one is that CHP is a relatively unknown technology . Despite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the flow boiler only comes with a 2 year manufacturer 's warranty ( although if you stay with flow energy this will be extended to 10 years ) . <p> This for us is the biggest issue , one can very easily go and buy a new boiler with a 7 year + warranty " so why take the risk ! Why have n't any of the boiler big boys ( e.g. Vailliant , Worcester Bosch ) taken the jump into domestic CHP " their lack of activity could in fact be the most telling ! <h> 12 comments <p> I find your estimate for normal boiler installation low . British gas and independant local installers have quoted c. 3k for the job ( Worcester Greenstar ) . The house is 4 bed , nothing unusual and presently has a old combi boiler . Friends who have had new combis fitted have paid similar prices e.g around 3k . <p> Further , did n't  those Baxi CHP boilers have a reliability problem and were relatively complex to instal , I wonder if the flow boilers are any different ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we give are only as a guide I know that the price varies between installers significantly . In terms of the reliability issues , that is what scared me off too . I think you are absolutely right why would you risk an unproven technology ( or at least one that has n't  established itself yet in the market ) when you can get a Worcester Bosch or Vaillant boiler that comes with a 10 year warranty and you know will do the job ! <p> I think things will change when the export tariff ( the amount you get paid for exporting the electricity you produce ) becomes variable , so you get paid different amounts at different times of the day mainly because the Government will use this to try and stifle demand ( i.e. they will charge more for electricity at peak times to lower demand , so if you are selling the electricity you will get paid more ) . This would be the game changer for CHP but I think until the smart meter roll out takes place this would never work . <p> Find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be looking to convert the two one-floor flats I have into a two-floor duplex . My idea has been to use underfloor electric heating on one floor ( the colder basement level ) , and radiators on the ( easy to keep warm ) first floor . Do you know if the output figures of the Flow boiler make this a viable balance where most of one floors heating would be free ( after the FIT returns to me ) while the other floor is being heated ? A while ago I had been watching CERES with interest as they were seemingly going to develop a great household CHP , but they seem to have become a non-starter now . Thank you in advance Alex <p> I looked into the Baxi microCHP in 2011 . They adopted the Sterling technology . This was unsuited to short run domestic profiles , though superb for long running profiles such as hospitals etc . The Rankine technology is better suited to the domestic profile . That the big boys have n't adopted new technology is because their profit profile is still excellent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targets are very narrow . Their incentives , structures and management focus do n't  encourage new technology adoption . Narrow minded yes , currently profitable yes too . A big however is look at every vacuum cleaner manufacturers dismissal of Dyson . Look at GMs crushing of EV1 and their subsequent filing for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy . IBMs classic dismissal of PC technology . The list is endless . Go for it . <p> Hi David , that may well be the case ! We seem to be getting a lot of interest in the flow boiler , but I think at present people are a little concerned whether they are going to last compared to a new conventional boiler . Any thoughts ? <p> Does the amount of electricity produced vary with the temperature of the water ? If so , what temperature does the water have to be to generate electricity at the full rating of the generator ? Or preferably send me a graph of kilowatts against temperature . Thank you . <p> Last time I looked the gas and electric bits were covered for different time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complications No mention in there blerb about the extra gas consumption , and does the guarantee cover the cost of the once a year service which will probably cost more , did not know about the extra tank as well.how much water does it store because need to look at reheat time . You will only get your rebate for 5years as long as the company is still going presumably , <p> Unfortunately Flow downgraded their sales expectations for 2015 from 20,000 to 500 ! None of these have yet been installed , it would seem . As a result their share price halved , as you might expect . Even the Flow boiler which has the lowest electrical efficiency of any CHP boiler is fairly expensive and with just 500 being sold in 2015 , this is unlikely to change in the near future . A range of options will be available over the next 18 months with higher electrical efficiencies , so choose carefully if you 're interested . <p> Hi Paddy , I think the issue is reputation . Most people we come across have heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiler is a huge outlay ( I appreciate much of the cost is recovered ) but on essentially an unknown brand . <p> The is a fantastic guide on the flow boilers . We looked at one and I actually agree . It was the unknowns on the chp technology that made us stick with a conventional one . The price actually is n't too bad for them . <p> Hi , we tend to agree . I think the time for the flow boiler will certainly come , but at the moment with boiler manufacturers offering up to 10 year warranties on conventional boilers , it seems looking much beyond them seems a bit silly ! The flow CHP boiler will certainly have its time in the sun though especially if time of use tariffs come into play , and one can export electricity at peak times and actually make money from having the heating switched on . It seems a distant pipedream at the minute , but actually this could be a reality in the next 5 or so years ! 
@@36748928 @5748928/ <h> Double Glazing <h> Insulation <h> What is double glazing ? <p> All properties lose heat through their windows . Installing energy efficient double-glazing is an effective way of reducing your energy bills and keeping your home warmer and quieter . <p> Double-glazed windows use two sheets of glass with a gap between them which creates an insulating barrier , whilst triple-glazed windows have three sheets of glass . Both options can deliver a high level of energy efficiency ; it is not the case that you have to use triple-glazing to gain the most energy efficient window . <p> The- space between the glass panes can be filled with either a- vacuum ( quite rare nowadays because they require excellent sealing , otherwise the vacuum- diminishes so the efficiency- decreases ) , or a heavy- inert gas such as Argon , Krypton or Xenon . Both these methods are trying to create a more effective- insulating barrier , known scientifically as increasing the R-value ( which is the measure of thermal resistance ) . <p> Energy efficient double-glazed- windows are available in a variety of frame materials ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These windows- vary in their energy efficiency , depending on how well they stop heat from passing out- through the window , how much sunlight travels through the glass and the amount of air that can leak in or out around the window . <p> Some double-glazing- window and door manufacturers helpfully use a window energy rating scheme to show the energy efficiency of their product . This is similar to the one you may have seen on appliances such as your fridge , or washing machine . A-rated windows are the most efficient . To check a window 's energy efficiency before you buy , look at its energy label . <h> Questions to ask yourself before investing in double glazing : <h> 1. - How energy efficient are the windows ? <p> When choosing replacement double-glazed- windows , you can check their- energy efficiency by looking at the Energy Saving Trust Recommended logo and British Fenestration Rating Council ( BFRC ) energy label . The higher the energy rating , the more energy efficient it is.The Energy Saving Trust endorses any windows rated B or above . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window manufacturers to label their products ; however by opting for a highly-rated window you know you will be buying the most efficient . <p> For a list of all types of **28;274;TOOLONG windows and their frame material and energy rating , visit the- BFRC website. <h> 2. - How many layers of glass- is best ? <p> Double glazing has two layers of glass with a gap of around 16mm between them . There 's also the option of triple glazing , which has three layers of glass . Both A-rated double and tripled-glazed windows are available . <h> 3. - What type of glass is best ? <p> The most energy efficient glass for double-glazing is low emissivity ( Low-E ) glass . This often has an unnoticeable coating of metal oxide , normally on one of the internal panes next to the gap . It let 's sunlight and heat in but cuts the amount of heat that can get out again . <h> 4. - What is between the panes ? <p> Very efficient windows might use gases like argon , xenon or krypton in the gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 5 . What keeps the panes apart ? <p> All double-glazed windows have pane spacers set around the inside edges to keep the two panes of glass apart . For a more efficient window , look for pane spacers containing little or no metal " often known as warm edge spacers . <p> The BFRC window energy rating scheme checks all the components to ensure the final window achieves the energy efficient standard claimed . This means that you just need to look for the A-G ratings and remember A is best ! Alternatively , just look for the Energy Saving Trust Recommended logo which will only be found on glazing that is B rated or above . <h> 6. - Which frame suits your home ? <p> The frame you choose will depend on your home and your personal taste . For all frame materials there are windows available in each energy rating . <p> uPVC frames are the most common type . They last a long time and can be recycled . <p> Wooden frames can have a lower environmental impact , but require maintenance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows were timber framed . <p> Aluminium or steel frames are slim and long-lasting . They can be recycled . <p> Composite frames have an inner timber frame covered with aluminium or plastic . This reduces the need for maintenance and keeps the frame weatherproof . <h> 7. - Do you need ventilation ? <p> Because replacement double-glazed- windows will be more airtight than the original single-glazed frames , condensation can build up in your house due to the reduced ventilation . <p> If there is not a sufficient level of background ventilation in the room some replacement windows will have trickle vents incorporated into the frame that let in a small amount of controlled ventilation . <p> Condensation can sometimes occur on the outside of new low-e glazing . This is because low-e glass reflects heat back into the home and as a result the outside pane remains cool and condensation can build up in cold weather " you do n't  need to worry about it . <h> Benefits of installing double glazing <p> Smaller energy bills : replacing all single-glazed windows with energy efficient double-glazing could save you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A smaller carbon footprint : by using less fuel , you 'll generate less of the carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) that leads to global warming . <p> The costs and savings of double glazing will be different for each home and each window , depending on the size , material and installer. - Savings will also vary depending on how much you currently pay for your heating fuel ; these savings are based on a gas-heated home . <h> Installing double glazing <p> When you plan an installation , you need to know about building regulations and what to do if double-glazing does n't suit your property , as well as how to maintain your windows . When you think about replacement glazing , you need to make sure your windows are installed correctly and comply with all the relevant regulations . <h> Building regulations <p> New and replacement windows in existing homes in England and Wales must be at least WER band C or U-value 1.6 In Scotland must be at least WER band C or U value 1.6 In Northern Ireland must be at least WER band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.2 . <p> However , if you live in a conservation area , have an article four direction on your property or have a listed building , additional regulations are likely to apply . Before you do any work , make sure you check with your local planning office . An Article 4 direction removes the right of permitted development , meaning that you will have to apply for planning permission before replacing any windows . This is often applied in conservation areas . <h> How to comply with regulations <p> To make sure regulations are complied with , there are certain rules about the way you can install windows : <p> For DIY installations you must apply for building control approval before installing the windows . For professional installations , your installer should be registered with a competent persons scheme or register the installation through Local Authority Building Control . <h> Find registered installers <p> FENSA guarantees that its installers and frames comply with building regulations .

The u-value basically corresponds to the thermal efficiency of the window i.e. the rate at which heat is lost over the particular building material .

@@36748929 @5748929/ <h> How much electricity does my immersion heater use ? <h> January 23 , 2015 <p> If you have ever looked at your electricity bill you will see that electricity is measured in kiloWatt hours ( or kWh ) . A kWh is a unit of energy equivalent to one kW of power expended for one hour . <p> An average 3 bed home will use approximately 4,000 kWh of electricity per year ; that includes things like lighting , watching TV and running a dishwasher . <p> In some cases , people heat their water with electricity " normally through the use of electric immersion heaters that act like huge like kettles. - We often get asked whether these are expensive to run , so the following should help you work that out for yourselves ! <h> How many KW of electricity are needed to heat a hot water tank ? <p> So the two bits of information you will- need to help calculate this are the size of the tank measured in litres , and the required temperature rise . <p> The required temperature rise ( measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your cold water from the hot water temperature required .

It depends on the efficiency of your boiler , but new boilers are approximately 90% efficient . Therefore to produce one unit of useful heat you are looking at a cost of 3.3 pence . Electric heating is 100% efficient , so it will cost approximately 12 pence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating system then it is considerably cheaper ( about 1/4 of the price ) . <p> Hi Andy , how did you arrive at this figure of -1700 ish ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? to achieve this the immersion would need to run flat out for 6 months . If someone is going to make a claim let 's try to get a more realistic figure which should be achievable by the meter reading now the immersion is off . <p> Hi we had a new heating system fitted and the company who fitted it left the emersion on 24 hours 7days a week for 6 months how can we calculate how much this has cost us so we can claim it back many thanks <p> Hi Andy , on the face of it this is really simple i.e. if it is 3kW rated immersion , then each hour this is on it will cost approximately 40p ( depending on how much you pay for electricity but simply multiply your tariff rate by 3 ) . This would give a figure of -1728 over the 6 months the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to them . This means when the water in the tank reaches the predetermined level then the immersion unit turns off . Imagine the immersion as a kettle when the water boil , the kettle element turns off . The same thing happens here , so the actual figure is impossible to calculate so apologies ! <p> By turning it off which i did after i came across your article , you could just monitor your electricity usage and compare , and that 's how much you wasted . We simply halfed our electricity cost switching it off . 2 years in the dark tho omg <p> We have a house heated only by electric ( not storage heaters ) and a 150l unvented water tank heated by immersion heaters .

@@36748930 @5748930/ <h> Installing Cavity Wall Insulation <h> Insulation <h> What materials can you use for cavity wall insulation ? <p> There are two major types of cavity wall insulation : expanded polystyrene and wool . Properties typically used to be insulated with urea formaldehyde foam , but this is no longer used . <h> The installation process <p> Below , our friends at BillSaveUK show us how they install cavity wall insulation . <h> Expanded polystyrene ( EPS ) insulation <h> What is expanded polystyrene ( EPS ) ? <p> Commonly known as EPS , expandable polystyrene is a rigid , lightweight , foamed plastic product with excellent thermal insulation and impact resistant properties . EPS is produced when pentane , dissolved in small polystyrene beads , is made to expand under the influence of heat and steam . These foamed beads can be moulded into a wide range of shapes and sizes suitable for a wealth of applications . <p> No . EPS foam products have never been manufactured with CFCs . The expansion agent for EPS material is pentane . <h> What are CFCS ? - What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( CFCs ) are a family of chemical compounds used mainly as refrigerants for freezers , refrigerators and air-conditioning units and as industrial cleansing solvents primarily in the high-tech industry . CFCs are also used as an expansion agent in the manufacture of isocyanurate thermal insulation , some extruded polystyrene foam used for thermal insulation , and food service containers . <h> Are EPS products recyclable ? <p> EPS is 100 per cent recyclable and in the UK is currently being recycled at higher levels than either glass or aluminium . <p> Used polystyrene has no impact on the environment even in landfill sites or in incinerators , nor does it contain substances that could pollute the air or soil . Crucially , the manufacture of EPS solutions does not release hydrosoluable substances that could contaminate ground water supplies either . <h> Is EPS biodegradable ? <p> Although EPS foam does not biodegrade , it is benign to the environment and provides a stable fill material similar to earth , rock or concrete <h> How does EPS behave in the event of a fire ? <p> Like practically all organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its burning behaviour depends on the conditions under which it is used , as well as the inherent properties of the material . <p> These inherent properties differ depending on whether the cellular material is made from EPS with or without a fire retardant additive . The bonding of other materials to cellular polystyrene also considerably affects its burning behaviour . <p> When installed correctly , expanded polystyrene products do not present an increased fire hazard . It is strongly recommended that expanded polystyrene should always be protected by a facing material . <h> Wool insulation <p> Another option is wool insulation . Types include rock wool and mineral wool . Coarse fibres are blown into the cavity under pressure , and expand out to fill the space . <p> The advantage is that this form of insulation is fairly cheap and easy to install . It is the most common type and is often installed under the free insulation schemes as a result . <p> The downside is that it can only be used for standard and wide cavities , as it can become patchy in cavities of less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulation is often the reason behind many of the problems associated with this form of insulation . <h> Installing Cavity Wall Insulation to find you a local insulation installer , just fill in the form below and we will be in touch shortly ! <p> Interested in getting cavity wall insulation ? 184571 @qwx384571 184572 @qwx384572 <h> 3 comments <p> had to remove a brick from outer wall because of damp problem .. found piece of brick bridging the cavity .. removed this but polystyrene beads fell out .. before replacing removed brick can I replace beads in cavity ? <p> Hi P hopwood , that is unfortunately a common issue the cavity is often used as a bit of dumpling ground when the builders are laying the wall .

When beads are injected into the cavity , they are supposed to be injected with a glue that binds all the beads together . The fact is , many cavity wall installers look for shortcuts , and by just injecting in the beads without the glue , they save a lot of time more jobs can be done , they make more money . The issue is that problems only come to light when things like this happen ( a brick is removed ) . The first thing to do is try to get in touch with the company that installed the beads and ask to see the details of the products they allegedly used if it does mention glue ( as it should ) then they have not done the job properly and they should come and fix the works . <p> In terms of topping up the existing insulation , it should n't be a problem but it might be a good idea to remove what is there first and get it done properly .

@@36748932 @5748932/ <h> The Problem with Renewables and Intermittency <h> May 23 , 2014 <h> Renewable Energy sources &amp; their lack of predictability <p> We got an interesting email from one of our readers this morning , regarding Wind Power " glossing over the part where he said that we were the victim of brainwashing for thinking they do n't look that bad , the interesting part was regarding the intermittency aspect " i.e. wind turbines do n't produce any electricity when the wind is not blowing . <p> He citied this as a reason for wind turbines as being a bloody waste of time ' . <p> Intermittency is the big issue with many renewables , the inability to predict when they are going to produce electricity . Take solar for example , it produces no electricity at night and limited power when it is cloudy . Likewise wind does n't blow all the time for wind turbines and there are n't always waves available to drive wave turbines . <p> One of our favourite types of renewable here at TheGreenAge is tidal energy , which unlike almost all other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predicted accurately many years in advance so you should always be able to know when a tidal power plant will be producing energy . <h> Why is Intermittency of Renewables such an issue ? <p> The reason that intermittency is such an issue is that on the whole electricity usage in the UK is very predictable on a daily basis . On a very basic level , electricity demand is low from 11pm to 6am when people are in bed . Electricity demand then increases considerably as people wake up and go to work ; it stays fairly consistent throughout the day and then peaks when people return home at about 6-8pm and then it slowly drops off as the evening goes on . This pattern is the same in the summer and winter , although in winter electricity usage is higher . <p> So knowing that , not being able to predict when power is being produced makes things very tricky . At any one second , wind could be supplying 10% of our energy demand , but it can then all of a sudden drop which means other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What then is the future ? <p> As we continue to add more and more renewable power sources into our energy mix , the only logical answer will be energy storage . <h> Energy Storage needs to go hand in hand with Renewables <p> At the moment there is no clear winner on which energy storage method will become the norm . Personally , I like the idea of using excess electricity to split water via the process of hydrolysis into hydrogen and oxygen ( using solar you could use artificial photosynthesis instead of hydrolysis ) . The hydrogen then can be burnt to produce heat + water as a by-product , or better still it can be used in a fuel cell which is very efficient . <p> The nice thing about hydrogen is that it can be transported much like gas can at the moment . The US Department of Energy have even commissioned a study about the feasibility of feeding hydrogen directly into the natural gas pipelines , where it would displace some of the volume of gas , but still be perfectly usable . <p> Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are using wind power to supplement our gas supply , but in doing so , we would remove gas out of the equation " helping reduce our need to import gas from politically unstable overseas countries , as well as lowering the volume of green house gases produced . <p> So in answer to our reader and his email , we appreciate the frustrations people have over renewables , however when the energy storage technology side of things catches up , it will really unlock the potential of renewables and hopefully dramatically change peoples negative attitudes towards them . You can read more about some of the different types of energy storage in our Future section by clicking here . <h> 2 comments <p> The " no electricity when the wind does n't  blow " argument is n't quite as straight forward as it appears . We have a national grid and the wind is almost always blowing somewhere in the UK . Storage is expensive at the moment but there are many ways of doing it ( splitting hydrogen and oxygen from water and burning the hydrogen or using it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air to drive turbines to name but a couple ) These methods are expensive at the moment but they will become cheaper and perhaps our politicians will start to think that saving the planet is a better use of our money than bailing out bankers . <p> Ground source heat pumps are fairly constant ! ! I guess only on a smaller , individual scale . We are currently on holiday in France and everyone seems to have a form of renewable energy supplying their homes ? Perhaps their government is more Eco-friendly/supportive ? ! 
@@36748933 @5748933/ <p> We have previously written about building regulations not going far enough , but over the last 40 years they have actually improved considerably as you will see below ! <p> The first building regulations that had an impact on energy waste in the home came in to play in 1965 and these introduced limits on the amount of energy that could be lost through certain elements of the fabric of new houses . <p> Although building regulations are regularly updated , the iterations that really impacted the energy efficiency of homes were 1976 , 1985 , 1990 , 1995 , 2002 , 2006 and the latest in 2013 . In the article below we are going to show how building regs have changed for both walls and the roof ( i.e. loft space ) . Together , these make up the majority of the envelope of the property ( the envelope is made up of the roof , the walls + windows and the floor ) and accounts for the majority of heat loss from the property . <h> HISTORIC U-VALUES OF WALLS <p> The efficiency of walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties , the wall area represents the largest volume of the thermal envelope ( the outside of the property where heat loss occurs from ) therefore if you make that more efficient , it will have the largest impact on reducing energy bills and lowering energy demand . <p> The only real complication with the U-values of walls was that in 1976 building regulations defined walls as either exposed or semi-exposed . A semi-exposed wall is one that is exposed to the outside air via an unheated space , for example imagine a garage in the home , the wall between the garage and the main house would be a semi-exposed wall . <p> Anyway , below you can see how the u-value changed over time " remember that a smaller u-value shows a more energy efficient element , i.e. the movement of heat across the element takes longer . <p> 1965 the required u-value for walls was 1.7 <p> In 1976 as a result of the 1973 oil crisis , building regulations reduced the required u-value down to 1 ( but it remained 1.7 for semi-exposed walls ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls , hence many properties began to be insulated ( this is about the time we begin to see cavity wall insulation installed as standard ) . The required u-value for semi-exposed walls dropped too " down to 1.0 . <p> In 1990 the u-value for walls dropped down to 0.45 ; this meant that cavity walls were built with thicker cavities so more insulation could be installed . The required u-value for semi-exposed walls dropped down to 0.6 . <p> In 2002 , the u-value for walls was reduced to 0.35 and now building regulations stipulate the u-value for a wall should be just 0.3 , quite an improvement from 1.7 in 1965 ! <h> Historic U-Values of The Roof space <p> An uninsulated loft space would have a u-value in the region of 2.5 W/m2K , but in 1965 building regulations dictated that the maximum u-value for a loft should be 1.4 W/m2K " which could be achieved with just 2.8 cm of wool insulation ! <p> In 1973 , the required u-value dropped to 0.6 " this required a 7cm thick layer of wool insulation " again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1985 , the u-value dropped to 0.35 , in 1990 it dropped to 0.25 and in 2002 this dropped down to 0.2 . To achieve a u-value of 0.2 , you would require 20cm of mineral wool insulation . <p> Nowadays the u-value required for roofs ( and loft insulation ) is 0.17 W/m2K " this is 250mm of wool insulation " so in effect you now need 10 times as much insulation as 50 years ago to ensure you conform " that is quite a lot more ! 
@@36748934 @5748934/ <h> Feed-in Tariff <h> Financial Incentives <h> What is the Feed-in Tariff ? <p> The Feed-in Tariff ( FiT ) is a government subsidy scheme launched following the Energy Act 2008 , to allow growth in electricity generation from green microgeneration technologies , ( which- if unsubsidised are otherwise more expensive than the current solutions ) . The UK Feed-in Tariff model closely mimics the German StrEG FiT scheme of the 1990s which encourages household and industry microgeneration of electricity using renewable technologies . To be eligible for feed-in tariff payments in the UK , installations need to have a declared net capacity of 5MW or less . In the past , installations with a declared net capacity of between 50kW and 5MW made the one-off choice of whether to use the FiT or the renewable obligation scheme . This has now closed to new applications . <p> The following low-carbon , renewable technologies are eligible for Feed-in Tariff payments : <h> How do feed-in tariffs work ? <p> The FiT scheme provides a subsidy to any household or businesses that generates its own renewable electricity . This payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills . Payments are based on your meter readings and paid by your energy supplier . The subsidy is an enabler for small scale renewable and low-carbon technologies to compete against the traditional fossil fuel forms of electricity generation . In the case of solar PV , wind power and Micro-CHP , to be eligible under the FiT scheme , - your installer needs to be registered under the Microgeneration Certification Scheme ( MCS ) , and the product installed also needs to be MCS certified . If you are installing hydroelectric or anaerobic digestion you will need to apply for ROO-FIT- accreditation . <p> The tariff payments depend when you get the renewable- technology- installed and , in the case of solar PV , the payment amount is also dependant on the EPC rating of the home where the installation is due to take place . Payments are guaranteed for a period of 20 years and 10 years for micro CHP . Once you register at a point in time , the subsidy will be available to you for the duration of that time . <p> Until 2015 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for themselves within as little as a couple of years , and any payments claimed after that were profit. - This is no longer the case , as rates have dropped considerably. - Payments may be index linked , so from time to time they are adjusted to the RPI , and are regularly reviewed by the Government . There are three parts of the Feed-in Tariff to consider : <h> The Generation Tariff <p> A payment made for every kWh of electricity produced , regardless of whether this is sold back to the grid or used in the home and this payment is guaranteed for 20 years . A generation meter determines the amount of electricity you produce and each quarter you give this reading to your energy supplier who will then send you a cheque through the post . This payment is- guaranteed- for 20 years ( except micro CHP , which is only guaranteed for 10 years ) . <p> For commercial Solar PV systems , there are 3 different generation tariff rates depending on the circumstances of the system . Most businesses will get the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of system ) . If however , the system provides power to a building with an EPC E ' rating or lower , you will receive what is called the lower ' generation tariff rate . <p> A Medium Rate ' at 90% of the higher rate is payable where the owner has 25 feed in Tariff registered solar systems or more . <h> The Export Tariff <p> The export tariff is payment made to you for every kWh of electricity exported back to the grid . <p> Unfortunately , ( for now at least ) the UKs National Grid does not have the technology to store energy- , so needs to be used as it is produced ; therefore if you are not in the property when the electricity is being produced it will automatically be exported back to the grid . In some instances properties have an export meter attached to their renewable installation , so an accurate assessment can be made with regards to the amount of electricity exported ; however normally there is no export meter and it is- assumed- you export half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case or not ! <p> This can work in your favour if you are using more electricity in your home than you are exporting to the grid , however if you are going to be exporting more than 50% back to the grid it is imperative you do install the export meter for more details on why this is the case please visit here . <h> Saving on electricity bills <p> Every kWh of electricity that you create yourself and then use in your home means that you do n't  need to buy that unit from the electricity company . Electricity is currently priced at about 15 pence/kWh when you buy it from any of the big six energy companies , so the more electricity you produce and use in your home , the more you save . <h> Feed-in tariff registration <p> In practice in the UK , the big six energy companies ( British Gas , EoN , SSE , Scottish Power , EDF and NPower ) are required by law to provide the FiT payments to homes and businesses . Other smaller electricity suppliers may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so . The full list of registered FiT licensed suppliers is available on the OFGEM website here . <p> Once you have the product installed through the MCS , you should receive a certificate confirming MCS compliance . Speak to your energy company ( e.g. one of the big 6 ) that is approved for FiT payments " express your interest in receiving FiT payments . Your supplier will confirm your eligibility , cross checking your details to the MCS database . On confirmation of FiT payments your details will also be added to the OFGEM Central FiT Register . <p> You may also need to agree a process for meter reading and whether you want to opt out from export tariffs . An important point to note is that it is far more economical to use as much of the electricity you produce in the home as you can , rather than selling it back to the grid . Using a kWh of the electricity you produce in your home saves you buying it from the energy suppliers at 15p , while you can only sell it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FiT varies for different technologies <h> The Generation Tariff <p> This tariff is paid on the total amount of energy generated by the renewable energy source . The rate depends on the technology and the size of the system . You can find the latest rates for each technology- here . These- have been set provisionally until 2019 , and are steadily dropping . Here are the current rates ( 1 April 30 June 2017 ) for the smallest eligible capacity- of each technology : <p> Anaerobic digestion capacity of 250kW or less 5.99 per kWh <p> Hydroelectric capacity of 100kW or less 7.61p per kWh <p> Solar PV capacity of 10kW or less 4.04p per kWh <p> Micro CHP capacity of 2kW or less 13.45p per kWh <p> Wind capacity of 50kW or less 8.19p per kWh <h> The Export Tariff <p> These are additional payments for every kWh of surplus electricity generated and exported back to the grid . When the electricity is sold back to the energy company , this can be then sold back again to another customer . The export tariffs is fixed and currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount is index linked and is periodically adjusted for inflation . <h> Deployment caps <p> In January 2015 , there were some big changes to the FiT . As well as a general drop in rates , caps were also introduced to limit the overall amount that could be claimed for each technology. - Essentially , these mean that once a certain number of payments have been claimed within the quarter , rates for remaining claimants will drop . Therefore , you can expect to receive comparatively- less money than in previous years . 
@@36748935 @5748935/ <h> CHP Cogeneration A Comparison of UK to Sweden <h> Introduction to combined heat and power <p> Combined heat and- power ( CHP ) is not a new idea to the UK . Sheffield for example , has a large district heating network which makes considerable carbon savings and the- Immingham plant- on the Humber is a large industrial example . Yet when one compares the UK to Sweden , UK CHP seems very underdeveloped in comparison . Here I would like to discuss just what makes Swedish CHP so great and what the future holds in the UK for the technology . <p> I wo n't go into lots of detail on the technical aspects to CHP cogeneration . You can find that on our main technology page- here . The principle is simple however ; whether on a micro scale or on an industrial scale , power production and industrial processes create a lot of heat , which is effectively wasted energy . CHP cogeneration aims to take this waste heat and make it useful , increasing the efficiency of the installation . Often this will mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic or industrial heating . <h> Example of Sweden " wide adoption of combined heat and power technology <p> For the best examples of these ideals , Sweden is an excellent place to look . Here , around two thirds of heating requirements are provided through renewables in the form of- biofuels , waste materials and sustainably sourced electricity . Additionally , district heating is widely implemented there , and now accounts for 43% of heating consumption. - Biomass- is considerably more common generally , which makes an excellent low carbon combination with district heating . But what is special about the country to make these technologies so much more widely implemented however ? <p> Perhaps most importantly , the Nordics have long taken on board the need for action on climate change , and as a result have policies considerably more proactive for carbon reduction than the UK . For example , coal burning is extremely expensive due to the huge taxes levied on power stations burning the fossil fuel " the tax can be as much as twice the cost of the coal . The knock on effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity production . In some instances this has meant more biofuels , but also- geothermal- and other renewables are found . Both of these technologies lend themselves well to CHP , due to the large quantities of heat they generate . <p> This is not simply a coincidence however . The region has extremely cold winters , and heating is therefore much more important than in milder climes . As a result , many power stations of this type are thermal leading ' , meaning their main purpose is to provide heat rather than electricity . Electricity is more the by-product than heating in some instances . <h> What does this mean for the UK ? <p> So are the UK and Sweden similar enough to be able to learn from their example , or are the two so different as to make the comparison irrelevant ? <p> Even though we are a milder country , the UK spends around -33 billion on heat across the economy per year and it is the number one reason for energy use . It therefore follows that reducing our heating 's contribution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , a multifaceted approach to reducing this burden is important . Insulation and energy efficiency are imperative , yet CHP cogeneration could offer a way to tackle this problem at the source . Immingham ConocoPhillips refinery is the largest industrial CHP facilities in Europe , located in the north-east of the UK . Sheffield on the other hand , is a good example of district heating , where its waste to energy plant converts hundreds of thousands of tonnes of waste each year into heat and energy . Running for nearly 25 years , the plant saves around 20,000 tonnes of carbon emissions per year when compared to fossil fuels . The scheme supplies electricity to the grid and helps heat hundreds of the city 's major buildings . <p> Sheffield is a great example of CHP working well in an urban environment , yet after a quarter of a century of successful operation , the UK has yet to fully embrace the advantages of CHP as a tool for efficiency and carbon savings . <p> The- DECC- last spring released their Heat Strategy ' , which has highlighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for a change in Britain 's attitude to heat , looking at both supply and demand to reduce energy consumption . On the demand side it proposes 3 major areas for improvement : insulation , efficiency of heat delivery systems and better heat management . On the supply side , the main areas of focus are : low carbon building level heating systems , changing the content of natural gas in the grid and low carbon heat networks . It also specifically mentions the EU market for- heat pumps- and how the UK can capitalise on this . <h> So is more UK CHP just around the corner ? <p> Looking at some of the prerequisites for CHP , the UK seems to fulfil them all ; the fuel source is there , the technology is already available , the dense urban environments of major cities in the UK lend themselves perfectly to district heating and given the urgent need to new energy solutions , there seems to be an obvious gap in the market for more CHP . Perhaps it is just a cultural barrier that remains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK is only now waking up to the fact is needs to rethink its energy and heating policies . 
@@36748936 @5748936/ <h> What is clean coal ? <p> The UK Government has n't specifically made clean coal one of the solutions that will help achieve 2020 emissions targets and beyond rather clean coal is one of the possible projects that is linked to- Carbon Capture &amp; Storage- ( CCS ) initiatives that are currently in the pipeline . More about public policy later . <p> The clean coal process seeks to reduce harsh environmental effects by using multiple technologies to clean coal and contain its emissions . For example now CCS involves capturing the carbon dioxide , preventing the greenhouse gas entering the atmosphere or the coal can be cleaned before it is burned . However many of the approaches are yet to be made available on a large commercial scale because of the costs involved . This section focuses specifically on clean coal but there are other solutionsCCS and washing coal , for example , are one of the solutions . <h> Current conventional coal technology <p> The combustion and the subsequent emissions from conventional coal fire power stations is one least environmentally free ways to generate electricity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to global warming , create acid rain and pollute water . For example burning coal emits the following : sulphur- dioxide ( acid rain ) ; nitrogen oxides ( ground-level ozone ) and particulates ( affects people 's respiratory systems ) . Although- Nuclear Power- can have devastating effects if things go wrong at- the power station or if toxic waste is not properly disposed off ( very low probability ) , the emitting process does n't have the impact on the environment that coal burning has . <h> Clean coal technologies available <p> The best- known technology which seeks to capture and store the CO2- away from the power plant that has created it . There are several ways the CO2- can be stored and are either geologic or oceanic solutions . An example of geologic , is where the CO2- can be pumped into disused coal fields . This then displaces the methane which can be used as fuel for other purposes . CO2- can be pumped into and stored into saline aquifer . Finally CO2- can be pumped into oil fields , helping maintain the pressure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a technology that is still in its infancy and involves injecting liquid CO2- into water which is between 500 to 3,000 meters deep . The expectation is that the CO2- would dissolves under pressure . The snag to this process is that it may impact the pH of the water and therefore harm marine habitats . <p> Coal Washing <p> When coal burns , it releases carbon dioxide and other emissions in flue gas . This is most prominent when seeing large plumes of smoke coming out of the power station chimneys . The Coal Washing process looks to clean the material and purify it before it burns . This type of coal preparation removes unwanted minerals by mixing crushed coal with a liquid and allowing the impurities to separate and settle . <p> Scrubbers <p> Another system , looks to control the coal burn to minimize emissions of sulphur dioxide , nitrogen oxides and other trace greenhouse gases . Wet scrubbers , or flue gas desulphurisation systems , remove sulphur dioxide , a major cause of acid rain , by spraying flue gas with limestone and water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gypsum , a component of drywall . <p> Low Burners <p> Low Nitrogen oxide burners reduce the creation of nitrogen oxides , by restricting the amount of oxygen available in the hottest part of the combustion chamber where the coal is burned . This minimises the formation of the gas and requires less post-combustion treatment . <p> Electrostatic Precipitators <p> Electrostatic precipitators remove more than 99% of the particulates from the flue gas . The system operates by charging particles with an electrical field and then capturing them on collection plates . These particulates if not removed aggravate asthma and cause respiratory ailments . <p> Gasification <p> The process of gasification avoids burning coal altogether . With integrated gasification combined cycle ( IGCC ) systems , steam and hot pressurised air or oxygen combine with coal in a reaction that forces carbon molecules apart . This results in the creation of syngas which is a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen ( primary ) . These substances are then cleaned and burned in a gas turbine to make electricity . The heat energy from the gas turbine also powers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create two forms of energy , which means they have the potential to have much higher levels of fuel efficiency . According to- US Dept. of Energy , this level of efficiency is as high as 50% . <h> Future development of the industry <p> Coal is still the most cost effective fuel for electricity production as the alternative forms can not replace a power source this cheap and plentiful in supply . Therefore clean coal technology offers an opportunity to mitigate the increasingly severe climactic effects -of coal emissions with some of the process explored in the previous sections . The- Vattenfall-Schwarze Pumpe- plant in- Germany- is a common example of a power plant that uses carbon capture technology . <p> However as some of the technologies are not yet commercially viable , clean coal is still in development to be part of the zero-emissions ' solution . For example Utilities in the- UK- will not always trade-off more technology to help the environment versus the technology that is commercially viable .

At the moment there are six projects in that have cleared the- European Investment Bank- financing hurdles and are up for being able to receive some of the G5bn- Carbon Credits- available to support a max of eight European projects in total . In addition to that , the DECC has now pledged a further -1bn of funding support to help get the first project up and operational . <p> Cleaning coal and storing its emissions significantly increases the cost of producing a Kw/h of electricity for an otherwise cheap fuel .

Look down at ground level and look up about 6 inches or so up the wall . Somewhere around here you will see a thin black line of either slate or plastic running horizontally across the brick work . This is your DPC . Sometime this is going to be tricky to spot , as the DPC might have worn into the wall in the case of plastic , or painted , rendered etc . <h> What if you do n't have a DPC ? <p> The majority of homes will have DPCs , especially any built in the last 100 years .

This will be for the cost of materials and a days labour on site . The price will vary with the length of the wall to be injected and the system that is being installed .

@@36748938 @5748938/ <h> What is Liquid Air Energy Storage ? <p> Liquid Air Energy Storage ( LAES ) is a form of storing excess energy just as- CAES- ( Compressed Air Energy Storage ) or other battery storage systems . The system is based on separating carbon dioxide and water vapour from the air to produce a higher concentration of nitrogen . This nitrogen can then be liquefied for storage and expanded back to a gas when we need to make electricity . Liquid nitrogen is a commonly used substance in current industrial processes and can be stored and transported in large volumes at atmospheric pressure . This is different to the- CAES- process , which requires high-pressure storage chambers . Liquid nitrogen is also a good substance because it has a high expansion rate . In fact , it expands 700 times in volume when turning back into a gas from a liquid . <p> The LAES form of storage works well with intermittent power sources like wind and solar power , because the additional electricity created can be used to help filter the air into nitrogen , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreated when the liquid is expanded to turn into its gas form . <h> How does the Liquid Air Storage process actually work ? <p> The process depends on using liquefied air or liquid nitrogen ( 78% of air ) , which can be stored in large volumes at atmospheric pressure . The air is taken through an inlet and then into a compressor . On entering the compressor air is made up of a percentage of oxygen , water vapour , carbon dioxide and mostly nitrogen . When too much electricity is generated , the excess electricity is used to power the compressor and the chilling unit . Here the nitrogen component is separated and further cooled so it forms into a liquid , at precisely -196-C . The liquid nitrogen is then stored in a chilled vacuum until it is needed to drive power recovery . If there is a peak in demand or if the grid is struggling to meet demand , the liquid nitrogen can help with this . Then first step is to transfer the liquid into an ambient temperature chamber , usually into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any small change to ambient temperature will superheat it . This creates expansion as the liquid once again becomes a gas . The expanding steam then drives a turbine ( cryogenic engine ) , which drives the standard electric generator . Upon creating the electricity , it can then be reconnected and integrated back into the grid . <h> Can Liquid Air Storage energy be a commercially viable solution ? <p> According to the- Institute for Mechanical Engineers ( IMechE ) , the process is anywhere between 25% and 70% efficient . This means that up to 70% of the electricity can be recreated from the cryogenic air compression process explained above . The process becomes more efficient if the cryogenic chambers , air vacuums and generator are located near a factory or an existing power station . This is because excess heat is usually vented , but it can be used efficiently in the LAES process . However despite a possible 70% efficiency , it is worth noting that batteries have an efficiency of 80% . Therefore , to be commercially viable , a cryogenic LAES plant needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cryogenic LAES plant should also be located close to an intermittent renewable source of energy such as- solar PV , - wind power- or- marine energy , so that it can minimise the electricity and heat loss during the transmission process . <p> The main challenge we all have is how to deal with erratic demand for electricity and somewhat intermittent supply from non-traditional sources like wind , solar and marine energy . One of the answers could be to use a solution like LEAS to store energy when it is plentiful and then use the storage to convert it back to electricity to meet demand . Therefore current power grids need to be upgraded so they are able to work smarter in order that energy can be provided when it is needed . Many argue that wind , solar and marine energy generation are tied to local environmental conditions , and there is no point transporting this energy around the country via the grid because much of it is lost through the transformation process . Therefore having LAES solutions sitting alongside more responsive local grids is something that should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already inefficient national grid . <h> How does Liquid Air Storage compare to Compressed Air Energy Storage ? <p> The energy density of cryogenically frozen fluids , such as liquid nitrogen compares very well against current alternatives such as- compressed air , mainly because it can be used and transported under atmospheric pressure . Compressed air needs to be stored in special pressurised tanks , which are liable to leaks . Also compressed air requires special storage space underground , like mining shafts , which are limited in availability . <h> Liquid Air Energy Storage and the UK <p> Cooling air using a cryogenic process to create liquid nitrogen is not new , but the current efficiency levels are low because of the energy required to produce the storage fuel , and then again to create electricity . Highview Power in Buckinghamshire operate a heat recover and energy storage system with this process at 25% efficiency . They could increase this efficiency to 70% if they were located next to a conventional power station where excess heat could be recycled .

For many people without a gas supply , electricity is their only option , but have you tried to see how much a new gas connection would cost ? Is it financially viable for your home ? <h> How much does a gas supply cost ? <p> This really does vary depending on your property , but there are a few important things that you need to consider which will contribute significantly towards the cost of the connection : <p> Has the property had gas in the past and been disconnected ? If so , it is often fairly simple to reconnect you and the cost is likely to be a few hundred pounds . <p> How close is the nearest gas line ? If your neighbours or others on the street have gas , then chances are that there is a gas supply right on your doorstep and it just needs a pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this instance should be under a thousand pounds . <p> Are you in a rural part of the country ? If you are outside towns or cities it is quite likely that a gas supply quite hard to obtain to your property . In this case costs could spiral into -1000s just to get connected , making it quite an expensive option . <p> Are you in a flat above the ground floor ? Flats tend to have complications as the pipe will need to run through other people 's property . High rise properties also suffer with issues of gas pressure . These types of properties tend to cost thousands of pounds to connect . <p> The National Grid ( one of the Gas Distribution Network companies ) give a list of the various prerequisites that need to be met for what they call a standard charge ' installation . You can find them in the- connection document here. - If your property meets all of those criteria , chances are the cost of your gas line will be in the order of hundreds rather than thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To supply gas to a property it must first be connected to the gas grid . If the property is not connected to a gas grid then a Gas Distribution Network- ( GDN or GT ) company can provide a connection from the nearest supply to the gas meter of your property . <p> It is the responsibility- of GDNs- companies such as National Grid , Northern Gas Networks , Southern Gas Networks and Wales &amp; West Utilities to maintain these networks and also offer options for new customers to connect should they wish to . To find out which GT can supply your property with a new connection please visit the following OFGEM document by clicking here . <p> You can speak to your gas supply company ( retailer ) such as British Gas , E.ON , SSE , EDF , etc in the first instance on what is the best way to proceed with getting connected to the gas grid . The gas supplier will in most cases advise for you to get a quote from the GDN , an Independent Gas Transporter ( IGT ) or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to connect to a gas supply <p> To ensure- the market is as competitive as possible , OFGEM have designed a framework that also allows other organisations such as IGTs and UIPs to also provide this connection service in certain instances . <p> Utility Infrastructure providers tend to procure for connections to the gas grid on new housing developments or new commercial premises . However according to the OFGEM guidelines you can ask one of these companies to procure a connection to your property . <h> Infills <p> For example , if you live in a- community where there are a number of existing properties- that do not have a connection to a gas supply , then the term infills is usually applied to the gas connection project . These are often remote communities- situated some distance from a relevant gas main . <p> If a number of local residents gather together and request that an infill project is undertaken , the GT- will determine the connection charge at the beginning of the scheme and apply a similar- charge to all requests for a connection to the main for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are provided for under the Gas ( Connection Charges ) - Regulations , see here for more details . <p> Therefore if you have recently moved into a remote community and the neighbours are connected to the gas network but your property is- not , then according to the regulations , as long as you find out what the infill project rates were , then those same rates can be applied to connect your property even if the original project was nearly 20 years ago . This could therefore save you quite a lot of money . <h> Is it worth getting a gas supply ? <p> If you have an idea of the cost , you need to decide if it is going to be worth it long term . Obviously in the short term the cost is going to be significant , as not only will you need to pay for a gas connection , you also will need to pay for the installation of a boiler , radiators and pipework . This- involves installing pipework from the meter to the boiler and additional pipework to provide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an idea of the savings involved , you can take a look at your EPC or Green Deal Report and check the savings that are suggested by switching to gas heating .

This cost can range from a modest heating system in a ground floor flat starting around -4,000 , to a 4 bed semi for as much as -8,000 . <p> As you can see , the big up-front cost wo n't pay back over night , but a 10-15 year payback is actually pretty good when you compare with other money saving improvements like double glazing .

@@36748941 @5748941/ <h> Adding additional solar panels to an existing system <h> October 12 , 2015 <p> With the proposed reduction to the solar feed-in tariff , we are getting a huge amount of interest from people looking to install their new solar panels before the 1st January ( the date that the proposed cuts would take place ) . <p> We are also getting a fair bit of interest from households that already have solar arrays who want to add additional solar panels to their existing systems . This is 100% feasible but there are a few things to bear in mind . <h> The Feed-in Tariff <p> Firstly the feed-in tariff you will be paid for the new panels will be today 's rate " not the rate you got when your first installed panels on your roof . That means that if you installed your panels at the end of 2011 and benefited from the 43p feed in tariff , the return from your new additional panels is not going to be anywhere near as big " the feed in tariff today is 12.47p / kWh , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third of what it was . Having said that the panels will be much cheaper to install ! <h> G83 &amp; G59 Solar applications <p> The second thing to bear in mind is the size of the system . <p> Systems under 3.68kW are deemed small scale and can be installed and connected to the grid straight away . The system then needs to be registered by submitting a G83 form to the Distribution Network Operator ( DNO ) after the install ( your solar installer will normally do this ) . <p> The reason for the 3.68kW is because there is a 16 Amps per phase limit so 16A multiplied by 230v ( mains voltage ) = 3.68kW . <p> If you decide to install a system larger than 3.68kW , then you need to make a G59 application to the DNO " this is a legal requirement " they will decide whether this size system will operate within the existing grid framework i.e. an acceptable load will be exported on the grid . In most cases this application will be approved provided the proposed system is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks from start to finish , so it may delay the install . <p> The good news is that inverters are limited to 16 Amps , so in reality a 4kW system can be installed without the need to go through the G59 process , however if you are planning to install additional panels which will take your total installed capacity above the 4kW threshold ( so 16 x 250w panels ) , you will need to go through the G59 process . <h> The size of the existing panels determine the size of the new panels <p> Another thing to bear in mind is the size of the new solar panels that are being proposed . Remember in a solar array , each panel ( if they system has one central inverter ) will be operating at the efficiency of the worst performing panel . Likewise if you existing panels are 200w and you are going to add panels and still run them through the same inverter , then you should buy 200w panels ( ideally the same make and model ) . If you bought 300w panels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be cheaper to go this route . <h> You may require a new inverter <p> When a system is installed the inverter will be sized accordingly , it is normally sized to about 80-120% of the total load . Therefore it might not be possible to add additional panels into your existing array and keep your inverter . To be honest , depending when the inverter was installed it may be better to get a new one that will be able to cope with the additional load going through it . i.e. if the size of your system goes from 3kW to 5.5kW , then you might want to install a new 6kW inverter especially if it comes with a 10 year warranty . The other option is simply to install a completely separate inverter for your new solar panels " although this may be more expensive in the long run when it comes to the time you need to replace them . <h> Make sure it is worth it ! <p> The most important thing is to run the numbers " adding one panel will not really be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure you get the financial return from the additional panels ( in terms of energy savings and Feed-in tariff payments ) . This means you are going to need a fairly decent amount of space on the roof . It is also worth checking the structural integrity of your existing roof before adding any additional solar panels to your roof . While the roof might be absolutely fine with the existing array , additional solar panels might be too heavy for the roof to withstand , so make sure this is considered before making the investment . <h> 3 comments <p> I have a 3.5 kw system on my SW facing roof and receive the maximum tariff . We are planning an extension which means adding a gable to the middle of the roof and several panels will need to be re positioned . Will this affect our current tariff ? How will the inverter be affected ? Who do I ask for help on this matter as my installer no longer operates . Many thanks . <p> I have a secondary and continuous flat roof over my front-door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my house approximately 18 ft . Is it allowable to have a second array of solar panels installed at the appropriate angle to increase my solar footprint . This , I estimate would be about a third of the present 4KWh.

Has Boris Johnson been inert on environmental policy because we have let him ? Are environmental policies as much of a priority as we 'd like to think ? Issues , like crime , tax , hospitals , transport and schools are all seen as more important . Given this , is it any wonder that environmental issues are not top of the agenda ?

Take a 600-Watt panel for example : this will heat an area of approximately 12m2 in an average property . <p> Having said that , there are other variables that also have a part to play in the heating ability of an infrared heating panels . These include the quality of existing insulation , the temperature of the outside environment and the temperature that the household tends to set their thermostat . <h> Thermal envelope of the property and infrared heating panels <p> The level of insulation , the quality of glazing and the air-tightness of a building are key factors in determining how much heat is retained . Each building fabric will offer a different thermal insulating performance , but this must be taken into consideration when you are sizing panels . <p> If you have good quality insulation for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , warming the room quickly , then modulating on and off to top-up the heat as required . Obviously the better insulated the walls and the roof space , the more heat will be retained and the less the panels will need to work . <p> If , on the other hand , you live in a period property and you have solid walls ; or if you live in house with unfilled cavities , then installing insulation prior to putting up the heating panels may be a sensible idea . Loft insulation , for example , is cheap and easy to install . Ideally this should be be done prior to installing the panels , since once in place , the insulation would help limit the heat loss from the home when the panels were switched on . <h> How infrared heaters- work <p> Infrared heating panels work by emitting infrared radiation ; this is then absorbed by an object , which in turn will then warm up . The residents should be able a comfortable level of warmth , even though the air temperature may be lower than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( that relies on convection heating ) . <p> If the heating panel is positioned on the wall , a certain amount of the infrared radiation will be aimed at the ceiling and will get absorbed . As a result , this energy will not be felt directly by any people in the room . Therefore , based on our calculations , positioning heating panels on the walls may limit the heating area by as much as 20% . <p> In an ideal world , the panels would be positioned on the ceiling ; however this is slightly dependant on whether the plasterboard is able to support that weight from the panels . If in doubt , seek advice from a construction expert prior to installation . <p> It is important to touch on shading when talking about infrared heating ; if the radiation is absorbed by something before it reaches the intended target , then the target sadly wo n't get warm . This is very similar going from direct sunlight into shade you will suddenly feel colder . This is because the sun does the bulk of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different to UV rays ) . The same thing happens in the home ; if a table absorbs the infrared , the floor underneath it will not warm up . <p> To achieve a more all-round warm feeling , similar to what you would experience with a traditional central heating system , the heating panel needs time to warm the walls and furniture . These then give off warmth and effectively act as secondary heaters. - Solid stone or brick walls take time to heat up but then give off warmth nicely . <h> Infrared heaters reduce condensation <p> Cold walls tend to cool the warm air created by conventional central heating and can cause condensation , whereas infrared heating is designed to heat the walls and the contents of the room . The fact the walls are heated and mean they will stay dry , reducing condensation and the helping prevent the buildup of mould . <h> How much heating output does my home require ? <p> The sizing information we give- is based upon a fairly well-constructed and relatively well-insulated home . So as a result we assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be more like 100 or even 150 watts per m2 for an uninsulated house or a commercial premises . The customer should always do some- background research and assess how well insulated and thermally efficient their property is . <p> The other element to factor in is the temperature the homeowner would like to heat their property to . A- recommended- ambient temperature is normally between 18 and 22oC ; however if you like to heat your home at 30oC- then you will require more watts per m2- and this will obviously cost you more to do . <p> A room thermostat and programmer may also help you take control of the heating . By fitting a room programmer , you can judge the warmup period and cool-down time needed and also set a lower daytime temperature just to prevent the room becoming too cold . A thermostat will help prevent wasting electricity by turning the heater on and off to maintain a set temperature , which is especially useful in spring and autumn when the weather is changeable and also in winter to keep a general warmth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then having to use lots of power to boost the warmth up . Most compatible programmers cost between -50 to -100 and can be set with a number of different times- and temperatures throughout the day . Some go a little bit further than that and can even be set remotely using phone apps and the internet . <p> If you do decide to hang the infrared panels on the wall , you also need to consider where on the wall you are going to hang them . Infrared rays travel about 3 metres out of the panel , so a central position on the longest wall is preferable . Positioning at one end of the room and leaving areas unreachable will unfortunately produce cold spots , so you may wish to consider two panels if this is the case . <h> From -189.99 <p> It is also important to note that infrared will travel through glass so heaters should not be positioned facing a window . This is probably more important in smaller rooms . Also there should not be any items of furniture in front of the heater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . <p> Hopefully this gives you better insight into how infrared heating works and therefore you will be able to install your infrared heaters in the most effective way . <h> Questions to ask yourself before installing an infrared heating panel <p> Q : What is the area/room size you are trying to heat ? <p> A : The bigger the room , the more heating output you will require to get it up to comfortable temperature . <p> Q : What is the construction of the room/house " is it an old stone building , a modern building ? Assess the level of existing insulation . <p> A : Older , solid wall properties will be less insulated , which means the rays are absorbed more by the fabric of the building ; which in turn means less useful heat will radiate back into the room . So you may require more watts per m2 . <p> Q : How many walls are external ? <p> A : The more external walls that the heated area is exposed to , the more likely that heat will escape and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important , so determining how well the walls are insulated will have an impact on- the heating requirement per m2 . The better the insulation ( filled cavity or solid wall insulation ) , the more likely the heat will remain in the room/s and keep that useful warmth , so the panels need to work less hard . <p> Q : What type of glazing do you have ? Is it single or double and what is the size that occupies the walls ? <p> A : If the answer is single glazing and the amount of area is large , then you will require higher output wattage than the 50 watts per m2 that we recommend . <p> Q : What height is the ceiling ? <p> A : Domestic panels work optimally up to 3m in room height . If you have higher ceilings you can contact us and we will give you- further guidance . <p> Q : Where do you think you will be placing the panels ceiling or walls ? <p> A : If you place the panels on the walls , ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of the bigger panels will require a bigger gap of at least 2metres .

@@36748945 @5748945/ <h> Cavity walls and the benefits of insulating them <h> August 11 , 2013 <p> Cavity wall insulation has been around for years , and it remains one of the best ways to help reduce your energy bills . So we at TheGreenAge thought that we should give you a quick guide on what you need to know so that you can maximise energy efficiency of your home . See the video below for a quick introduction ! <h> How do you know if you have cavity walls ? <p> When we do our Green Deal Assessments with clients in London , we stress the importance of insulating the envelope of the property , which includes the roof , the walls and the floor . The first thing we do therefore is check whether the home has cavity or solid walls . There are several simple ways to check this. - <h> Understanding the property age <p> Generally speaking , properties built after 1930 will have cavity walls . Those built prior will have a solid brick walls . But that is n't definitive as we encounter many semi-detached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , St Albans , Ealing and so forth ) that actually have solid walls , despite their age ! <h> Checking the brickwork <p> Check your brickwork . If you have bricks end to end across the whole wall , it is a cavity wall ( also called a stretched bond see diagram below ) . If the bricks are a mixture of stretchers ' and headers ' where there are short bricks and long looking bricks , then you have a solid wall ( i.e. no cavity ) . <h> Measuring the wall thickness <p> Sometimes walls are rendered , which makes things a little more tricky since you ca n't see the pattern of the bricks . If this is the case , you can try measuring the thickness of the wall through a window or doorway . If it is less than 260mm , it is likely a solid wall . Anything thicker is more likely to be a cavity . <p> Other ways to check is by looking at un-plastered areas of the house ( in the staircase , airing cupboards or in the loft ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a layer of brick . <h> Checking for existing cavity wall insulation <p> So you have a good idea of whether you have a cavity or not . The next step is to check whether it has been insulated . Modern properties built from the 1980 's onward are generally insulated when they are built , since it is now part of standard building regulations . Homes built prior to this date may or may not have insulation . If it was insulated it after construction date it would have been done so by injecting insulation into the cavity through holes in the wall . You can usually spot where these holes have been covered up on a brick wall along the mortar lines . <p> So what if you still ca n't tell ? In this case it is time to call in a professional to come to your property and inspect the potential cavity . <p> When a professional energy assessor ( like one from our team ) comes round to your property they will undertake a borescopic examination . This involves drilling a small , non-intrusive hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checking with a borescope ( a camera on the end of a fibreoptic cable ) for any insulation . We show you how this is done in the video below : <h> What could Cavity Wall Insulation do for me ? <p> So you know you need insulation , what is it worth exactly ? Typically cavity wall insulation costs around -500-1,000 , depending on the size of the property and the walls needing to be insulated . <p> But it can save you serious money on your heating .

My devices automatically power on prior to the times when I normally use them and switch off for the duration of time when I do n't  use them . For example my TV has no power from 3am in the morning until just before I return from work the next night . This means that when I return home the TV is in standby for me to use without noticing that it just spent the day completely powered off . Each device is switched by a socket which draws 0.6W . Devices can be timer controlled , manually switched or controlled via an app over the internet if required . <p> With this I have reduced parasitic in the house to a continual 80Watts from 320Watts .

Save that power and try something more ethical and with the money- give it to a charity . if you 're on a PAYE income you can increase this amount of money by letting the charity claim the tax you paid . Drug dealers would n't be on PAYE unless they also have a legal job , but they can still save that money and donate to their favourite charity ( drug rehab ? ) . <p> There a few points here 1 ) When he TV is on so that does not contribute to the standby time .

They said it can cause the battery to Bloatit makes it bulge in the centre which has happened to my s4 and i never leave it anymore . <p> So there are two things to consider here Phil , firstly if a phone is n't connected to the charger , a very small amount of current will still be pulled by the charger barely noticeable , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ( and this is the case with newer phones , but I am sure older phones charge differently ! ) , then once the battery is fully charged , the charger will stop giving it power .

The best way of seeing the impact of a phone charger is using an energy monitor this will show you in real terms how much electricity you are using in different scenarios . <p> When you make this comment , " Likewise for things like charging mobile phones , if you charge it overnight , it will be fully charged after 2 hours , and then for the rest of the evening it is using electricity unnecessarily , so charge it during the day then you can turn off the charger when it is done ( or even better charge it at work " Are you saying that when the phone is fully charged , the charger keeps " working " ?

@@36748947 @5748947/ <h> Immingham Combined Heat and Power <h> Background to the- Immingham CHP Power Plant <p> Combined heat and power- technology works well with many existing industrial processes and- Immingham CHP plant in the North East of England is no exception . Situated on the North East coast of England , the- ConocoPhillips Refinery- is one of the largest CHP plants in Europe and together with the refineries that underpin it , employs a large number of people in Grimsby , Hull and Lincoln . <p> The ideas and blueprint for the project began in 1998 as ConocoPhilips sought to upgrade the energy supply for its Humber refinery , which essentially needed more steam for its refinery business . In addition , the existing- boiler providing the steam was- deemed to be out of date and inefficient , increasing the urgency of this- project . The ideal solution was- to upgrade the existing technology so that both efficiency was increased , as well as reducing the impact on the local environment . Electricity generating capacity was also added , allowing- the power plant to be connected to the grid so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , the company was relying on the grid to supply electricity as well as- processes that failed to provide the quantity of- steam required . With uncertainty about gas prices and the capital investment required to undertake a project of this size , Conoco Philips qualified for investment defined under the- UK CHP programme- and under the- EU Cogen Directive , - the project got- the green light . <p> Moreover , the UK Government at the time introduced- Enhanced Capital Allowances- ( ECA 's ) and the- Climate Change Levy , with Immingham CHP being included in these schemes . These measures related to capital investments and designed to encourage quality CHP . In summary they allow for accelerated depreciation for tax purposes , which means those undertaking the investment like Conoco Phillips benefit from a lower tax bill and keep hold of more cash . <h> Key Operational Facts Immingham CHP Power Plant <p> ConocoPhilips ICHP is one of the largest industrial scale CHP plants in Europe . As part of phase 2 , the power station now produces 1200MWs of electrical power and has significantly increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations in November 2004 and peak output is approximately 735 MW . The Phase 2 Extension is proposed to provide an additional 470 MW , bringing the total to a nominal 1210 MW . Phase 1 ICHP Plant produces electricity for the Humber Refinery and supply to the national grid . The additional capacity was expected to be provided to the national grid and to existing and new third party customers . The proposed fuels used on site were natural gas , distillate fuel oil and refinery off-gas . <h> Immingham Power Plant- Business Partners <p> There are two sites , one that holds the refinery and the other that has the Immingham Combined Heat and Power ( ICHP ) plant . Crucially , one of the main outputs is steam , which also serves Total 's neighbouring Lindsay Refinery . Therefore ConocoPhilips definitely uses ICHP as a form of investment that will provide benefits to industry surrounding it in the local area . <h> Environmental Impact Assessment of the Immingham Power Plant <p> An- Environmental Impact Assessment- ( EIA ) was carried out prior to the project getting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was all about keeping the Humber and Lindsay refineries competitive in the European refining market . <p> As an upfront benefit the new ICHP plant reduced utility costs at the Humber Refinery by about 30% . From an environmental perspective it is estimated that the plant , with an overall efficiency of around 70% , will save about three million tonnes of CO2- per year compared with conventional coal fired generation plant . Another key- benefit- arising- from the Immingham CHP is that it contributes- to the energy infrastructure on the South Humber Bank which will almost certainly be required- for future - industrial development in the area . <h> Poplars Anaerobic Digestion Plant <h> Summary of Key Facts Poplars Anaerobic Digestion Plant <p> The biggest anaerobic digestion ( AD ) plant in the UK is located- in Cannock Chase , Staffordshire ; it was completed- in 2011- by the waste management company Biffa . The plant is located at the Poplars landfill site , which is being used to produce gas from the digestion of waste food . <p> The plant cost -24m to build and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strategically important step for Biffa to process waste management of food and exploit economies of scale . The plant is able to process 120,000 tonnes of commercial /- industrial food and organic waste from nearby companies such as Sainsbury 's and Bakkavor . <p> Due to the plant being located near the landfill site , Biffa can use the existing waste management infrastructure to exploit efficiencies , such as a ready supply of suitable feedstock to allow them to produce large volumes of gas , which can be combusted to produce electricity . The total operating capacity of the plant is 6MW , which is equivalent to supplying 10,000 homes with power . <p> In terms of the process , waste is pumped into one of the five digester tanks , which is then heated to 70oc , allowing the AD process to work and produce the methane gas . The plant uses CHP boilers which produce both heat and electricity . About 15% of the electricity is used by the plant , but the rest is sold back to the Grid . The heat generated on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aligns to the Government 's strategy of recycling waste to be used to produce renewable energy . One of the by-products of the digestion process is high quality soil , which can then be sold onto farms and local gardening centres in the West Midlands . <p> In addition , the Poplars AD plant further demonstrates its environmental credentials by helping the local community manage waste by : recycling food waste from supermarkets ; digesting food and drink from manufacturers ; taking waste from hotels , restaurants , caterers and homes , which is then delivered to the site from Biffa 's collection network . <h> Business Partners building Poplars Anaerobic Digestion Plant <p> Biffa had two major business partners during the building phase to- complete the- project by- spring 2011 , - these were the- civil engineering company GTM and anaerobic digestion technology company Ros Roca Envirotec. 
@@36748948 @5748948/ <h> What is OTEC ? <p> OTEC stands for- Ocean Energy Thermal Conversion . It is all about using the differences in warm and cold temperatures of oceans to produce useful products like electric power for coastal or island communities . With- increases in energy prices and technical innovations over the last few years , OTEC systems , such the one produced by the- Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation , - are becoming viable technological solutions to help provide- some of the world 's energy requirements . <p> OTEC technology can not currently be used across the globe- because the heat gradient needed for the OTEC operation needs to be of a- sufficient level . Therefore it- tends to be concentrated among the hottest parts of the planet which are between the tropics . Therefore , it may not be suitable- as an electricity energy solution for- some European and Northern countries . UK companies and people interested in this technology do read on , because although the processes may not be suitable for direct electricity generation , indirectly , companies such as- BG Group , - BP- and- Shell- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gas rigs located in the warm parts of the world , upgrade- for OTEC technology , and supply hydrogen , - the next generation fuel , for cars and household boilers to be used all round the world . <p> OTEC is not like- wind power- or- solar power- ( which are intermittent ) , because the- technology can operate on a 24-7 basis . Oceans act as incredibly- large- solar energy collectors , - absorbing about 80% of the sun 's energy . This means that every day , the- oceans on our planet absorb solar energy equivalent to 250 billion barrels of oil , and if we could convert 0.1% of this energy into electricity each day , it would supply a significant proportion of - electricity and fresh water requirements for agriculture for tropical , coastal regions of the world . <h> How does OTEC work ? <h> OTEC Warm and Cold Water <p> OTEC ( Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion ) works by using the temperature gradients found in large bodies of water , where the temperature of water found on the surface is significantly higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water temperature gradients exist in tropical oceanic regions , because not only do you have the very warm water , but you also have oceanic depth to make use of cold water currents . For example , just off the coast of Puerto Rico , you have an oceanic depth of about 3000 metres , and therefore the temperature of the surface and deep water can vary by more than 20- -C , which is absolutely perfect to exploit the OTEC process . <h> OTEC Process <p> An OTEC power plant works by pulling in warm ocean surface water and this is used to heat a working fluid ' such as ammonia or propane into a gas . These fluids have a low boiling temperature , which when turned into gas , moves the steam into pressurised shafts that are then used to drive turbines . The turbines then drive the generator , which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy . You may now know this part from the heat Rankin Cycle , which underpins electricity generation for current processes such as- biomass , - nuclear- and fossil fuels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth of the ocean is used to cool and liquefy the gas back into working fluid , so the process can start again . <p> As the ocean water can only heat the working fluid by about 20oc , the steam produced from the OTEC process unfortunately does n't carry much energy . However , as the resource , which is ocean water , is abundant , an OTEC power station can harness much of the energy it produces by counting on the large volumes of hot and cold water it requires to operate which goes some way to counteract the lack of efficiency problem . <p> OTEC technology can be harnessed to produce Seawater District Cooling ( SDC ) . This is when pipework takes in deep water , which is cold . It then harnesses this cold water for district air-conditioning as opposed to using lots of electricity and chemicals seen in current systems . These types of systems can save up to 80% or more on electricity usage . <h> Seawater/air conversion <p> The extensive difference in temperatures found between seawater and air in coastal arctic regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where ammonia or propane is used in OTEC systems , liquid butane has to be used in arctic locations due to its lower boiling point . The relative heat of the seawater is used to transform butane into a gas that drives turbines , before the winter arctic air temperature , which can fall to -22 -C , rapidly condenses it and allows for the continuation of the cycle . Although this technique is in its infancy , the fact that it requires half the amount of seawater extraction pipes compared with the OTEC system makes it potentially less expensive and therefore a more efficient concept . <h> OTEC Industry Development <h> OTEC Company- Innovation <p> OTEC technology was pioneered in the late 19th century , but it has only been recent technological advances in heat exchangers that have made the technology a viable commercial source of energy . Companies such as- Lockhead Martin , - Ocean Thermal Energy Corporation- and- Makai Ocean Engineering , who have become leaders in the development of this technology , are looking to bring it to market on a large commercial scale . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , which has the right ocean temperature variations and depth required for this technology to work . Since the 1970s , the US established- Natural Energy Laboratory of Hawaii , has become the leading test facility of the energy source due to the regions warm water surface , and very deep , very cold water . <h> OTEC onshore vs. offshore facilities <p> OTEC technology is not all about electricity generation , it has a much wider scope than that . An onshore OTEC facility can for example not only create electricity , but other products that include fresh water and hydrogen that can promote agriculture and be used as a fuel , respectively . The upwelling of cold water from the depths of the ocean also helps aquaculture thrive , through its fertilising capabilities . Together with a SDC system it can provide the power requirements of an island or coastal community , create jobs and safeguard energy security at low cost which does n't cause damage to the environment . <p> An offshore OTEC facility , as previously mentioned , can be harnessed by companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploitation in remote locations . For instance existing deep water , offshore platforms can be upgraded with OTEC technology for the production of hydrogen fuel . It seems evident that oil and gas companies that also have the transportation facilities can use existing machines to transport this fuel around the world . <h> The future for OTEC <p> We need to move away from the burning of fossil fuels and move to a technology like OTEC to not only produce the energy requirements , but to produce an alternative fuel like- hydrogen , that can be- combusted as an alternative . Fossil fuels are wasted in the combustion processes as this deprives future generations of key materials ( e.g. plastics ) required for commercial and domestic purposes . OTEC is not suitable for all locations , but tropical waters are abundant , so can be used in- conjunction- with other renewable energy sources to help drive a world free from fossil fuel- dependence .

In this section , we discuss- solar PV- and- solar heating- for the home , but there is also a lot of capital investment directed at producing electricity from solar on a- commercial scale . <h> Types of solar power plant <p> There are two types of large scale solar power plants : the first type are photovoltaic power plants , the largest of which is situated in Canada and- is the 97MW Sarnia PV power plant . There are currently eight PV plants , located mainly in Europe , that have a power outage of over 50MW , however there are eight plants planned for the USA that have received funding guarantees that are in excess of 150MW , and these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The largest planned installation is in China , and this will produce 2000MW at peak ( as a reference point- the largest- nuclear power plant- is rated at more than 7900MW ) <p> The other type is the commercial concentrated solar power plants ( CSP ) ; these were first developed in the 1980s . The largest CSP is located in the Mojave Desert in California , known as SEGS CSP and has an output of 354MW . The majority of CSP plants are parabolic troughs ( see below ) , and are located in Spain and the USA . Solar power plants provided Spain with 3% of its electricity in 2010 , and with many more CSP plants in the pipeline this is sure to increase over the coming years . <h> How solar photovoltaic power plants work <p> The process of converting light ( photons ) to electricity ( voltage ) is called the solar photovoltaic ( PV ) effect . Photovoltaic solar power cells convert sunlight directly into solar power ( electricity ) . They use a thin layer of semi-conducting material , usually silicone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When exposed to daylight electrons in the semi-conducting material become energised . These electrons are then able to flow through the material generating a direct current ( DC ) . These are also used for residential needs on a smaller scale , and are discussed in more detail- here . <h> How concentrated solar power plants work <p> CSP power plants do not convert sunlight directly into electricity , instead they use lenses and mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam , which is then used as the heat source much like in a conventional power station . There are a few types of CSP power station but all use the same principal of heating the working fluid by direct sunlight . <h> Parabolic trough solar power system <p> In the case of the parabolic trough system , the sun 's energy is concentrated by parabolically curved , trough-shaped reflectors onto a receiver pipe running along the inside of the curved surface . This energy heats working fluid flowing through the pipe , and the heat energy is then used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many troughs in parallel rows aligned on a north-south axis . <h> Power tower solar power system <p> A power tower converts sunshine into clean electricity for the world 's electricity grids . The technology utilises many large , sun-tracking mirrors ( heliostats ) to focus sunlight on a receiver at the top of a tower . A heat transfer fluid heated in the receiver is used to generate steam , which in turn is used in a conventional turbine-generator to produce electricity . <p> Early power towers ( such as the Solar One plant ) utilise steam as the heat transfer fluid ; current US designs ( including Solar Two , pictured ) utilise molten nitrate salt because of its superior heat transfer and energy storage capabilities . Current European designs use air as the heat transfer medium because of its high temperature and its ease of use . <h> Parabolic dish solar power system <p> Parabolic dish systems consist of a parabolic-shaped point focus concentrator in the form of a dish that reflects solar radiation onto a receiver mounted at the focal point .

The collected heat is typically utilized directly by a heat engine mounted on the receiver moving with the dish- structure . <h> Solar power and the UK industry <p> Producing electricity on a mass scale in the UK does is not currently as commercially viable as- wind power- or- hydroelectricity , although small scale community projects do exist . For example the Westmill Solar Plant , built in 2011 , has one of the largest number of arrays , situated between Oxford and Swindon . Although the level of- Feed-in Tariff- support was cut for small scale producers , twice this year , ROC support still remains at two certificates per mWh of electricity produced for generators of over 5MW . In addition , the UK remains one of the leading nations in terms of providing solar power engineering expertise and solar energy services round the world and will continue to do so over the next few years .

@@36748952 @5748952/ <h> Solar PV and Green Deal Finance <h> September 22 , 2014 <p> UPDATE : As of 30 March 2016 , the government has stopped funding and the Green Deal Home Improvement Fund is closed to new applications . You can read- about it- here. - <p> I sat down with Bernard Hughes last week , the Communications Director from the Green Deal Finance Company and it was very interesting to hear him talk about the Green Deal and how it is all going . <h> Getting Solar PV using Green Deal Finance <p> One point that came out of it was the success of installing solar PV via the Green Deal . He said that many of the plans written to date were for solar PV specifically and actually when you think about it , it is easy to see why . In this blog I am going to show you why getting solar PV via this route is such a good idea for some people . <p> So solar PV costs about -1,650 per KW of panels installed . This means for a 3.5KW system you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " this would consist of 14 panels ( each solar PV panel is 250w normally ) and would produce about 2,800 kWh of electricity per year . <p> Now the Green Deal allows you to get finance on the energy savings that a measure creates . From the Green Deal report ( and we have run this on various reports across London " the numbers may change up north ! ) we have calculated that you will be able to get 12.8p of finance for each kWh of electricity you produce since this can be used in the house , saving you having to buy it from the grid . <p> What this means is that for a 3.5KW ( 3500 watts ) system , you are looking at getting roughly -9,000 finance in total . Now the down side is that -9,000 includes the interest you would need to pay on the Green Deal loan they give you . Over 25 years according to our calculations , it works out at about 60:40 interest to capital , so you would get -3,600 towards the install costs of the solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for solar PV ? <p> So we now have three scenarios to work through <p> The first is paying for the solar PV out of your pocket " this means you would need to find the -7,000 for the system up front . On an average system like this , it works out that you are going to get an annual return of -800 so the payback of the system would be under 10 years and this does n't take into account the rising cost of energy , so it is likely the payback would be slightly quicker than this . <p> The second scenario involves getting Green Deal finance to help cover the cost of the solar PV panels . This reduces your upfront cost down to -3,400 ( -7,000 less the finance of -3,600 ) . You obviously pay this back via the energy savings produced from generating the electricity ( the basis of how Green Deal finance works ) . This does not stop you receiving the generation tariff for any electricity you produce ( @14.38p / kWh ) and also the export tariff for any electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which equates to a return of approximately -400 per year . You could then use some of these tariff payments to help pay off the loan more quickly , reducing the overall amount of interest needing to be paid . Remember the Green Deal does not charge for overpayments . <p> In reality , you get paid as if you have exported exactly half of what you generate via your solar PV since very few people have export meters installed " we explain this in far more detail if you click on the link below <p> If you can install a solar PV optimiser , it is worth doing . This ensures you do n't export any electricity back to the grid ( but still get paid as if you are exporting 50% ) <p> The nice thing about the Green Deal finance option is that if you were to leave the property 4 years down the line , you have only paid 4 years worth of payments on the system " the new homeowners would take on the payments , but they would also receive the feed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills for the units they use in-house . <p> The final scenario is the rent-a-roof scheme , that was big a couple of years ago . Fewer companies offer this now , but you can still find it if you do want to go this route . Basically , the installer company will use your roof to mount the panels " you get the free electricity , but they get all the feed-in tariffs which covers the cost of the installation . There are two advantages of this " firstly there is zero up front cost for the system , the second is that since it is in the best interests of the installer company to keep the panels operational ( because they get payments based on the amount of electricity produced ) " which means if there are any issues , they will be over in a flash to fix them ! <h> Solar PV and the Green Deal " Our view ! <p> So what Green Deal finance has done is given people a nice middle ground " for those that ca n't find -7,000 , they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this person is not going to be in the house for 20 years ( and therefore benefit from the feed-in tariff for this length of time ) then this is definitely worth considering since they only pay for the system as long as they are paying for the bills " the new homeowner will pay for the rest of the system . <p> Speaking to Bernard , he quite correctly pointed out that moving from a free ' system , where energy saving products like insulation and solar PV ( to some extent ) were readily installed by companies at no cost to the customer ( essentially these were grants ) to a pay-as-you-save model ( i.e. you get finance on the energy savings that the measures create ) was always going to be a tougher sell at first , but the number of plans beginning to go through the system shows people are starting to come round to the idea . So while the Green Deal is n't perfect , hopefully this blog has shown you that it can indeed work if you do it right . 
@@36748953 @5748953/ <h> Introduction to solar PV <h> Renewables <h> What is solar PV ? <p> The process of converting light ( photons ) to electricity ( voltage ) is called the solar photovoltaic ( PV ) effect . Photovoltaic solar cells convert sunlight directly into solar power ( electricity ) . They use thin layers of semi-conducting material that is charged differently between the top and bottom layers . The semi-conducting material can be encased between a sheet of glass and or a polymer resin . <p> When exposed to daylight , electrons in the semi-conducting material absorb the photons , causing them to become highly energised . These move between the top and bottom surfaces of the semi-conducting material . This movement of electrons generates a current known as a direct current ( DC ) . This is then fed through an inverter , which converts the power to alternating current ( AC ) , for use in your home . <h> Types of solar panel <p> Different types of solar PV installations require slightly different components . However in the next two sections we have explained in detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PV array and provide you with 100% renewable , free electricity . <p> The solar panel is the- key component of any solar photovoltaic system , which takes the sun 's energy and converts it into an electrical current . There are three main types of solar panel ( as well as the hybrid version ) currently in commercial production , all of which are based on silicon semiconductors : <h> Monocrystalline solar cells <p> This type of solar cell is made from thin wafers of silicon cut from artificially-grown crystals . These cells are created from single crystals grown in isolation , making them the most expensive of the three varieties ( approximately 35% more expensive than equivalent polycrystalline cells ) , but they have the highest efficiency rating between 15-24% . <h> Polycrystalline solar cells <p> This type of solar cell is also made from thin wafers of silicon cut from artificially grown crystals , but instead of single crystals , these cells are made from multiple interlocking silicon crystals grown together . This makes them- cheaper to produce , but their efficiency is lower than the monocrystalline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> These are the cheapest type of solar cell to produce , are relatively new to the market and are produced very differently to the two other types . Instead of using crystals , silicon is deposited very thinly on a backing substrate . <p> There are two real benefits of the amorphous solar cell ; firstly the layer of silicon is so thin it allows the solar cells to be flexible , and secondly they are more efficient in low light levels ( like during winter ) . <p> This , however , comes at a price ; they have the lowest efficiency rating of all three types " approximately 7% 9% , requiring approximately double the panel area to produce the same output . In addition , as this is a relatively new science , there is no agreed industry-wide production technique , so they are not as robust as the other two types . <h> Hybrid solar cells <p> This is not a type of solar cell in its own right ; instead it is a combination of both amorphous solar cells and monocrystalline solar cells . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intrinsic Thin Layer " a bit of a mouthful ! ) , and have higher efficiency ratings than any of the other three types of solar cell alone . In addition , they are also better suited in sunnier climes , where temperatures often exceed 250C , creating up to 10% more electricity . <p> We think in many cases polycrystalline cells are the most suitable option , as they provide- value for money while still also being relatively efficient . <h> Future solar technologies <p> Research is currently underway to develop almost 100% transparent- solar glass , which can be used in building applications . Organic polymer photovoltaics will be ultra-thin and more efficient than existing types , and could see windows transformed into electricity generators ! <p> Perovskite is a new type of solar cell which is more efficient than current types on the market . The technology is currently in refinement , as it has a number of flaws which would need to be resolved before it could be mass-produced . <h> Solar PV inverters <p> All the electricity produced by the solar panels is produced as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity that is distributed through the grid and we use in our homes , which is alternating current ( AC ) . For this reason most solar photovoltaic systems are now connected up with some type of inverter , which changes the DC to AC , allowing the individual to sell the electricity back to the grid ( in grid-tied systems ) or to be used easily in homes . <p> There are 2 major types of inverter that can be installed in your solar photovoltaic system : <h> 1 . String inverters- ( also known as central inverters ) <p> These are used in grid-tied systems where the solar panels are wired together in series , which is known as a string of panels . Each string of panels is connected to a string inverter , which converts the DC current to AC for use in the home and selling back to the grid . You can imagine each string as a mini power station , producing electricity . <p> The main issue with string inverters is that if one of the panels in the string fails or produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impacts the output of all the panels . They will all operate at the output of the worst panel , so- a small amount of shading or debris on your solar array can disproportionally reduce the total output of your entire solar photovoltaic system . <p> They also have relatively short lifespans when compared to micro inverters . <p> The benefits include simple wiring and that you can use thinner wires within your solar PV system , so less copper is used which makes the system cheaper . Buying one string inverter ( which is normally the case of most home solar PV systems ) is also considerably cheaper than buying multiple micro inverters. <h> 2 . Micro inverters <p> These are a newer technology and service each solar panel individually , so each panel requires its own micro inverter and acts as an individual power station . - As a result , micro inverters do not suffer the same performance reduction as a result of shading because any power reduction in a particular solar panel is handled by one micro inverter , having little effect on the combined power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inverters are much more expensive than the string inverters . However much of this cost is offset by the increased performance ( 25% more power produced using micro inverters ) and the fact that they are more reliable than string inverters ( warranties for micro inverters are up to 25 years ) . <h> Buying inverters for your solar PV system <p> When looking for which inverters to buy , ideally you want your alternating current ( AC ) to match that provided by the utility companies . Waveform relates to the quality of the AC signal that an inverter produces . Cheaper inverters will provide modified sine wave signal , while the more expensive versions will produce the pure sine wave signal . Some appliances ( such as computers ) simply do n't work unless they are powered by a pure sine wave signal , so we recommend strongly that you spend a little more to get this type of inverter . <p> Grid tie inverters differ slightly from your regular inverters in that the AC pure sine wave signal has to be perfectly coordinated with the waveform from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more expensive than the typical inverters that you buy . They also have a built-in safety feature to cut off power from the solar array if the electricity grid goes down for any reason . <p> It is also worth noting that most inverters now also have Maximum Power Point Tracking ( known as MPPT ) installed within them , which helps to maximise the electrical output of your solar photovoltaic array system . <p> The principle of MPPT is to extract the maximum available power from the photovoltaic module by making them operate at the most efficient voltage ( known as the maximum power point voltage ) . The algorithm included in the MPPT inverter compares the output from the photovoltaic module with grid voltage and then fixes it at the most efficient voltage , to allow you to export the maximum amount of kWh of electricity back to the grid . An MPPT charger in your solar photovoltaic system will improve your power gain by 20-45% in the winter and 10-15% in the summer . <h> Benefits <p> All solar PV panels are rapidly decreasing in price due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppliers . <p> Monocrystalline solar PV cells are the most efficient type of solar PV cell ( rated between 15-24% ) , so smaller panels can produce equivalent amounts of electricity compared to other solar cell types . <p> Amorphous solar PV cells are the easiest to produce and as the silicon is deposited on any surface , these panels can be made into any shape . <p> Hybrid solar PV combine amorphous and monocrystalline cells giving you the advantages of both of these two types of solar cell . 184564 @qwx384564 <p> Polycrystalline and amorphous solar PV cells are less efficient than monocrystalline , and therefore bigger panels are needed to produce the equivalent electricity output . <p> The technique for building monocrystalline solar cells is more difficult and this is reflected in the higher price of this type of panel . <h> The battery <p> One of the major issues with solar PV systems is that they only produce electricity when the sun is shining . If you are looking to go off-grid or have battery back up in times of grid blackouts , you will need batteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , electricity produced from the solar cells is either used in the home as required , or if there is no demand in the home , it is converted to chemical batteries in the form of batteries . These batteries can then produce the electicity at night to allow you to use your solar PV system 24/7 ' . <p> The electricity produced by your solar system is stored in deep-cycle lead acid batteries that look very similar to the ones found in most cars today ( although structurally different ) . The two most popular types of battery are GEL and Absorbed Glass Mat ( AGM ) , which store the charge very well and do not degrade nearly as fast as the common lead acid ( wet cell ) battery . Both types of batteries are designed to gradually discharge slowly and recharge 80% of their capacity a multiple number of times . <p> An automotive battery is a shallow-cycle battery , and this is designed to discharge only about 20% of its electricity so is unsuitable for solar photovoltaic set-up . The reason being is that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen times , it will get damaged and no longer take charge . <p> Solar photovoltaic batteries tend to operate at 12 volts , and can be arranged in banks ( multiple batteries ) , increasing the storage potential of your solar photovoltaic set up . A bank of batteries organised in a series increases the capacity of your storage but also increases the voltage delivered from your bank , while multiple batteries organised in a parallel circuit increase the capacity , but keep the voltage the same ( mains electricity runs at higher voltage , so if you have a grid tie system it is likely you will try to match this by running the batteries in series ) . <h> Solar Charge Controllers <p> Solar Charge Controllers ( also known as Solar Charge Regulators ) are used in solar photovoltaic systems to prevent the batteries from being overcharged . If you decide to implement a grid-tied ' system , a solar charge controller is not necessary , as any excess electricity that you do n't use at any particular moment is sold directly back to the grid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a charge controller is necessary ; it acts to regulate the flow of electricity between the solar photovoltaic modules , the batteries and your appliances ( known as the load ) . <p> When the load is drawing power ( e.g. you are watching television ) , the charge controller allows electricity to flow from the solar panels directly ( if the sun is shining ) , or from the battery , or from a mixture of the two . The charge controller also prevents damage to the battery by monitoring the flow of electricity in and out . For instance if your system overcharges the battery , it will damage them . The same is also true if you completely discharge all the charge held within the battery . <p> At night , when the solar units are no longer producing electricity , the solar charge controller prevents reverse current flowing from the batteries back into the solar panels . <p> Solar charge controllers also are equipped with highly effective charging programs that maximise the charging speed , while still preventing overcharging . <p> Most are also equipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle of MPPT is to extract the maximum available power from the photovoltaic module by making them operate at the most efficient voltage ( known as the maximum power point voltage ) . The algorithm included in the MPPT solar charge controller compares the output from the photovoltaic module with the battery voltage and then fixes it at the best charging voltage , to get the maximum charge into the battery . The maximum power produced by the solar photovoltaic module is dependent on the amount of sun hitting the solar cells and the temperature of the cells . Incorporating a MPPT charger into your solar photovoltaic system will improve your power gain by 20-45% in the winter and 10-15% in the summer . <h> Solar array mounting <p> As discussed earlier , the amount of power that your solar photovoltaic system produces is dependent on the intensity of light hitting your solar array . There are three types of mounting you can get for your solar panels to help maximise the amount of light that they receive . <h> Fixed solar array mountings <p> These are the simplest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this system , the solar panels will not move at all at any time during the year , so you want to ensure that when you put in the panels they are facing the equator to maximise sunlight . <h> Manually adjustable solar mountings <p> These can be changed a few times a year to adjust for the winter and summer sun . The sun is highest in the sky during the summer months and lower in the winter , so by being able to adjust the angle of your solar array ensures that the sunlight hits the array at the best angle to avoid reflection . <h> Fully automated tracking solar mount <p> These mountings track the sun , to ensure that at all times the angle of the solar array is maximising sunlight . These are certainly the most expensive type as they are constantly moving , but they are also by far the most efficient . Despite this , it has been proven to be more cost effective to add an extra solar panel to your array and use the fixed or adjustable mountings . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local installer map . <p> &gt;&gt;&gt; GO TO OUR LOCAL INSTALLER MAP NOW &lt;&lt;&lt; <p> Alternatively , if you would like us to find you a local installer to help shortly ! <p> Interested in getting a solar PV system installed ? 184572 @qwx384572 <p> Hi Liz , unfortunately it does n't  .

@@36748955 @5748955/ <h> What is greywater ? <p> Water used in homes has long been thought of in terms of clean drinking water ( known as potable water ) coming into the house from the mains and sewage going out . However , the wastewater from baths , showers , washing machines , dishwashers and sinks fits somewhere in-between and this is referred to as greywater , which typically makes up between 50-80% of a households waste water . <p> Roughly a third of the water used in households is used in toilets , which comes into contact with human waste and is known as blackwater . Greywater is much easier to treat and recycle when compared with blackwater because there is no faecal matter that is a haven for harmful bacteria and disease causing pathogens . <p> If recycled properly , greywater can save approximately 70 litres of potable water per person per day in domestic households , therefore greywater recycling is one of a number of water solutions that we should look to in order to decrease our usage . <p> If your house is metered , recycling greywater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving you money on your water bills . <h> How does greywater recycling work ? <p> Please remember that greywater is never going to be safe to drink , even when treated . However the reclaimed greywater can be used to flushing toilets , wash clothes and water your garden . <p> There are various ways to treat greywater , ranging from very simple methods to complex fully automated treatment systems , depending on what you want to use the water for . <p> Each of these is described in detail below . <h> 1 . Direct use systems ( for watering plants ) <p> If you do n't want to treat the water , you need to use it very quickly since bacteria present in the water feed on any organic matter present ( e.g. skin particles , hair and detergents ) and multiply very quickly . Once the bacteria have used up all the oxygen it will become foul smelling , and these anaerobic bacteria can contain harmful human pathogens . <p> Using this greywater is relatively simple , you can either syphon it directly from the bath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ external waste pipe allowing you to direct the water to a water butt , so it can be used as needed to water the flowerbed . <p> It is not recommended to use greywater on fruit or crops , since there is a chance the plant will ingest the harmful pathogens when they are watered . <h> 2 . Biological Systems ( non-food debris ) <p> Sand filter method <p> The initial filtration can be simply achieved using a sand filter that removes any large particles . The greywater enters the top of the sand filter and travels down through the sand via gravity , with the sand removing any sizeable particles . <p> Once the greywater has been pre-treated , it can be filtered using a very simple soilbox consisting of four layers of material . The top layer is roughly 2 feet deep of humus-rich top soil , which sits on a bed of very fine building sand , which in turn sits on a layer of course sand . Finally there is a layer of pea-shingle at the bottom to achieve excellent drainage . The water is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it travels down via gravity through the 4 levels . Most of the filtration takes place in the topsoil level where soil organisms feed and reproduce using the nutrients in the soil , essentially purifying it . <p> Wetland <p> Another way of treating the greywater is using a wetland , where the water is retained at a level close to the surface , allowing aquatic plants such as reeds and bulrushes to flourish . Subsurface wetlands are considered better for treating greywater , as it lowers the chance of odours escaping , there is less chance of freezing during cold weather and has lower human contact , which is potentially dangerous . Bacteria , both aerobic and anaerobic treat the greywater . In addition , the roots of the plants absorb dissolved organic materials , helping speed up the process . <h> 3 . Biological systems ( including food debris ) <p> Greywater with food debris in it needs to be treated anaerobically using a septic tank ( see treating domestic sewage for details on how a septic tank works ) . The water that comes out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated with the soilbox filter or using wetlands as mentioned above . <h> 4 . Mechanical filters ( for using the water to flush toilets ) <p> It is a relatively simple process to undo the U-bend under a sink and capture wastewater in a bucket , which you could then manually pour into the cistern of a toilet . However practically , this is quite a time consuming job for something that can be easily automated . <p> Ecoplay- is one of a number of companies that has produced a greywater pump that pumps water away from a variety of greywater sources including washing machines , showers and utility sinks . When the water enters the pump unit , it can then pump the water vertically to where it is required . The water is then treated in a storage tank ( normally chemically by adding chlorine ) before it is sent to the cistern of a toilet or the washing machine . <p> The greywater can also be treated using more expensive mechanical filters , such as microfiltration systems using membranes . We have looked at this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more information . <h> Uses for treated greywater <h> Using greywater for flushing toilets <p> Typically , about a third of household water is used for flushing the toilet , but reclaimed greywater can be used to fulfil this purpose saving valuable potable mains water . <p> Once the greywater was gone through the complete filter process and treated with chemicals to kill all microorganisms it can be pumped from source back to the toilet via a header tank , and used as appropriate . <h> Using greywater for watering plants <p> A great deal of water is also used in the summer to water plants " this is again a waste of potable water . This can be a major issue where we have droughts , which was experienced quite recently , back in early 2012 . <p> The greywater can be used in combination with an irrigation system to water the garden automatically . This is good to have in place because it targets specific areas of your garden so it is a more environmentally friendly way to care for it . <p> Home water irrigation systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximise efficiency by very specific targeting . This water does not need to be treated with chemicals as any organic material remaining in the water can be absorbed by the plants . It is not recommended to use this type of water with home grown vegetables . <h> Using greywater to wash clothes <p> Reclaimed greywater can also be used for washing clothes ; again this has to be treated to a similar level as the water used for toilets .

If a third of potable water can be saved the cost saving should be used for the installation of a grey water system . The general public would only take up this system if it proved worthwhile , if the potable water had two tiers of charges making it cheaper for those with a grey system installed with the higher tier charged for those without a grey system which would subsidise the cost of the installation of a grey recycling system installed free if charge by the water company . <p> Hi , we have a grey water system that takes water from a 2nd storey bath to flush the toilets in our house and for years their was no problem however for the last few months the smell has been unbearable , I had a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tank was faulty , I fixed it and the chemicals are now delivered correctly however the smell persists , what should I do next ? <p> We have a septic tank and I note that grey water is chemically treated before reuse for flushing toilets .

It is our intention to use grey water to flush the toilet , we intend storing the water in a tank until the water is needed to flush the toilet . If grey water is stored prior to use and only used to flush the toilet would this be a safe method or would there be a problem with storing the grey water from a health point of view <p> Hi Sharon , yes it is fine in almost all cases we would recommend letting the water stand for a little while if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down any contaminants . Having said that , leaving it too long can cause pathogens to form ! So be sensible . Likewise , if you can mix the grey water with water from a water butt connected to a downpipe from guttering , it will help minimise any detergents etc but as mentioned plants will be fine and also grey water can help kill aphids so another positive ! <p> You can not use the water from the septic tank for re using.Grey water is specifically water from showers , hand basins and excludes kitchen sinks.If you require you can use it for irrigation by doing simple pipe works or flushing toilets after the treatment of grey water . 
@@36748956 @5748956/ <h> The Current National Grid <h> Energy Management <h> History of the Grid <p> Britain had the beginnings of its national grid system in 1937 , when a group of engineers connected a series of smaller electrical regional grids , in an effort to increase supply security and reduce overall electrical cost . This was to form the basis of the national grid , which we have relied on ever since to provide us with electricity as and when we need it . <p> However this National Grid was created when energy was relatively inexpensive to generate . This meant- that reliability was ensured through the production of excess capacity . <h> The limitations of the current national grid <p> As we have mentioned previously , the current grid has its limitations . First of all , it is an ageing infrastructure that is creaking and straining under the weight of the current electrical needs of the country . In the sections below we are going to examine some of the issues that the national grid currently faces : <h> Electricity supply and demand <p> Previously , as demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant was installed . Over time though , the cost of installing new capacity has risen dramatically , as has the cost of the fuel used to power it. - Nowadays , more and more of our daily activities rely on electricity . This has led , in spite of improved energy efficiency in many appliances , to a sharp rise in the amount of electricity we consume , pushing up our peak demand to unprecedented levels . <p> This has put the current electrical grid in an interesting position . Energy demand has increased over time ; however new capacity has not been installed at the same rate , so the amount of headroom ( the difference between peak supply and peak demand ) has been dramatically reduced . This has resulted in the need to fire up- older , highly inefficient power stations just to meet current demand . Unless new plans are put into place , things will only get even stickier in- the years to come . <h> Electricity transmission <p> The active process of getting electricity from where it is generated to where it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the demand for electricity has increased , the Grid has been forced to handle huge amounts of electricity that has to be transmitted great distances from its source to where it is required . This is a highly inefficient process , with large amounts of electricity being lost due to lengthy supply lines and basic transmission intelligence . <h> Increase in renewables <p> The UK used to rely on a centralised core of fossil fuel and nuclear power plants running up and down the spine of the country to provide itself with power . However , as these power plants have aged , many have closed down , and a new EU carbon reduction directive has meant that many more are due to close in the near future . <p> The Grid has had to replace this lost capacity by installing new power plants . Since the turn of the century , this new capacity has largely been in the form of combined-cycle gas turbines and renewables . <p> The major issues with gas is that we need to import it and although it is cleaner than coal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue with renewable energy is that it is intermittent ; if the wind is n't blowing , no power is produced from wind turbines . This makes integrating renewables into an ageing and inflexible grid much more difficult , since energy storage will have to be bought into play . This further complicates the energy picture in the UK . <h> Reliance on imported fuels <p> As previously mentioned , many of the UK 's ageing fossil-fuelled power plants are shutting down , however new combined cycle gas turbine plants are still popping up . One of the fundamental issues that we face is energy security . As things stand , the UK is incredibly reliant on gas , especially when it comes to heating homes . This was partly the result of North Sea gas , which we assumed would never run out ! The problem is that unfortunately it has ; so we import the majority of our gas from Qatar and Norway . <p> So ultimately , the ability to heat our homes does not sit with the UK energy companies ; instead we rely on the- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most politically volatile places on earth . We have already seen massive price fluctuations , and its pretty worrying to be absolutely at the mercy of these countries . <h> Centralised energy production <p> The centralised method with which Britain powered the National Grid is fast becoming outdated . Previously , hundreds of fossil fuel power plants would stretch up and down the centre of the country , supplying the nation with electricity . However , with the increase in solar panels and wind turbines comes the massive increase in micro generation . This is decentralising a grid designed to run via centralised means . <h> Increased cost of production <p> Not only is demand increasing , but also generation is becoming progressively expensive to expand . You may have read the recent nuclear power plant go-ahead- and wondered why energy production has become quite such an expensive business . The simple fact of the matter is , that while the current grid system remains , prices of generation will continue to rise and these increases will be passed onto the consumers . Nuclear power is pricey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet be relied upon . <h> So what can we do ? <p> Obviously , peak supply falling below peak demand would cause serious issues , the concept of rolling blackouts has fortunately not been something most of us have come across in our lifetime . However these are a real possibility in the years to come unless we act now so what exactly can we do ? <p> We could be wiser in our electricity usage , try to dampen peak demand and produce electricity closer to where it is needed " Smart Grid <p> Obviously the best thing to do here is to use less electricity and energy , by generally being more energy efficient . This means that , without placing constraints on what you can do , you use less energy in everyday tasks . <p> Increasing the electricity generating capacity is probably the most expensive of the options . This is highlighted by the US Government having calculated that it costs about 3x as much to roll out new capacity , compared to reducing demand through energy efficiency . <p> The final option available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't necessarily mean energy efficiency . Instead it is looking at ways to remove the peaks in our energy demand to allow a lower installed electricity generating capacity to meet our energy requirements .

@@36748958 @5748958/ <h> What is black hole ventilation ? <h> March 7 , 2017 <p> Black hole ventilation is a cheap and easy way to ensure you are keeping your home healthy and discouraging damp from forming in your walls . In this blog we are going to look at exactly what it is , how it works , and why it makes sense to install over traditional and- alternative ventilation systems . <h> What is black hole ventilation ? <p> Black hole vents- stop draughts from going through into your home but still allow air to circulate , ensuring a steady supply of fresh air . <p> With standard ventilators , when outside wind pressure increases , the ventilator let 's more air through and creates draughts . Over the years , they have become increasingly restrictive in an attempt to avoid this and also the problem of vermin and insects getting through . Normal grills are often illegal because they are so restrictive they have very little surface area to allow air through . Black holes , on the other hand , combat these two problems . <p> Inside a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blades as the incoming air is forced to change direction . This creates a narrowed gap for the air- to pass through . As wind pressure increases , the air flow is restricted , avoiding- annoying draughts . The same mechanism prevents insects and vermin getting through the hole , and also blocks light . Moist air therefore diffuses through the vent rather than being blown through ! <h> Why is ventilation important ? <p> To discourage damp and mould , especially in kitchens and bathrooms , where steam often circulates and settles on walls as condensation . <p> If you have an open fire , you could be at risk of a dangerous buildup of carbon monoxide . <p> Avoiding- indoor air pollution . This is a bigger problem than many people realise , and can have direct effects on health . <p> If you have window vents , which are recommended these days , that might be enough . But if you do n't  want to replace existing windows , or vents would look out of place on your period property , a discreet black hole vent might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see so many properties with mould and damp issues , all down to lack of ventilation , that this really is a no brainer . The amount of blocked vents , either on purpose or through poor maintenance , in older pre war properties is staggering , and the best and cheapest way to deal with this is adding quality ventilation . <h> How much does it cost to install a black hole vent ? <p> Cost to supply and fit is -70-100 per vent . This will depend somewhat on the type of wall that needs to be cut through- and where it needs to be fitted . If you are having external wall insulation installed , - it usually makes sense to get these fitted at the same time . Many properties will have standard traditional vents which will be extended as part of the job , but why not spend that little bit extra and get these modern vents installed at the same time ? <p> If you are concerned about how the vents will look , do n't  worry they come in many different colours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your traditional hole in the wall vents . You will be amazed at how ventilation reduces your damp problem and creates a more pleasant atmosphere in your home . <h> Where should you position your vent ? <p> This is not always an easily answered question . There will be aesthetic and practical considerations which means the vent ca n't always go where you want it . Your builder should be able to suggest a good location , but the best position is likely to be at height , somewhere near the windows on an external wall. - The amount of vents you need will really depend on the scale of the problem and the size of the vent you are installing . In some properties with big damp problems , you might need a couple of vents to deal with the problem . The good news is that it is pretty cheap and easy to come back and install another if the first vent is n't sufficient . 
@@36748959 @5748959/ <h> What is hydrogen ? <p> Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe but naturally occurring- hydrogen- on earth is rare . This is because it is highly reactive , and so it reacts with most elements to form compounds that we see around us today . Hydrogen is found in pretty much all the food we eat , in fossil fuels to power our cars and also- in water , which is made up of two hydrogen atoms combined with one oxygen atom . <p> If hydrogen is isolated and ignited with a flame in air , it will combust fiercely and produce heat and water as a by-product . There are already cars that run solely on hydrogen , which means that these cars are 100% emission free . So hydrogen is abundant and combusts with zero dangerous emissions , which makes it a perfect candidate for energy storage . <h> How can hydrogen combat volatilities in electricity demand ? <p> Many countries have electricity demand volatilities , where a large amount of electricity is needed at rush hour , and again when people come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while people are asleep at night , demand is much lower . This is a rather simplistic model , but it demonstrates the electricity demands of the modern world . <p> Unfortunately electricity can not be stored , and at the moment most is either used or wasted as it is produced . However , if we intervene correctly we can transfer the excess electricity into another form of potential energy such as hydrogen . It can then be used to create electricity when required , thereby reducing the volatility of demand on the grid . <h> Producing hydrogen for grid storage <p> The main commercial process used for creating pure hydrogen is steam reforming , which involves breaking down a hydrocarbon into hydrogen and carbon monoxide . <p> However , as an energy storage measure for the grid , the most suitable method of creating hydrogen is through a process called electrolysis , which is simply using electricity and water . Importantly , hydrogen can be produced using electricity sourced from renewable sources such as- wind- and- solar . Therefore when there is excess supply capacity , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess electricity can be used to produce the hydrogen . <p> The process of the electrolysis of water involves passing an electrical current through water , which then produces pure hydrogen gas and oxygen . Two electrodes are positioned in the water , and when an electrical current is passed down the cathode ( the negatively charged electrode ) hydrogen bubbles out , while at the anode ( the positively charged electrode ) oxygen is released . <p> Another potential mechanism for making hydrogen is using algae or cyanobacteria , which use the sun to split water into hydrogen and oxygen . Under normal conditions , however , hydrogen production is secondary to the production of compounds that the organisms use to support their growth . However specialised enzymes can be introduced to suppress sugar production in the organism so it produces much more hydrogen gas . This research is still at an early stage , but the paper that describes the process can be found- here . <h> What do we do with the hydrogen sas produced ? <p> This hydrogen gas can then be stored and used in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be burnt to power a traditional turbine/ generator system ) . In a fuel cell , the hydrogen is combined with oxygen to create electricity without producing any heat . There are several advantages of producing electricity with a fuel cell rather than combusting the hydrogen . The fuel cell operates very efficiently , is very reliable and the only by-product is water " an obvious environmental bonus . <h> The future for hydrogen mass storage <p> The future seems bright for hydrogen as a mass storage technique . The ability to create hydrogen by applying an electric current to water when there is excess supply in the grid is a very simple process. - ITM Power , based in the UK , are currently building an infrastructure to create hydrogen on a large scale by using electrolysis to power industry and road vehicles . <p> The electrolysis units are then positioned where the gas is required . This removes the cost of implementing the infrastructure required to pump the hydrogen between locations , or to carry the hydrogen gas in lorries . <p> The test units they currently have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timeframe . It takes roughly 60kWh of electricity to produce 1kg of hydrogen and that would cost about -7.20 at today 's electricity prices . If this was used in car it would work out at about -0.12 / mile , where as a traditional petrochemical engine would work out at about -0.18 / mile . <p> However if the electricity required to make the hydrogen was sourced 100% from renewable technologies , then the whole process would be 100% emission free . <h> The major issue with hydrogen gas <p> Whilst hydrogen does sound like a genuine mass storage contender , there is one main issue with it , which is storage . It is difficult to store because it has very low volumetric energy density . It is 3.2 times less dense than natural gas and 2,700 times less dense than gasoline . Therefore to store it , it needs to be compressed , liquefied or chemically combined prior to storing . A standard method to do this on a large scale needs to be formalised to ensure that it becomes economical to store the hydrogen . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a word , yes ! Producing hydrogen can be done now and hydrogen has a very high specific energy ( energy per unit mass ) . However the mechanism for producing the gas has to be standardised so economies of scale are introduced into its production , helping to bring the cost of production down . <p> The major drawback with hydrogen is that it takes up such a large space when it is stored . Therefore new , more effective storage processes will need to be introduced , to make its storage economically viable . Rather than turning off- wind turbines- to prevent excess electricity going into the grid , hydrogen storage in fuel cells is an excellent way to conserve energy .

Here , we will run you through where we think the rumour came from , and whether there is anything behind it . <p> We are constantly told that things will give us cancer , from red meat to scented candles , and its easy to get scared once the C word has been mentioned . However , it looks like this particular claim is unsubstantiated . <h> Health effects of fibreglass insulation <p> Fibreglass is a popular choice of insulation due to its cheap cost and relatively good thermal performance . Its a manmade material ; as the name suggests , glass is spun into tiny fibres and then gathered together to form a wool-like texture . <p> You 're probably familiar with one nasty side effect of fibreglass : its itchy as hell if you get near enough .

@@36748962 @5748962/ <p> As of 2009 , nuclear energy accounted for 14% of the electricity across the world , however in some countries like- France- and- Lithuania- more than 75% of their energy is delivered via nuclear sources . <h> Nuclear Fission The Science Behind Nuclear Power <p> When people refer to Nuclear power today , they are referring to the process of nuclear fission . There is another process called- nuclear fusion , which would be our energy game changer- providing limitless cheap energy , unfortunately this has yet to become reality . <p> To understand nuclear fission , first you need a basic understanding of chemistry . <p> An atom of any material is made up of three simple types of subatomic particle ; protons , neutrons and electrons . Protons and neutrons are found in the nucleus of an atom , while the electrons whizz round the nucleus like orbiting moons . These electrons in comparison are incredibly small and carry a negative charge . The protons carry a positive charge and the neutrons are ( as the name suggests ) neutrally charged . <p> The number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of electrons normally equals the number of protons to balance the charge across the atom . In the nuclei of lighter elements , the number of protons and neutrons is normally fairly equal too , but as you move down the periodic table the balance begins to change . The heaviest elements have a dis-proportionally high number of neutrons , and to fuse lighter elements together to create the heavier elements takes an enormous amount of energy ( the sort of energy released when stars explode ) . This means that the chemical bonds in these elements hold an incredible amount of energy , which can be released and harnessed to make electricity . <p> The heavier the atom , the less stable the nucleus , therefore by firing a neutron at the atom , we can disrupt the delicate balance of the nucleus , causing it to break down into more stable lighter atoms . This process will release all the energy required to make the atoms in the first place . This is the basis of nuclear energy and this process is called nuclear fission . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subatomic particle ) is fired at a nucleus , which is then absorbed by the nucleus resulting in the creation of an unstable isotope ( an isotope simply means the same number of protons , but a different number of neutrons ) , which in turn splits into lighter nuclei that are different from the parent atom and neutrons . This reaction creates an enormous amount of heat , one that can be used to turn water into steam , which can drive a generator and create electricity . The neutrons produced in the fission reaction can be captured by other atoms so further reactions could take place ( known as a chain reaction ) with more neutrons produced each time fission takes place , so that the reactions become self-sustaining . <p> Fissile isotopes are isotopes of an element that can be split through nuclear fission , and only certain isotopes of certain elements are fissile . Uranium is the main element used in nuclear reactors ( and atomic bombs ) , with uranium-235 being the specific isotope used . When a neutron strikes the uranium-235 isotope , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then causes the atom to split ( fission ) . The fissioning of this atom can produce over 20 different products . However the resulting product masses when added up , always add up to 236 , with the one , extra , additional neutron that drives this chain reaction process . <h> How we harness Fission today in Nuclear Power Plants <p> The majority of nuclear power today is produced within light water reactors ( LWR ) , which work in a relatively simple way . Hundreds of long , thin zirconium rods are filled with pellets of uranium oxide , lightly enriched with a 5% concentration of uranium-235 , far less than the 90%+ enrichment needed for a weapon . The rods are placed closely together in the reactor core . When a free flying neutron strikes the nucleus of a uranium-235 , the binding energy that holds the nucleus together is released as the atom splits ( fissions ) into two smaller , unstable nuclei , called fission products . <p> As they fly away , one or more neutrons are ejected as well . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to fission , and that 's your basic chain reaction . 80% of the energy released by the reaction is accounted for by the kinetic energy within the fission products , which when hit nearby atoms release a serious amount of heat . <p> This heat is removed from the rods using fast flowing water , which can be used to drive turbines producing electricity . LWRs operate at about 3200C , which is well above the boiling temperature of water , so a great deal of pressure has to be applied to keep the water liquid , and if the water cooling stops , the fission will stop . <p> However , in addition to kinetic energy , the fission products also produce decay heat , and this is how meltdowns occur . If the rods are n't cooled , this decay heat builds up causing the nuclear plants to go into meltdown . A meltdown is when the fuel elements begin to melt , allowing the nuclear fuel to leach into the coolant , potentially allowing long half life radioactive materials to enter the environment . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear plant safety though , which is concentrated on minimising risks of meltdowns . <h> Nuclear Power Industry development <p> Proponents of nuclear energy contend that nuclear energy is a sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions and increases energy security by reducing our dependence on energy harnessed from fossil fuels. - Nuclear power can also produce the base-load power , unlike many renewable forms such as- hydroelectric , - wind- and- solar power plants , which are intermittent . <p> Opponents believe that nuclear power poses threats to people and the environment including processing , transport and storage on nuclear waste and the threat of serious nuclear accidents . - The most important recent event that tipped the tide against more nuclear power was the- Fukushima disaster in Japan , 2011 . However , due to the potential energy crisis that may hit various parts of the world as supply is outstripped by demand , nuclear power has the potential to prevent this becoming an issue . <p> To counter this , plant and reactor investment required is still very capital intensive , especially in these economic times where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you are a company looking to invest in nuclear power , you must note that there are large financial and regulatory barriers to consider . Financial costs include start-up costs , maintenance costs and decommissioning costs at the end of the plant lifecycle . Regulatory barriers also exist , as the industry is regulated for health and safety above anything else . In the UK this service is performed by the- Office for Nuclear Regulation , which is part of the Health and Safety Executive . <h> Nuclear Power development- in the UK <p> The- DECC- policy with regards to nuclear power is to support development in the UK , which means supporting new nuclear stations being built and using existing financial resources to subsidise the clean up and decommissioning of existing reactors . According to the- Nuclear Decommissioning Authority- some -2.3bn per annum is provided by DECC to continue the clean-up process . In terms of scale , this is now calculated as being over 50% of the department 's annual budget . <p> From this summary you can see that the public is still paying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now sceptical whether the private sector has taken all these costs into consideration when looking to invest in new power stations. - By 2025 , most of the existing nuclear reactors would have been decommissioned and the 20% of electricity currently provided by nuclear will have to be replaced by more nuclear or some other form of generation . <p> With financial pressures and social uncertainties towards nuclear , - we saw in March 2012 , - E.ON- and- RWE Npower- pulling out of a series of projects to build nuclear reactors capable of generating 16GW of power . This had followed- SSE's- announcement in September 2011 , which was to promise a complete pull out of the nuclear sector and concentrate its assets on renewables and- carbon capture &amp; storage- ( CCS ) technology . <p> If nuclear power investment does n't happen soon or be replaced by another form of renewable energy , we may see as in Germany and Japan ( who have taken steps to reduce nuclear ) , an increase in fossil fuel electricity generation , as renewables like- wind- and- solar power plants- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap . <p> On balance it is difficult to say whether nuclear investment will happen in the- UK- based on the consideration of cost , risk and future social legacy .

@@36748963 @5748963/ <h> Radiator Booster MK3 Compact <h> The claim <p> The radiator booster improves the circulation of air around the radiator , helping to increase the effectiveness of the emitted heat and therefore saving up to -140 on your heating bills by lowering consumption . It can pay for itself in as little as 8 weeks . <h> How does it work ? <p> Using a series of mini fans , the Radiator booster circulates patches of hot air that are trapped behind a radiator . Once the temperature of the radiator reaches 30C , the fans automatically switch on , sucking up hot air and circulating it around the room . <h> How did it work for me ? <p> I do sometimes feel that my radiators are not working as efficiently as they perhaps could do , and therefore I was curious when I saw the Radiator Booster concept . If it was able to circulate the hot air trapped behind the radiator then surely I would n't need to have my thermostat set quite so high and I would therefore save money on my energy bills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple plug-in and place , and seemed to fit in well with the room . The real test would obviously take place when the radiators were on and above the 30C required to turn the boosters on . While I have to say I could hear the immediate moment that they came on , I soon got used to the very faint whirring ' noise and any television or music being played drowns out the sound completely . <p> I set up a series of thermometers around the room and took readings before and after the radiator booster was installed . While I did n't particularly notice any obvious differences in the temperature before looking at the results , they clearly showed a positive change of around 2C . <p> Negatives : Obvious sound issues may be a concern to many ; along with the potentially negative view many people may hold towards their aesthetic feel . They also require a plug socket within a sensible distance from the radiator . <p> Positives : The increase in temperature consistency throughout the room can not be ignored , and the savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Radflek <h> The Claim <p> Radflek is a revolutionary energy saving radiator reflector that reflects 95% of the wasted heat energy radiated from the rear of a radiator back into your room and claims to cut heat escaping through the walls by 45% . <p> Radflek is a laminated aluminium foil with a long lasting coating that prevents oxidation and preserves its high reflectivity . With Radflek , less energy is needed to heat the room to your desired temperature and so your energy bills will be less . Radflek is at least 23% more efficient than any saw-toothed reflector and will typically pay for itself in under a year . It also lasts many times longer and is much better than using standard foil . <h> How does it work ? <p> The aluminium foil is positioned down the back of the radiator and then as heat is emitted , instead of going out through the wall , the infrared heat hits the foil and gets reflected back into the room thereby reducing heat loss from the radiator . <h> How did it work for me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You simply unroll it , cut to the desired length , then hang it behind the radiator . It requires very little maintenance , just the occasional dust , which is easily done by lifting it out by its hooks . <p> How well do they work ? Well , the science tells us that they do reduce heat loss . Practically , you probably have to be careful that instead of making savings , the house will just be a little warmer . The difference between 21 degrees and 22 is pretty small , and you will only get the energy saving benefit if you consequently use your heating less . If you have a good thermostat you may find the heating is on a little less . If you rely on a programmer , try just cutting the time it is on by 15 minutes . <p> I have a couple of radiators on internal walls so I thought it might be worth putting the reflectors on them . Although it wont affect the energy bills , it will make the room heat a little quicker , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating the walls . <p> It is really important to manage expectations with these reflectors . They will reduce your heat loss and you should see a little fuel bill benefit , but given the relatively small cost , you may only see savings of ten or twenty pounds " worth it in the long run , but easily going unnoticed . 
@@36748964 @5748964/ <h> Nuclear Power in France <h> Background to the French Nuclear Power Industry <p> In 1974 , the French government decided to go nuclear ' as the result of the- oil shock and a lack of any real indigenous energy resources , this was known as the Messmer Plan after the then Prime Minister , Pierre Messmer . With nuclear power at the heart of energy strategy , the aim was to make France completely independent of the oil-rich nations . It was- initially envisaged that- 80 plants were to be built- by 1985 with a further 110 plants in operation by 2000 , based on electricity demand estimates doubling every 10 years . <p> Their demand forecasts fortunately did not come to fruition , and so actually there are currently only 58 commercially operated nuclear reactors in France ( and one test fast breeder reactor ) all operated by EDF , producing approximately 421TWh of electricity every year . These 58 reactors are situated within 20 nuclear power plants and accounted for 78% of the total electricity generated in France during 2011 . <p> One of the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that they were built to similar specification , which resulted in economies of scale during the manufacturing process , in addition to high levels of reliance . The plants are all pressurised water reactors , of which 34 are 3-loop reactors rated at 900MW , 20 are 4-loop P4 reactors rated at 1300MW and the final 4 are 4-loop N4 reactors with a capacity of 1450MW . Despite some of these plants being relatively old ( in some cases over 40 years ) , they have all recently had the operating lifetimes extended through 2020 . <p> In 2006 , EDF confirmed it was going to be building another reactor within the Flamanville Nuclear Plant , Normandy . This will be rated at 1650MW , making it the largest reactor in France , and will give the Flamanville nuclear plant a total operating capacity of 4250MW ( there are already 2 1300MW reactors in this location ) . As a result of the Fukushima atomic disaster , the start has been delayed and costs have also increased . It is thought the plant will now come on line in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Matching Electricity Supply and Demand in France <p> As discussed elsewhere on TheGreenAge , nuclear power is a very inflexible source of electricity , with plants taking several days to generate electricity from their ' off-line ' mode . As such , nuclear power tends to provide much of the base power to the energy mix , with plants being kept on 24/7 as this is by far the most economical way of running the plants , and there is very little flexibility in their output ( when compared to Hydroelectric Power- or Gas Power ) . In France however , they have tried to use nuclear plants in a more flexible way , by attempting- to match supply with demand , meaning- some plants are not in operation over weekends . This has actually meant that the plants have a relatively low capacity factor ( operating capacity as a percentage of full output capacity ) . <p> Despite this , matching supply and demand is not easy , and as such France exports much of the electricity it produces from nuclear , and imports electricity to help meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only export electricity when demand is low , so the price that France receives for its exported electricity is also low . Conversely , when it suffers peaked demand and needs to import additional electricity it is obviously charged at a higher rate . <p> This was compounded in the years following the installation of the nuclear power plants , as there was substantial over capacity at this time , because- the French government had over-forecast actual electricity- demand . As a result , the government pushed the French population to use more electricity to try and increase the base load . The increased base load came from using electricity for heating as opposed to heating- gas or- oil . Unfortunately using electricity for heating is relatively inefficient , unless insulation is prevalent . <p> This over reliance on electricity for heating has resulted in sharp increases in electricity demand when the temperature drops , so actually the demand for imported electricity has increased and costs more . <h> Exporting French Produced- Electricity to the UK <p> As mentioned above , to help regulate supply and demand better , EDF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power plants to neighbouring countries . In 2010 , France exported 2.66TWh of electricity directly to the UK ( National Grid ) , but in total it tends to export between 65-80 TWh / year to it 's neighbours . <h> Nuclear- Energy - Electricity Prices and Environmental- Costs <p> In 2009 , EDF estimated that it produced nuclear energy at a cost of EUR 4.6 cents/kWh , while the energy regulator CRE put the figure at 4.1 cents/kWh , which is a relatively cheap source of power , however it does obviously produce nuclear waste that needs to be treated / stored , and there are decommissioning costs- associated with nuclear power . <p> Nuclear waste- is limited in France though- compared to such countries as the USA , because it is allowed to reprocess old fuel rods , extracting the unused Uranium and Plutonium and making them into new fuel rods . The spent nuclear fuel is all reprocessed at the La Hague site ( this site has almost 50% of the world 's reprocessing capacity ) , which over the years has faced some opposition from organisations such as Greenpeace .

You can set a different schedule for the weekends , when you might be in more . And you can easily change your requirements when the weather warms up . <p> Some heating systems are even simpler ; they just ask you a few questions and set a schedule automatically . Others learn from your habits for accurate meeting of your requirements/finer control <p> It 's surprising how many people waste money heating an empty home .

As the UK is a member of the EU , subsidising industry goes against the spirit of the- Single Market , however the exceptions exist in the renewable energy generation sectors . <p> This is because to get to a level playing field for wind power with the current fossil fuel technologies , European governments need to give these renewable industries a helping hand to encourage investment . As has been seen elsewhere in the industry , in the medium term , where investment has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fallen . As a result in the UK , the governments have reduced ROC support gradually as this technology has become more price competitive . <p> The level of support for offshore wind farms- needs to be greater as the technology is more expensive and there is quite a way for it to go before it reaches- competitiveness vs. the fossil fuel technologies . Bloomberg New Energy Finance ( BNEF ) , however calculates that the output cost of electricity by onshore wind from 2016 , will reach parity with fossil fuels . This is to be driven by further efficiencies and developments in the technology . <h> Onshore and offshore wind in Europe <p> In Europe , the largest wind- farm currently in production is the- -4.5bn Markbygden Wind Farm- based in- Northern Sweden . This project will be finished by 2020 and will comprise of 1,101 turbines , made up of the E-126 turbines and Enercon E-101 ( 3MW outage ) , covering 450km2 . The total energy output of the farm will be 12 terawatt hrs/year ( TWh ) , which will be equivalent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As well as building wind- farms on land , many offshore projects are being built around the continent . Europe is the leader in offshore wind energy , with the first farm being built in- Denmark in 1991 . As of 2010 there were 39 offshore wind farms located in waters across- Europe . Like in the UK , the opinion is that offshore windfarms are now preferred over- onshore windfarms- because they are less obtrusive than those built on land , and their noise and size is mitigated by their location away from urban areas . <p> In addition , water has less surface roughness than land , so- the average wind speed is higher out at sea so , - thereby- increasing the- electricity generating capacity of these farms . However , there are environmental impacts to consider for offshore wind turbines their construction can destroy fishing habitats , and there is a large amount of oil needed to lubricate efficient operation of turbines- which has the potential to- leak and affect the marine ecosystem . <h> Wind power development <p> Wind power is intermittent , only producing- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so- without storage , wind power- can not be aligned to the demand fluctuations very easily . Many- larger power stations also- lack- flexibility in their production of- electricity , for example , a- nuclear or coal power station produces the same amount of electricity every minute , and this electricity can not be stored . <p> Throughout the day there is differing demand for electricity , so during night the demand is lower than at dinner time for example . Therefore , within the electricity mix there needs to be a variety of sources to deal with this fluctuation in demand and one of the most flexible is hydroelectric . This can be turned on and off within seconds to meet any extra demand . Tethering of wind turbines to hydroelectric facilities is currently being investigated ; by using the wind power to pump the water back to the top reservoir , the whole system requires no external power support so is completely green and is therefore a very flexible electricity production method . <h> UK commercial wind power policy <p> In the UK , there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While many scientists , investors and environmentalist groups are unequivocal in their support , others have voiced their opposition , particularly on the subject of onshore wind . Although onshore technology is now developed and building windfarms is relatively- cheap , environmentalists have objected to more being built as they further blight an already disappearing countryside . Those that support onshore wind- have criticised successive governments for reducing , and signalling further reductions in- the- ROC- support . <p> Offshore wind has been hailed as the future ' for renewable power and a technology where UK engineering can really excel , and export that expertise for the benefit of growing a low carbon economy . Bodies like the- Energy Intensive User Group , on the other hand , object to the level ROC support for offshore wind ( currently 2 ROCs as mentioned above ) , and call for a solution that is based on economics and cost such as increased efficiency measures , increased nuclear and increased- onshore wind . <p> Despite the confusing messages , investment and implementation of onshore and offshore wind continues in the UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 , - SSE , announced that it had surpassed 1GW of energy generation from its onshore wind farms . Further investment is being planned by companies such as- Infinergy , - Vattenfall- and- Gamesa- in both of these two technology areas . Offshore however is going to require more technological advancement before it sees accelerated growth and energy cost parity with other technologies . <p> In Europe , the trend has continued to accelerate commercial wind development . There is much ongoing research into wind turbines and the aim is to increase their capacity and output . Denmark is leading the way with ambitious target setting planning to deliver half of its renewable energy output with wind power . Other big projects include : ( 1 ) Norwegian company- Sway- is currently building a 10MW turbine that is due for completion this year ( although it will undergo two years of testing ) ; ( 2 ) Plans afoot to build a 15MW turbine off the coast of Spain by 2015 , called the- Azimut.

It is- one of the greenest Swimming centres- in the country and also has the lowest carbon footprint amongst its peers . The fitness centre that is housed near the Stadium of Light , - Sunderland Football Stadium- holds a state of the art 50m Olympics style swimming pool and fitness centre facility . The centre is part of a series of regeneration projects in the area by drawing in both national and internal swimming competitions and improving the health and wellbeing of local residents . <p> This sporting facility utilises both energy efficiency measures such as collecting rainwater on the roof and insulation measures to make sure that heating is effectively utilised . In addition and pertinent to this section the facility uses an- ENER-G CHP- unit that provides both heating and power simultaneously and limits the facilitys- reliance on the grid . <p> The CHP scheme for which the Aquatics Centre operates under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This means that ENER-G installs , finances and generates and then sells the energy back to the Aquatics Centre for a discounted rate . <h> Sunderland- Aquatic Centre - CHP Unit Details <p> The CHP unit that operates on the site is a self-assembled 185kW system . Unlike convention heating and electricity , CHP on site maximises energy effectiveness and minimises heat loss . For example , conventional electricity comes through miles and miles of cabling , which wastes power . The closer the energy source to the demands , the less wastage for the transmission of electricity . <p> At the Aquatic Centre , the CHP unit heats the pool and also the building that houses this facility . <p> In total , if the unit is running 17 hours per day and utilises the heat produced , this equates to a total of -32k of savings on the energy bills per annum . <h> Business Partners Constructing the Sunderland Aquatic Centre <p> The project would n't have been successful without the knowledge of business partners who all contributed to their particular area of expertise . Along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructing timber beams ; Laminated Veneer supplied by- Wiehag- and the main contractor being- Arup . <h> Sustainability of the Sunderland Aquatic Centre <p> From the building design to the materials and power sources , all these inputs ensure that the Aquatic Centre leaves a sustainability legacy in the local area . The rainwater for example , falls on the roof when it rains ; then it is harvested and filtered and finally treated for the use in the pool . All of this reduces the overall use of the water supply from the external water company . <p> Up to 3 years of operating , the CHP unit in the Aquatics centre has managed to reduce carbon savings of over 500 tonnes of CO2 , which is equivalent to planting just over 82k trees . This does n't take into account the additional energy efficiency measures talked about such as on insulation , building design , air circulation improvements and harvesting rainwater . 
@@36748974 @5748974/ <h> What is solar glass ? <h> October 18 , 2016 <h> What makes solar glass different from traditional panels ? <p> BIPV building-integrated photovoltaics are solar panels designed to replace conventional building materials in parts such as the roof , skylights , facades and windows . <p> The key difference between this technology and traditional solar PV is that panels are built into the building rather than being tacked-on . This means there 's more of a relationship between aesthetics and functionality ; it is- all about getting a balance so that one is not at the expense of another . <p> This week , we visited Polysolar , a Cambridge-based company founded in 2007 . They are pioneers of thin-film solar panels- and they gave us an introduction to the technology . <p> There are currently two types of BIPV available , and one more in development . Before we discuss these , let 's start at the beginning- with- crystalline silicone technology . These are the blue/black metallic solar PV panels you 're probably familiar with. - To work at a good efficiency , they are also thick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into buildings . This is why companies such as Polysolar are developing alternatives . <h> What solar glass products are currently available ? <p> Thin-film modules . These have been around for a few years . They can be designed into the fabric of a building and can perform in conditions/locations where crystalline silicone panels can not . However , the amorphous silicone they are made from is naturally orange in colour , and only up to 20% transparent . <p> Colourless PV glass . This is black , with varying levels of opacity . It can be up- to 50% transparent much- more than- traditional PV . They can be used for instance in balconies , skylights or in facades ( alternated with standard- windows ) . Thin film panels work in non-optimal conditions , in lower light and higher temperatures . This means a longer day of solar gain compared to traditional panels . If double glazed , they have a U-value of less than one , meaning the energy efficiency of the building is not compromised . However , they are expensive to produce and transparency is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glazing . <h> What are the benefits of thin-film solar panels ? <p> Aside from that they can- be installed as part of a house , these panels actually perform better in many ways : <p> They- tend to be less affected by high temperatures it does n't  reduce their performance as much as it does other types . <p> The new panels also insulate better than standard glass ( a reason why people sometimes shy away from designing windows with glass facades ) . <p> Polysolars modules operate in as little as 10% sunlight although PV panels positioned at the right angle on a roof will receive more light than vertical panels . <p> The panels are designed to reduce heat gain so they will get less warm in summer than other properties with glass features . <p> They are highly customisable any colour/opacity of backing can be included- to make panels matte or hide the pin stripes . This does slightly affect solar gain though . <p> It is a relatively cheap and easy way of achieving a BREEAM ( zer0-carbon rating ) on your building . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thin-film modules and new ultra-thin panels are less efficient than the older technology . However , the yield per unit area of solar elements in thin-film and ultra-thin film , although currently lower , are rising by around 1% per year . With research and development , they will eventually catch up with their predecessor in this respect . <h> What is the future of solar glass ? <p> Polysolar is currently developing the next generation , organic polymer pholtovoltaics . They estimate that this new ultra-thin solar panel will be ready for commercial use in 2 years . The idea is that it will be almost fully transparent , and therefore suitable for use in more applications and styles of building . It will- work- on most surfaces , at most- angles placement will affect yield , but not as much as traditional panels . It is also hoped that the new method of production will keep costs down . <p> Todays panels are already being designed into new and existing buildings , including office blocks in Canary Wharf . Organic polymer photovoltaics could conceivably replace all windows/glass in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always be ever so slightly tinted but not pixellated like its predecessors . <p> Polysolar believe- they can make the installation cost realistic even competitive and that the measure it will pay back within 8-10 years- in its cutting of energy bills . The more people who adopt the technology , presumably- the price of materials and installation will drop . If you can fit it into the design of the building and have the initial budget to inject , it seems like you cant lose , because itll pay for itself in the long run . While changes to the Feed in Tariff mean its not much of an incentive any more , design and green building ratings are more important than ever . Most importantly , its- free , renewable energy to power your home ! <h> 2 comments <p> I am interested in installing solar glass in my home as part of a retrofit . I am not sure whether this is a viable idea , but basically I want the house to pretty much power itself , so looking at getting solar panels on the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows . I also cant see any prices in this article . Do you have any approximate prices you could share ? From what I understand solar PV is about -1250 per KW . <p> Hi A1935Theeco , unfortunately solar glass is still very much in the development phase . I think the future of solar glass is bright , especially given the fact that architects and builders are using far more glass in new builds than they have done previously . That being said , it will definitely be far more expensive than the -1250 per KW you have quoted above for solar panels . I think if you are doing the build in the near future , then my advice would be to maximise the solar panels you put on your property and potentially leave the solar glass until your next build ( provided you are going to live in the property for 5-10 years ! ! ) 
@@36748976 @5748976/ <h> Trump pulls out of the Paris Agreement <h> June 2 , 2017 <p> Last night , in one of his most controversial moves yet , President Trump announced his intention to pull the US out of the Paris Agreement . What will it mean for the US and the rest of the world ? We spoke to Dr. Frederik Dahlmann , Assistant Professor of Global Energy at- Warwick Business School , to get his expert opinion ! <h> With big business leaders denouncing his decision , how wrong is Donald Trump that limiting climate change is bad for business ? <p> The US President 's assertion that limiting climate change is generally bad for business is evidently wrong given the very significant growth in renewable energy investment and jobs in recent years , particularly the US , where there are already more than twice as many people employed in the renewable sector compared to the coal sector . Of course , all policy decisions have an impact on business in some way . So , in that sense it is vitally important that all climate change-related actions take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) into account and provide credible support and opportunities for economic rehabilitation . <p> At the same time , many of the US ' biggest and most innovative companies have repeatedly countered President Trump 's argument that climate policies are strictly bad for business . Their engagement with climate change has led to significant ( green ) product innovations and process improvements . These have saved businesses countless dollars in energy cost while making them internationally more competitive , improving their reputations and attracting a workforce that 's increasingly demanding such actions from their employers . Donald 's Trump focus is extremely narrow in its overriding concern for one particular sector , while ignoring the large and varied positive economic impacts already being experienced- by many other firms . This short-term focus is even more worrying given repeated assessments of the economic long-term implications favouring short-term costs from climate change mitigation compared to the significant financial burdens arising from adaptation once physical climate change begins to impact our economies . <h> What are the biggest ways in which the US evading environmental regulation could impact the planet ? <p> First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accord will legally take at least three years to materialise . This will mainly damage the country 's geo-political standing more than anything else . In the meantime , the President is likely to continue his efforts to reduce environmental regulatory interventions within the US designed by his predecessor to overcome congressional inertia . This would largely affect the fossil-fuelled power sector where utilities would benefit from more relaxed power plant operation criteria . The question as to whether these companies will actually reverse some of their previous decisions then depends on economic trends . Here , the increasing availability and low prices of natural gas and the steadily falling costs for renewable energy are far more likely to shape their decision making . What this points towards is that while the US might formally and symbolically lift its foot of the climate policy pedal , with possibly minor negative consequences for the country 's carbon emissions in coming years , in reality factors beyond the US ' membership in the Paris Accord are more likely to ensure that these consequences are less severe than feared . <h> What has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong is Trump that the reality is that withdrawing is in America 's economic interest and wo n't matter much to the climate . ' - <p> Reaching an international agreement on climate change in Paris was the outcome of many years of cumulative efforts , often fraught with major setbacks , to develop a deal between all the nations of this planet regardless of whether they were large or small , developed or developing . Despite the eventual elation about agreement in Paris , the Accord also faced criticism and all parties are aware of the significant challenges still ahead in implementing it . Still , more than half the world 's nations have already formally ratified the agreement and therefore signalled their commitment going- forward . Since then , some progress has been made but many obstacles and uncertainties remain . <p> As I suggested above , the reality is that apart from certain sectors and vested interests , overall withdrawal is in neither America 's economic nor geopolitical interest . There is a chance that the withdrawal might not matter much for the climate because other American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on regardless . But if that 's the case , then there is no need for the US to withdraw . Instead , President Trumps relinquishes a crucial leadership opportunity for the United States . <h> Is there any truth in Trump 's claim that the agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States ' ? <p> Inevitably , countries sign up to international agreements because they believe it is in their interest . The assertion that they do so to gain financial advantage over the US is implausible . Countries have signed up to the Paris Agreement because they recognise that internationally concerted efforts are in everyone 's best interests in the long term . Payments to support developing countries with their transition recognise developed countries ' historical responsibilities from having already polluted the atmosphere to very substantial levels . In that sense , such payments , which Trump interprets as financial advantages , simply reflect the principles of fairness and common but differentiated responsibilities towards addressing climate change . <h> How can we continue to encourage world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> In my opinion , this is not so much a question of acting in leaders ' best interests , but ultimately in citizens ' and their descendants . As such , voters need to continue demanding from their leaders to do more to understand the challenges of climate change and to develop smart , economically-supportive policies that decouple economic growth from carbon emissions while creating new and good quality jobs in sectors with a long-term future . Leaders then have a responsibility to ensure that these policies do not collide at the world stage where the effects of trade and globalisation can create social , economic and environmental disparities . The Paris Accord was designed to create a foundation for leaders to address such issues ; President Trump appears ignorant of the world in the 21st century and the role the agreement plays as part of this process . <h> A quick one , off-topic . What do you think of the environmental/energy policies contained in the big UK parties ' manifestos ? <p> I would only comment that , apart from Labour 's proposed renationalisation of parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap energy prices , environmental issues have largely been pushed into the background in this election campaign . Yesterday 's announcement by President Trump has certainly revived part of the broader debate and I would hope that this will find its way back into the discussion . Ultimately , environmental issues have broad social , economic and geopolitical consequences and should therefore be raised more strongly . 
@@36748977 @5748977/ <h> Why is ventilation important ? <h> January 11 , 2016 <p> Pretty much every home in the UK will have some form of ventilation , whether that be extractor fans , natural open vents , or black box vents . Many people do n't understand the importance of them , and block them up or cover them with the assumption- that more vents mean more draughts . However , this does n't  have to be the case . <h> Why is ventilation important ? <p> Ventilation is important in the home for several important reasons . Here are some of the key ones : <p> Condensation " If there is not enough air flow in the home , condensation can build up and cause damp and mould . This can be avoided by improving airflow , warming the walls up through insulation techniques and / or use of mechanical ventilation and dehumidification . For most homes , the addition of some vents will greatly reduce this problem . <p> Fuel combustion " Older open flue boilers and gas fires rely on good ventilation in the room to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vents are blocked off , the air in the room will be used up , and the boiler may start to produce carbon monoxide " a lethal gas . Ventilation is therefore very important if you have one of these older boilers . <p> Preventing rot " Homes with suspended timber floors will have ground level vents that allow the air to circulate around the floorboards . This prevents the timber from suffering with damp and eventually rotting . <p> Health " Not only are all the above dangerous to health , good ventilation will ensure that you are breathing good quality air and that the rooms do n't get too stuffy . <h> How much ventilation is needed ? <p> This will vary from property to property , so there is not a hard and fast rule for everyone . There are however , standards that a heating engineer should adhere to when checking your boiler . <p> If you notice any damp in your property , or there are condensation issues , the first step should be to check whether any vents have been blocked off , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they can often get clogged up with dirt and detritus over the years . They may look open from a distance , but once you get a wire brush and give them a clean , they soon reveal their true nature . <p> If there are very few or no vents in the property , consider getting in an expert to check whether ventilation could help . Installing a vent in your wall should cost no more than -150 or so . A simple solution to a really common problem . <h> What type of vent is required ? <p> There are a few different types of vent available : <p> Terracotta Air Bricks " These are very common on older buildings , and can be found at ground level to ventilate floorboards and at elevated levels to provide room ventilation also . These types of vents work ok but they are liable to allowing wind to blow through the vent creating draughts in the home . <p> Black Box Vents " These types of vent are usually made of plastic and have a restrictor inside that prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady movement of air . This is a good form of natural ventilation that minimises the efficiency losses inherent in adding ventilation . <p> Mechanical Exhaust " Extractor fans , air conditioning units etc all move air around the building and can helpwith issues like condensation . You should not rely on these forms of ventilation to air a room for a boiler however , as they are not 100% reliable like an open natural vent is . <h> Plastic vent covers <p> Whilst you may have a vent that appears open , we often see vents that have been covered with a plastic grill designed to prevent flies or rodents from entering the property . Unfortunately these types of grills massively restrict the surface area of the vent holes , reducing the amount of air able to move through the vent . This means that a vent once good enough to ventilate the whole room , will now not have the sufficient area to meet the ventilation requirements . <h> Are your vents in the right place ? <p> Another common problem we see is that a vent is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little snow in the winter will block it , preventing adequate drainage . You may also have vents that have been built around " for example , a new kitchen has been fitted meaning the vent now opens into a cupboard or to a dead space at the back of a unit . Whilst not physically blocked , the vent will no longer be able to perform adequately and you should look at relocating the vent elsewhere . <h> Ventilation is important <p> The key message to take away here is that you should be aware of the ventilation in your property and remember to check that both the vents you have are sited correctly and in good working order , but also that they are sufficient . 184565 @qwx384565 <p> A good general overview of the importance of ventilation but it would be good to cover a bit more detail such as the different types of ventilation : uncontrolled , semi-uncontrolled and controlled .

@@36748978 @5748978/ <h> Heatmiser SmartStat review March 2016 <h> March 2 , 2016 <p> About 9 months ago we moved into our new home " and as such it gave me free reign to install as much energy saving equipment as I liked ( which I am sure my partner greatly appreciated ! ) . One of the things I really wanted to get right was the heating controls I installed . There are a huge number of Smart Controls ' currently available to give you better control over your heating " so here I wanted to briefly look at the one I went for and- my reason for choosing that particular one over all the others currently available . <p> To set the scene , our property is a traditional Victorian mid terrace " the place was gutted so we had the chance to insulate the house to within an inch of its life . In addition , we also had access to put in a new more efficient heating/hot water system . We decided to keep traditional radiators upstairs , but downstairs we opted to install underfloor heating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Smart heating controls had to be able to handle both underfloor and radiator heating systems as well as the ability to produce hot water , since we installed a system boiler with a pressurised hot water tank . The plan was to create- four separate zones " - two for the underfloor heating downstairs , one for the first floor and a final one for the loft room " this was important since these zones were used in different ways with different heating requirements . <p> The one thing- we had in our favour was that we did n't have to go for a wireless thermostat " we could go with a wired version because we could bury the wires within the stud walls while the house was being rebuilt. - This meant that we had a lot of choice in thermostat , because Hive , Nest , Tado and Heatmiser- four of the big players in the market all require a wired connection . Obviously you could try and retrospectively hide the wires ( basically in wired systems there is a wire running from the thermostat unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiler ) but it is always going to be a struggle . We would have had a much slimmer choice if this was not the case " I think it is just Heat Genius and the EvoHome that offer wireless connection . <p> So which did I go for ? Well I am assuming from the title you can guess I went with the Heatmiser SmartStats . <h> Initial thoughts on the Heatmiser SmartStat <p> There are a few reasons why I chose this one. - Firstly I had heard really good things from colleagues and friends in the industry ( including a senior man at Honeywell ! ) " so here are my first thoughts on having had the system for the last 4-5 months : <p> The Heatmiser Smartstats are pretty slick on the wall . The units look very neat and are n't overly bulky " presumably in part because they are wired so do n't need any wireless kit within them. - This was- one of the key requirements set by my partner , hence it is no.1 on the list " she has n't complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> The Smartstats and the associated app are very easy to use " the app allows everything to be controlled remotely and although I do n't use the Geofencing feature it is there if required geofencing is simply a setting where the thermostat knows when you are in / out of the house and automatically sets the heating accordingly to save on heating costs if no-one is at home . I like the way Heatmiser have really opted for simplicity ; I honestly think even if someone were given the app , they would be able to figure it all out with 10 minutes or so . <p> Comfort levels " this is fundamental to how the Smartstat works . The comfort levels are temperatures that you set to ensure the house is the temperature you want when you want it . In the old days you set a time for- the heating to come on- and it would fire up until the air temperature reached what- was required normally governed by the thermostat " at which time it turns off. - With the Heatmiser SmartStat , you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you wake up , when you leave for work , when you get home and so forth and it will learn how long it takes to get the house to get to the required temperatures and then turn on the heating the right time in advance so it is at the perfect temperature at all these times " it works very well . <p> Since I have a hot water tank , it was pretty fundamental that I had control over when my hot water came on . Believe it or not , the Nest thermostat has only just started being able to control hot water . The downside of this ( and I understand why but that is n't the point ) is that I need a whole separate thermostat unit to control the hot water . In order to set the Heatmiser Smartstat to control the hot water you need to set it up in Time Clock Mode ( as opposed to thermostat mode ) . You simply then decide how many hours the hot water is on for " and an appropriate time for it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the SmartStat app on iphone if you need to change it or set a boost remotely to ensure there is enough hot water to come home to . <h> Are there any- issues with the Heatmiser SmartStat ? <p> Having to spend extra for the hot water control ! It is a clever work around , but it would have been great to have one master unit that controls the temperature in one zone and also does the hot water instead of having to buy separate thermostats for each zone and an additional one for the hot water . <p> Next , my thermostats initially struggled to stay connected to the internet " I am not sure where the blame sits there " is it my Sky Broadband or is it SmartStats ? To be honest , I have a wireless printer connected to the broadband and that never seems to drop out , but maybe I was just unlucky . I spoke to the tech team at Heatmiser when I was having these issues and they told me that they could send a firmware update remotely to the thermostats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . It seems to have done the trick ( touch wood ) as you can see from my photo below the zones are all there with temperatures being recorded . <p> Not using the floor sensor for the underfloor " this strictly should n't be in the issues pile , but I thought I may as well mention it so others do n't fall into the same pitfall . Basically , when you lay underfloor , they recommend laying a floor sensor to record the temperature . I had laid my floor before making my mind up on what thermostat I was going to buy , so by the time I opted for the Heatmiser model it was too late to use the floor sensors . Instead I have to control the underfloor heating with standard air temperature sensors. - This is fine , but it means I have to set the comfort levels on those two zones very very low otherwise the rooms get warm ! <p> I appreciate that this is totally- my fault , but it is- still annoying ! <p> The final thing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heatmiser SmartStat does n't offer individual TRV control . The TRV is the temperature control on the radiator " and there are systems ( namely Heat Genius and EvoHome ) that do allow a fully integrated thermostat / TRV / programmer system . The truth is I have no need for it and I think it would have been a waste of money for me " but for some people it might be an important thing ! <p> So there you have it " if you have any specific questions about the Heatmiser SmartStat ask in the comments section below and I will be sure to come back to you with an answer if I can ! If you wondering the cost of the SmartStats were -125 each so a total outlay of -625 " obviously not cheap , but this is my geeky thing so do n't judge ! <h> 6 comments <p> Hi Thanks for this very useful I am under process of refurbishing my house and decided to install underfloor heating and wanted to know your experience so far with heatmiser If I would to install this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your second house <p> Hi . So weve just moved into a house with a garden office which ha a heatmiser system wired into it to I believe two of the wall sockets . Which I suppose means that I can plug electric heaters into those two sockets and control them from the heatmiser control ? Does it matter then what sort of electric heater I plug in and I presume I would n't use electric heaters with built in thermostats as they would I presume cancel each other out ? <p> I am so looking at the heatmiser control and am wondering what are the differences between the smartstat and neostat which is much cheaper . Have you considered neostat and if yes , what made you go for the smartstat at double the cost ? Thank you . <p> Hi Milo , it is basically the fact the Neostat has to have an additional Hub unit .

Experts estimate that up to half a million people die prematurely each year as a direct result of breathing this dirty air . Many do n't  know , however , that the problem can be even worse within your home .

@@36748980 @5748980/ <h> What is chemical energy storage ? <p> An example of chemical energy storage is the common battery . By using the liquid inside it to store electricity it can then release it as required . Large batteries can act as chemical energy storage for industry and could make future energy generation solutions more efficient and profitable . This will be achieved by storing energy generated when demand on the grid is low and releasing this as required to help meet peak demand . <h> How does the battery chemical energy storage process actually work ? <p> Batteries are portable devices that can be used in many different areas . The way a battery works is very simple and based on three components : <p> The anode ( the negative pole ) , <p> The cathode ( the positive pole ) , <p> The electrolyte ( the liquid chemical that produces the flow of energy ) . <p> The anode and the cathode are also known as terminals ' and are made of a metal , which are then separated by the electrolyte . <h> Converting stored energy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulb or a simple electrical circuit and connect it to the battery terminals , the chemical on the anode causes a release of electrons to the negative pole and ions in the electrolyte . This is the chemical oxidation reaction . <p> On the positive pole the cathode accepts the flow of electrons , which completes the circuit for the flow of electrons . These two reactions happen simultaneously : the ions transport current through the electrolyte while the electrons flow in the external circuit . This then generates the electric current . <h> Storing electrical energy in a chemical store <p> The process for battery energy storage works in reverse , transforming electrical energy into chemical energy . When excess electricity is produced in the grid , it can be channelled into a battery system , and then be stored in the chemical system . <p> The mobile phone and electric car both take advantage of a rechargeable battery system . The hope is that in the future this process could be up-scaled ' : when electricity is produced by intermittent renewable sources like- wind- or a- solar PV- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> What types of batteries can be used for mass energy storage ? <p> There are a number of different battery solutions that are currently being used in industry and under consideration for mass scale national grid use . This section briefly considers each type for these ambitious future requirements . <h> Lithium-ion Batteries <p> Lithium-ion batteries are the fastest growing battery type in the consumer market today . They have many uses , including powering laptops , mobile phones and hybrid vehicles due to the high amount of energy they can store . They also have high energy-efficiency , operate well under a wide range of temperatures , can be recycled and also have a low level of self-discharge . <p> However to be used as a grid storage solution this type of battery will require some refinement . They will need to operate with improved lifespan ( number of charging and discharging cycles that can be achieved ) and improved safety . Most importantly the cost to produce the lithium-ion batteries needs to come down " a storage solution these days needs to be cost effective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lithium-ion polymer batteries not only have a high-energy output , but also have a good safety record and a longer life span . However these are also uneconomical to produce , so the production costs would need to come down to make these viable as the mass-produced storage solution . <h> Lead-acid Batteries <p> Lead-acid batteries can be designed to power large applications and are relatively cheap , safe , and reliable . They are already being used in large storage and uninterrupted power supply solutions ( e.g. emergency lighting and powering back-up generators ) , which means they can be increased further in size to power grids. - They can also be easily recycled and an infrastructure around this process already exists . <p> The problem they have is that they are rather large , heavy and immobile . They also have poor cold temperature performance and a short life cycle . <h> Flow batteries <p> There are several characteristics of a flow battery system that will enable them to provide very high power and very high capacity on a grid type system . For example , unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the energy storage capacity . While output depends on the fuel cell stack , the energy storage depends on the size of the electrolyte tanks and these are independent from one another . This operating capability is very useful when large current flows need to be transported to a national electricity grid system . <p> Energy output ratio to weight can be up to three times better than lead-acid batteries , but they do have lower energy efficiency . <p> At the moment , there are only experimental flow battery schemes in operation and , since they have n't been around as long as the lithium ion battery , it is taking longer for electricity distribution industries to adopt them . <h> Sodium sulphur <p> A sodium " sulphur battery is a type of molten-salt battery constructed from liquid sodium and sulphur . The sodium-sulphur battery has a very high energy and power density as a result of sodium being a highly reactive alkali metal . This type of battery has a high energy density , high efficiency of charge/discharge ( 89 " 92% ) and long cycle life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they operate at a temperature of about 300-3500C , and therefore they require energy to keep them operational . And , due to the highly corrosive nature of sodium polysulphides , such cells must be kept stationary . Therefore they are ideal for for energy arbitrage , which is when the grid system fluctuates between peak demand and supply , so the battery can help manage the load . <h> Could chemical energy storage be a commercially viable solution ? <p> We are still far from producing batteries that are a viable and cost-effective solution to managing the variation in grid systems . It would be incredibly expensive to make batteries capable of storing excess energy on the grid . So if this energy storage solution was implemented it may significantly increase the cost of electricity to consumers , which would be highly unpopular in the current economic climate . <p> People use electricity around the clock , so electricity transmission and storage must be kept in mind as key players. - Smart grids will require advanced utility-scale batteries to store electricity so it can be delivered when needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage technologies ? <p> In the UK , the DECC has been running a programme funded by public money that looks at various energy-storage solutions that could be used in the national grid . At the moment there is no obvious solution as everything from compressed air storage to molten salt and battery power is being considered . <p> The UK does have- pumped storage ( hydroelectric ) , but not on a scale seen in countries like Norway and Canada , which make use of their natural topography . 
@@36748981 @5748981/ <h> Recycling domestic sewage <p> Water is becoming an absolutely key resource in the UK , especially in the south and the east of the country . With supply limited as a result of- increased frequency of droughts , and- ever increasing volumes of water demanded , recycling water is imperative to ensure supply can still meet demand . Recycling domestic sewage is one way of- recycling- water , and this also has the added benefit of cutting- the cost of industrial sewage treatment processes . Domestic sewage treatment is a relatively simple process and is described in detail below , - however first it is important to make the distinction between greywater and blackwater . <p> Greywater is- the wastewater that comes from showers , washing machines , and sinks . It may- have- particles and contaminants but they are not- dangerous . <p> Blackwater- is sewage- wastewater- from toilets or dishwashers and can contain food particles , faeces , and other human bodily fluids which are considered hazardous both to the individual and , if released into the ground , soil . <p> Currently it is normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is treated by properly installed sewage treatment works . <p> Current practices are based , understandably , on assumptions of hygiene issues .

However , there are reliable systems now that act as- hygienic domestic- sewage treatment works , - filtering the blackwater- sufficiently so that it can- be used outdoors in watering lawns and plants . <p> Top of the range systems are available- that- can even filter- blackwater to purity levels that make it fine for human consumption . However these- systems come at a- very high cost with high associated- maintenance costs . There is also a certain stigma- attached to this , with people uneasy about- drinking ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for removing usable water from blackwater sits externally to the house . Water is piped to it , and then it goes through a process before being used to water the lawn or non-food gardens via underground pipe systems . As discussed above , unless you have a top of the range domestic- sewage treatment works in your back garden , the recycled water- from blackwater is not normally suitable- for- drinking . If you intend to- use the water in the garden , it is advisable not to use this water on- edible- crops because it could still contain harmful bacteria , which poses a- danger to the individual . <h> The blackwater filtering process <p> The following section looks at five steps involved in the filtration process , that takes place as part of your domestic sewage treatment works . <h> The primary tank <p> This where the sewage wastewater initially runs into as it flows from the home via gravity and pipes . Here , the sewage sits for a period of time , usually 24 hours , while large volume of bacteria works to break down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blackwater is pumped to the secondary tank . <h> The secondary tank <p> When the settled blackwater is pumped away from the primary tank , it goes into the secondary treatment tank . This tank is then further- separated into three stages to help with the continuing processes . <h> Ventilation stage <p> The first chamber in the secondary treatment tank begins the ventilation- stage . This is where water and air are injected into the tank at timed intervals so that the tank contents are churned . Bacteria in the tank then settle so they can feed on the sludge in the tank . When this is complete , the water is moved to the sludge settling chamber . <h> Sludge settling chamber <p> The water that is piped from the ventilation- chamber ends up in the sludge settling chamber . A bacteria biomass mechanism forces sludge downwards and the partially treated water upwards to be collected and sent on to the irrigation chamber stage . <h> Irrigation chamber <p> When the water is piped out of the sludge settling chamber , it is eventually pushed into the irrigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is the last step of the process . The water can then be piped out of the system and sprinkled on plants in the garden . <h> Final thoughts on treating blackwater <p> There is certainly a stigma of drinking treated blackwater , however recycling water is an important aspect of a more sustainable life , even if the- water is only to be- used in the garden. - In April 2012 , the UK suffered- a- hosepipe ban- due to lack of rainfall over the prior couple of winters . In fact it was noted that the- preceding- 18 months were the driest on record for more than a century . Therefore we all need to do our bit and try to use less water , or recycle more of the water we use so recycling- blackwater is a great way to help this cause . <p> The fact that many off-grid ' remote places- already operate their own domestic sewage treatment works in their back garden shows that this technology is reliable and proven , therefore this technology may be suitable for- installation for the home or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . <h> Benefits <p> Water conservation using recycled blackwater to water lawns and non-food gardens conserves fresh water .

This saves energy upfront and removes harmful bacteria . <p> Habitat protection when blackwater is recycled near source , it lowers the risk of waste water seeping into natural habitats on the way to a treatment plant . <p> Plant growth the plants that are grown with recycled blackwater rarely need any fertiliser because the water is rich in nutrients and plants feed off this . 184564 @qwx384564 <p> Blackwater recycling systems are expensive " installation , maintenance and repair costs are high .

@@36748984 @5748984/ <h> Micro Hydroelectric Power <h> Renewables <h> Hydroelectric power on a residential scale <p> It is well known that energy is generated by building dams over giant underwater turbines ; however it is possible to use micro hydro generators ( &lt;100kW ) or pico hydro generators ( &lt;5kW ) - on more modest water flows .

The larger the distance that the water falls before it hits the blade , the higher the head . Ideally both the flow and the head will be high , however if one of these is particularly high , while the other is low there is still the potential for a rich source of electricity . <p> You can estimate the number of kilowatts of energy produced by multiplying the flow ( litres/sec ) - by the head ( m ) - and multiplying by 9.81 ( gravitational constant ) . Remember a typical house uses 4500kWh- per year . <h> How does micro hydroelectric work ? <p> The type of turbine that is used varies depending on the type of flow available , however typically a residential generator uses a pipe to collect water from a river or a stream . Using gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generator situated within the pipe acts to change the kinetic energy from the water flow into electrical energy . <p> When you have high head- ( the vertical distance from the water source to the generator ) , - you are best using an impulse turbine ( such as a Pelton turbine ) .

This- jet of water is directed at the buckets , and the force of the the water causes the turbine to spin generating the power . The smallest type of high head turbine requires a head of at least 10-14 metres , and a water flow of 3-4 litres/ second , and this is rated at producing 200- watts of power . <p> For medium head water flows , it is best to use a reaction turbine .

Obviously as with the high head turbines , if either the head or the flow increases , you will see dramatic increases in the potential- electricity- your system is capable of- generating . <p> For low head water flows , you obviously require a high flow rate , and in this situation an old style water wheel is the best . So the water fills the buckets which fill up , then pulling the wheel down , so the next bucket is filled , and this process is continued so the wheel spins ( albeit very slowly ) . However the advantage of- this type of system is that any potential blockages just simply wash through the system . Gearing can be used in conjunction with water wheels to increase the speed that the generator spins to help- electricity- production .

Initially the room was retrofitted with insulation , in the roof space , walls and floors to bring the heat demand of the property down . Insulation should always be the first step for homes and businesses before heating systems are looked at . Insulation reduces draughts and increases the heat retention of the property . <p> Having completely refurbished the garden room , the Muspratts came to TheGreenAge to talk a little bit more about infrared heating . Initially infrared heating appealed very much because - it is easy to install , it can be installed on the ceilings , therefore blending unnoticed in the environment and the heat is drying and low cost to run . <h> The infrared heating panel solution <p> Having shared the floor plans of the property , the team helped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointed in the heating output . It is very important to size them correctly , because if you go too low then the heating output will not be adequate enough and you may be disappointed .

If you have uninsulated solid walls or unfilled cavities , then you many need to accommodate 100 150 watts per m2 . <p> The Muspratts went for three 850watt carbon fibre panels to heat an area of approximately 40m2 . Although they were slightly oversized , it is not a bad thing because the room would get to target temperature much quicker and therefore reduce the frequent thirst for electricity to power it . <h> Installation of the heaters <p> The heaters themselves were installed as part of the general retrofit of the property .

The heat demand of the property therefore is not nearly as big as an equivalent solid wall property and since the house was mid-terrace there is very little heat loss with their neighbours and likewise through the ceiling because there is another flat above , however the heat demand is far higher than a house built today to building regulations . <p> Since the house did n't  have access to mains gas , a new central heating system was not possible , therefore efficient- heating- options were limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source heat pump ( which would of allowed them access to the Renewable Heat incentive ) , infrared heating or fan assisted storage heaters . <h> Why install Infrared in the home ? <p> Mr Anderson was extremely keen to go down the infrared heating route for a number of reasons firstly the panels are thin- and therefore do n't  steal space in a room ( they stick out just over 2.5cm from the wall once installed ) , secondly the warmth they can produce can be felt far quicker than traditional heating systems and therefore are more cost effective since the heating does n't  need to be on as long . Lastly the panels look rather slick compared to other types of heating system . <h> How did- he go about the change to Infrared ? <p> We received the floor plan through from Mr Anderson so we could accurately size the panels based on his specific requirements. - We recommended 4 panels , one for each bedroom , one for the lounge and a final one in the corridor , each with their own thermostat ( to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to supplying the panels , we were also able to get one of our approved electrician partners to carry out the install in the home , which took just 1 day .

In practice a flat roof is pretty easy to spot because essentially it is horizontal . Also flat roofs do n't tend to have the loft space that you normally associate with pitched roofs , so on the whole they wo n't have the loft hatch in the ceiling . <p> Therefore in insulated flat roofs , the insulating materials are laid between your ceiling and the roof membrane to prevent heat from escaping or coming into your property . <h> How good is my flat roof insulation ? <p> Flat roofs have been common in construction for the last 150 years . From the 1950s right up to the 1970s flat roof properties and flats were quite popular , many were built and are therefore found throughout the UK . If you have a period property you may have a split roof for example ; where the front is sloping with loft access and the back is flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrace or an inaccessible roof space . <p> Unfortunately , in the past installing insulation was n't really high on the agenda when it came to building flat roofs .

In the summer , the opposite is true ; the room could be like a sun room , where if the sun shines , it gets unbearably hot and sticky . <p> These extremes are exaggerated if that room or side of the property is northerly facing , so in the winter with a lack of infrared heat intensity it will feel colder than other rooms . In the summer if the room is southerly facing , which typically gets more sun intensity then the room will feel too hot relative to the rest of the property . <p> Even if the roof has recently had the membrane or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is fairly unlikely that any insulation would have been retrofitted unless it was specifically requested for . <h> What is the current building regulation for flat roof insulation ? <p> The current building regulations with respect to U values for flat roof insulation was updated in 2010 , following on from the 2006 implemented changes to Building Regulations Approved Document L ( Conservation of fuel and power ) . - The current target U-value for new or replacement flat roofs should be 0.18W/m-K . This has been lowered over the years for two reasons , firstly more insulation means better heat retention and therefore lower bills and secondly to help meet the CO2 emission reduction EU directive . <h> How to insulate your flat roof ? <p> Before we begin explaining about the ways to do this , it is vital you do n't attempt any of these improvements yourself they should be carried out by a professional contractor . <h> Warm deck insulation ( warm roof ) <p> As the diagram shows this involves putting in the insulating materials on top of the roof . The process starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the waterproof roof membrane . Doing this protects those layers underneath from the extreme weather elements . <p> Once the layer of insulation is added a layer of asphalt is laid out on the top to finish the job . The flat roof can have many uses after that , for example from laying a layer of gravel to actually adding soil and plants . <p> Warm roof is the best way to insulate your flat roof as there are no condensation issues to contend with . <p> Finally depending on the make-up of your property and the access to the flat roof , be prepared to factor in the cost of scaffolding . <h> Cold roof insulation <p> This is the most common way people have their flat roof insulated , which involves placing the insulating material between the joist spaces that support the roof structure . The material has to be laid carefully so that a gap of 50-60mm is left between the roof material and the insulation , to allow air to flow through the structure .

Her health issues means she lives a fairly sedentary lifestyle and- because she 's not moving around much , she says she often feels cold . As a result , she spends loads of money on heating , which leaks out of her home and constantly needs topping up . Phyllis had a small amount of- insulation in the loft already ( about 100mm ) , but it was in disrepair and needed topping up . <p> Phyllis- said shed looked into getting double glazing upstairs but had been quoted over -4,000 so was looking for other- measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of a no-brainer . <p> Loft insulation is quick and easy to install , but it is a really effective way to keep your house warm and save you money on energy bills . Obviously , heat rises , and without a barrier it can go straight up and out of your roof . Loft insulation- can stop up to 20% of your heating escaping . <p> We choose- Knauf Earthwool as the material to insulate the loft ; it is a flexible glass mineral wool quilt which is lightweight , resilient- and non-combustible . Unfortunately like most loft insulation it is still really itchy , so before we started the job we suited up to try and minimise the contact of the wool with our skin . The aim was to add an additional 200mm of this insulation on top of the old insulation to produce a nice 300mm thick blanket in Phylliss loft . <p> The job was finished- in less than 2 hours and we left a happy customer who will hopefully feel an instant difference in the warmth of her home ! <h> 2 comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits for your home and your pocket ! You will prevent up to one half of the heat generated in your home from disappearing through the roof . You could save up to -110 each year on an ongoing basis by simply installing a few rolls of loft insulation . Also , gas and electricity costs will reduce.Government or energy company grants could mean that you can have loft insulation either cheaper or for free.Your home will be producing less carbon , saving the environment and could even be warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer .

@@36748989 @5748989/ <h> Geothermal Power <h> Renewables <h> What is Geothermal Power ? <p> Geothermal power is utilising energy that comes in the form of heat from beneath the earth 's crust/- surface layer . Essentially this is utilising the same scientific principles as used in- ground source heat pumps , but on an- industrial scale . Geothermal power relies on large generators and infrastructure that can provide both heat and electricity to multiple dwellings and commercial properties . <p> Geothermal power is a renewable heat source that can provide energy for electricity production as well as heating for a number of applications and appliances . Currently in the UK there is one working geothermal power plant in Southampton , which is providing a local district heating solution rather than being used an electricity generating power plant . <p> Some areas of the world have much more geothermal activity ( such as Iceland , West Coast of the US , Rotorua in New Zealand , etc. ) , and these are more obvious places to harness the earth 's geothermal power . However , if you dig deep enough , heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) so we could definitely roll out this technology more , and build on expertise to harvest the heat in more effective ways . <p> The science behind geothermal power is relatively simple ; heat is continuously flowing from the Earth 's core by conduction ( travelling from hot to cold ) to the surface and is therefore considered as renewable source as long as the Earth continues to have an active core . It is estimated that geothermal power could produce 44million MWs of power , so even if we could tap a very small percentage of this it would service most of our energy needs . <h> Geothermal Power for Electricity Generation <p> Utilising geothermal power requires accessing high temperature fluid that is heated deep underground . Historically this fluid has existed underground , formed by rainwater passing through cracks in the crust . The water is heated by hot rock underneath and compressed by pressure that maintain it its liquid form . The water potentially then finds a path through the Earth 's crust , and presents itself on the surface as hot water springs or geysers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon , we can also artificially mimic this by pumping cold surface water down into the earth 's crust , where it gets superheated and returns to the surface via circulation pumps . Existing Geothermal Power plants have either tapped into the naturally occurring process or mimicked this to produce the steam necessary to drive turbines to create electricity . As we can now have the technology to drill deeper than ever into the Earth 's crust , by utilising the man made process , we can implement geothermal power stations anywhere in the world . <h> Three common Geothermal Power generating systems <h> Dry Steam Geothermal Power <p> Dry steam geothermal power plants use geothermal steam directly to turn the electricity producing turbines . To have this structure in place requires steam directly travelling to the Earth 's surface , which is quite a rare phenomenon , so there are only few examples of this type of power station worldwide . The geothermal steam , which is superheated ( above 1000C ) is forced up through cracks in the ground under great pressure . The pressure of hot steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbines . The turbines drive a generator , which creates the electrical charge . Hot steam is then cooled in a cold heat exchanger and the cold water is then pumped back into the ground , which then kicks off this cycle again . <h> Flash System Geothermal Power <p> Flash steam geothermal power plants rely on highly pressurised , superheated water instead of steam . The highly pressurised liquid is pushed through a series of pressure tanks . In turn , these holding tanks reduce the pressure of the liquid , allowing it to turn into steam . This process is repeated several times in different depressurised chambers with the steam then collected and ' flashed ' through to drive a turbine generator system to create electricity . As with the dry steam geothermal power system , the excess hot liquid is cooled and / or condensed and then pumped back into the ground so the liquid is replenished . <h> Binary Cycle Geothermal Power <p> Binary cycle geothermal power plants use lower temperatures to produce energy and use technology much like that used in- OTEC , using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammonium and/ or propane into steam to drive the electro generating system . This type of system can be implemented using lower ground temperature as a working fluid has a lower boiling point than water . Once the working fluid passes through the turbine shafts , it is condensed back into the liquid and reused over and over again . <h> Geothermal Power for Heating <p> We have talked a lot about electricity generation in the above section , however geothermal power can also be used for heating solutions . Like- ground source heat pump- systems used in the home , a geothermal power system can be implemented as a district heating solution . In the UK , this would be optimal in areas that are not covered by the current gas grid . Using residual heat from the dry steam or flash system geothermal processes , local homes and businesses could be supplied with heat all year round . <p> The slight issue in the UK , is that the infrastructure requires investment by the generation companies to make this a feasible proposition , it would however allow them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consumers . These types of solutions are currently more common in Scandinavian countries , and therefore the UK is playing catch up as far as geothermal power goes . <h> Where is Geothermal Power now ? <p> In the UK , there is enthusiasm about the prospects of geothermal power , but thus far- DECC- has not provided the additional support that the technology really needs to make a suitable foothold . Currently geothermal power qualifies for two- Renewable Obligation Certificates ( ROCs ) per MWh of electricity generated , but the investment community believe this support should be closer to four ROCs , so that investment does n't go to other parts of Europe like Germany . <p> Geothermal power electricity is currently produced in 24 countries across the planet with the total combined installed capacity being approximately 10,715MW . The largest capacity is in the USA ( 3.1GW installed in 2010 ) , however by 2015 this is expected to increase by 75% , taking installed capacity to 18.5GW . Geothermal power as a heating solution is much more widespread , and currently used in over 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world at present is the Calpine Corporation which taps geothermal electricity primarily in the geysers in California . The 19 geothermal power plants it has in this location provide 25% of the green energy to California .

@@36748990 @5748990/ <h> What are the benefits of rooflights ? <h> April 8 , 2016 <h> What are rooflights ? <p> Rooflights are effectively windows in the roof of your property , which allow natural light into the building . In this blog we are going to look at some of the benefits of rooflights and why and where they might be installed . <h> Where can you install rooflights ? <p> You will generally see rooflights in large commercial properties like warehouses and offices . Where you have a high ceiling and a ceiling without a loft space , a rooflight is an option . <h> Rooflights reduce your lighting bill and cut CO2 emissions <p> One of the key benefits of rooflights is that they help cut your lighting bill . In a busy warehouse or office , you are going to need a good high quality light throughout the day . In a larger building , you are may be a fair way from an exterior wall with a window and this is unlikely to provide all the light that you need , even during the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to central spaces within a building , taking advantage of those large spaces to help distribute light across the floor of warehouses or open plan offices . Remember that this light is free and wo n't cost you any money unlike an electric lamp . <h> Rooflights give quality daylight <p> A growing concern that has received a lot of press coverage : many members of the country 's workforce do n't get enough daylight when they are working in the office . Many older buildings were built without sufficient glazing in an effort to improve efficiency and cut costs , or were poorly designed so that offices were in parts of the building far away from external walls . <p> Daylight is really important as it helps regulate the body clock , is important for mental wellbeing and can have physical health benefits as well . There are various studies which show the benefits of a well-lit office with plenty of natural light . <h> U-values of rooflights <p> Rooflights have the same regulations as windows that govern their performance and installation . Rooflights and windows need to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door or window . For England and Wales that means 2.2W/m2K for new build non-domestic buildings and 1.8W/m2K for existing non-domestic buildings . These figures are even lower for dwellings . <p> One thing to bear in mind is that your roof itself will have a much better U-value than your rooflight , with performance down below 0.16W/m2K as a typical value for a roof . This means that the more rooflights you have , the lower the performance of your roof relative to a standard roof . <h> How many rooflights ? <p> Does this mean that there is going to be a trade-off between performance of the roof as a whole and the amount of natural light you can get into the room ? The answer is somewhat muddied by the added component of solar gain . Solar gain is the heat you get from the sun that has been amplified though glass something I 'm sure most people notice when they stand in front of a window on a sunny day . This can be particularly powerful on bright days and is the reason greenhouses often feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a heating system . <p> Which of these properties of rooflights is going to be the dominant force ? The solar gain warming the room , or the heat loss as a result of their lower U-value ? This is impossible to answer in general terms . Let 's take a couple of examples to show why there is no one size fits all answer . <h> Example 1 " A Warehouse <p> Warehouses often require little or no heating , and therefore their roofs are often poorly insulated or not insulated at all . Lighting will be a much more important part of the bill , because large enclosed spaces require a lot of light . Because of the large open space inside , rooflights offer a great way to reduce the amount of daytime artificial light required , and with few downsides in this scenario , warehouses will often have a high proportion of rooflights . It is not uncommon to see 20% of the total roof area covered with them . They are also very cheap to install because in an unheated environment they do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environments . <h> Example 2 " A 9 to 5 Office <p> In the average office that operates predominantly in daylight hours , you are going to get a lot of positive solar gain from your rooflights , and during the brighter daylight hours , this is going to far outweigh the losses from the rooflights themselves . While there will be heat loss at night , when there is no solar gain , the office wo n't need to be heated at this time . So rooflights are always going to be a net benefit , if you are fortunate enough to have an office that can accommodate them . Light is also at a premium in office spaces , so any way to boost this without adding more artificial light is going to be a bonus . <h> Example 3 " A 24 Hour Store <p> Another place you tend to see rooflights is in large shops or supermarkets " perhaps even a shopping centre . In this scenario , the space is going to be used , if not 24/7 , then very close to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building is in constant use , the solar gain during the day is going to be somewhat offset by the losses in heat through the rooflight during the night time . <p> There are plenty more examples where rooflights are going to be beneficial , so if you have a roof that will allow rooflights to be installed , you should really think about them as a positive move for your property . <h> Installing new windows map . 184568 @qwx384568 <p> Need new windows ? <p> Fill in your details and we 'll be in touch ! 184572 @qwx384572

Whilst hydrologists claim that some parts of the country are faced with shortages of water , in reality this should n't be a problem in most parts of the country . <h> What do I need to have to access water off-grid ? <p> Essentially , you can provide your home with a private water supply , and the first step is to get your hands on a hydro-geology report that will tell you how deep you will have to drill in your local area . You can hire out a private borehole contractor who will use a specialist machine to dig into the ground until they reach the water table or ground water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aquifer the borehole must be lined .

So , there is a perceived lack of ability to be able to generate enough off-grid/renewable energy to be able to fully power your home ( unless you use diesel generators , which would not only be expensive to run but very bad for the environment ) . <p> In addition to the generation side , you need- a consistent and uninterrupted supply of electricity to power all your needs in an off-grid environment ; therefore you will need battery storage .

Energy production works in two ways : at high tide , a barrier goes up and water rushes into the lagoon through turbines , generating kinetic energy . At low tide , water that has built up inside the lagoon does the same on its way out .

This is important because it means that we do n't have to ensure a constant supply of electricity into the National Grid . With carbon reduction targets getting stronger , the price of imported gas volatile , and coal power no longer viable in the UK , moving to a future centred on renewable energy is more important than ever . <p> Battery storage technology has now finally got to a point where we can expect within the next few years to see it used both for managing whole countries ' energy stores , and on a commercial level .

@@36748996 @5748996/ <h> 10 Reasons to use Rockwool Insulation in your home <h> September 16 , 2015 <p> If you are insulating the walls of your home there are a few different materials you can use . One material that is growing in popularity is Rockwool " which like the name suggests is wool made from molten rock . A mixture of basalt , anorthosite , and cemented briquettes are heated up in excess of 15000c at which the rock mixture becomes molten and this is then spun into fibres . A binder and mineral oil are then added which stabilises the spun rock wool fibres and also makes them water repellant . <p> Rockwool is comparable with EPS in terms of its insulating ability , but there are a few reasons why architects often specify it when they are designing builds . <p> Its high thermal efficiency reduces energy bills for heating and cooling in residential buildings due to the outstanding thermal resistance of the wool . The thermal resistance of a construction material is measured by what 's known as the R-value , with a higher number indicating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S Department of Energy , fibreglass offers an R-value of 2.2 to 2.7 per inch , while Rockwool has an R-value of 3.0 to 3.3 per inch . <p> Rockwool offers noise insulation due to its innovative materials that have higher densities and random fibre standard orientation that trap sound waves and deadens vibration time . For this reason it is perfect choice for spaces where the occupants are looking to minimise noise such as offices , bedrooms , meeting rooms or accommodation close to busy roads . <p> It offers fire protection to the building and improved safety because it is made of rock that is fire resistant . <p> Rockwool is a breathable material allowing moisture to escape from the construction . This reduces the risk of mould and bacterial growth on the inside of the property . <p> It constitutes a compression-resistant material that can be used as roofing boards or bonded panels . So it is ideal for thermal applications on domestic buildings such as extensions and loft conversions .

So there is no need for maintenance increasing the payback time of the intervention . <p> It has minimum environmental impact because it reduces carbon footprint due to its natural origin and hazardous-free classifications that offer minimum embodied carbon . Additionally , it reduces the use of non-renewable energy sources such as gas and electricity contributing to air pollution reduction . <p> Rockwool itself is sourced from natural and sustainable raw materials and perhaps more importantly it can be completely recycled when the building is no longer in use without producing waste " All of the Rockwool waste can be reused as a raw material in the manufacturing process , producing brand new insulation .

In essence , it performs the same function as a boiler would in a central heating system , generating heat to be used for heating and water . For those off the gas grid , its a much cheaper option than storage heaters or electric radiators but increasing numbers of people with access to mains gas are also installing the measure . <p> A heat pump- has less environmental- impact than other forms of heating such as gas or oil , as no fossil fuels are burned , apart from in generating the- electricity that powers the pump . They 're also one of the most efficient ways to heat your home and water . <p> Although some people are put off by the upfront cost of installation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government- Renewable Heat Incentive scheme . <h> How does a ground source heat pump work ? <p> Put very simply , a ground source heat pump takes heat from below ground and feeds it through a converter to boost its temperature . The heat generated can then be used to provide space or water heating . <p> Pipes are buried deep in the ground . Heat transfer liquid travels through pipework and absorbs ambient heat from the ground . The liquid passes through a heat exchanger , which removes the heat from the liquid . The heat then goes through a compressor , where it is boosted to a useable temperature . This circuit- repeats continuously . <p> Ground source heat pumps run equally efficiently all year round , unlike air source heat pumps , because the temperature underground remains relatively constant throughout different seasons/weather . The only environmental impact is generating the ( relatively small amount of ) electricity that powers the pump . <h> Installing a ground source heat pump <p> First , you have to choose between laying pipes in deep vertical boreholes or shallow horizontal trenches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much space you have outdoors . You will need a certain amount of pipework in order for the heat pump to work efficiently , and if you cant go sideways , you 'll have to go down ! - In one scenario , pipes- are laid horizontally in 2-3m-deep trenches over a large surface area to give the heat transfer liquid more chance to pick up as much heat as possible from the ground . Boreholes are drilled down as far as 100m or more , meaning they are much more expensive ( but might be the only option in some cases ) . <p> The length of the ground loop you need to install depends on how much heat you require ( which depends on the size of your home/inhabitants ) . The longer the loop , the more heat the pipework can draw from the ground , and the more efficient the system will be but more digging means- more disruption and higher costs . <p> Its important to use- an MCS-approved installer . If you do n't  , you ca n't claim RHI payments , and incorrect installation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs <p> Ground source heat pumps- run on electricity , which is more expensive per unit than gas but do n't  let this put you off . They are very efficient . Each unit of electricity ( required to run the pump and compressor ) turns into 3.5 " 4.5 units of useful heat . To put this into perspective , a brand new energy efficient boiler will- convert one- unit of gas into just 0.9 units of useful heat. - So the running costs of this technology are pretty cheap . <p> Installing a system normally costs -12-20,000 as mentioned before , - costs vary a lot depending on how much- digging needs to be done ! You- can claim back a considerable chunk of this from the RHI. - However , because it gives you quarterly payments over 7 years , you 'll still need the initial capital to invest to cover buying it and installation costs . <p> How much you 'll get in RHI payments depends on a number of factors , including whether or not your house is detached and what heating system you currently have installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump would have , the bigger the contribution you will get .

In this blog , we are going to take you through the various electric boilers available and the benefits and downsides to them . <h> Direct Acting Electric Boilers <p> These are the simplest type of electric boiler available , and they will also be the least expensive to install . The direct acting boiler heats the water using an element , and this hot water could be part of a central heating system , or for hot water . There is not a storage system with this type of boiler , so the water is heated on demand , like a combi boiler . Whilst this is very efficient , it does mean that you can not benefit from economy 7 tariffs by storing cheaply heated water at night for using during peak hours of the day . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate hot water cylinder , or a built in storage unit . The advantage of these systems over direct acting boilers is that any heated water can be stored to be used later , and the user can therefore take advantage of time of use tariffs ' like economy 7 . The disadvantage is that they obviously are going to take up more room than a direct acting boiler , and will set you back a bit more . <h> Electric CPSU <p> CPSU stands for Combined Primary Storage Unit and the key feature of this type of boiler is that a large volume of water is stored by the boiler itself . This means that a CPSU can release hot water to the radiators or the taps extremely quickly " much faster than a standard boiler . It is used to dealing with higher volumes and higher pressures . These boilers can be found in domestic properties , but they are more popular with commercial applications . They do take up space , but are great if you need instant hot water in larger volumes than a standard combi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same principle as storage heaters . Storage heaters utlise cheap electricity at night by storing heat in bricks . This heat can then be used during the day , when prices are higher to heat a room . <p> Dry core boilers will store heat in bricks in the same way , but the heat is released as needed into water , which can then be used for central heating or hot water . This makes them much more versatile than a storage heater , with some of the advantages that a boiler has . <h> Storage or no storage ? <p> This seems to be the main question when you are opting for an electric boiler . Storage is an advantage because it allows you to use cheap night tariffs , but it can also be bulky and more expensive to install . If you are opting for electric heating , a modern storage heater will be just as efficient as a electric wet central heating system , and much cheaper , so it might not be right for many people . The advantage of course is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hot water and heating running from the same system . <h> Combining solar with electric boilers <p> Since electric boiler use electricity to operate and solar PV generates electricity , it is possible to use a PV system to help heat your water . Of course , you are only able to heat your water with solar during the day time , but with a storage system , this should not be a big problem . <h> What electric boiler ? <p> If you are set on an electric boiler , there are a few different options available to you . Obviously , gas is going to be the cheaper option , but if you do n't have gas , but want all the benefits of a central heating system , then an electric boiler is a viable option . We recommend you take a look at alternative forms of electric heating as well before you make your decision . This includes storage heaters and infrared heating . 
@@36749001 @5749001/ <h> Energy storage <h> Energy Management <h> What is battery storage ? <p> Both solar and wind turbines can be described as intermittent energy sources . Yes they are renewable ( which means they are clean sources of power ) but if the sun does n't  shine or the wind does n't  blow then unfortunately no energy is produced . Battery storage is a means of storing the electrical energy for use at a later time or date as and when it is needed . <p> With battery storage , - electrical energy is stored as chemical energy so that it can be used at a- later point . The benefits of this are twofold : <p> On a national level , battery storage systems will help with- managing electricity demand . <p> On a personal level , those who install the systems could save money on their bills . <p> These systems have been around for a few years , and until recently have been used mainly by those with home renewables . While generating your own solar electricity has many benefits , there has always been one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per day . Clearly , - solar PV only produces electricity when the sun is shining . Until battery storage came along , there was no way to store your electricity , so it got sent- to the National Grid . The new technology maximises the amount of money you can save , by allowing you to use as much of your own ( free ) energy as possible and minimising your reliance on exporting it from the Grid . <p> A new market is now opening- up following the introduction of time of use tariffs in the UK . These open the door for charging- batteries at cheap times of the day and using the electricity- later , during peak times when electricity from the Grid is more expensive . <p> As technology improves and battery storage systems start to be manufactured on a bigger scale , the price will drop and they will be available to more people . <h> Types of battery <p> You have 3 choices at the moment when installing a battery storage system for your home : <p> Lead acid battery <p> This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintenance than other types , - are limited on the number of charging cycles they can handle before they need replacing . <p> Lithium ion battery <p> These are the current favourites used by leading battery manufacturers including Tesla . They are marginally more expensive than lead acid batteries but can be charged and discharged far more , meaning they last longer . They are also maintenance-free and take up less space . <p> Flow battery <p> This type of battery is still in development , and could be the future of battery storage . Theoretically , flow batteries can be charged and discharged an infinite number of times . But they are expensive about twice the price of lithium ion batteries -and they take up a lot of space because they- normally- require ancillary equipment such as pumps , sensors , control units and secondary containment vessels . <h> What is a solar- battery management system ? <p> Alongside your battery , you will need a- battery management system . A BMS keeps track of the workings of your battery storage system such as temperature , voltages and currents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will use your electricity differently on weekdays and weekends , and a- BMS can manage- this for you . <h> Which solar battery storage system should I buy ? <p> The number of battery storage systems on the market is increasing by the day . They vary a lot , and it is really worth doing your research to find the best match for you . The bigger the system , the more expensive it will be , so there 's no point buying one that you 're never going to charge fully . <p> Get an expert to help you set up your system you 'll need a bit of forward-planning to ensure you are making the most of it . <h> Can I go off-grid with a battery storage system ? <p> Its theoretically possible , but youd need a massive battery system and pretty huge amounts of energy generation . Youd also have to be very organised about when you used the batteries . If you have solar PV , for instance , there could easily be a few days in a row with little sunshine , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deficit . <p> With battery storage , you can definitely- use a lot of your own energy , but for most people it will probably be a supplementary/back-up system for renewables , rather than their only energy source . <h> Installing battery storage <p> Interested in having a battery storage system installed in your home ? We have scoured the can find one of these tradesmen on our easy to use local installer map . 184565 @qwx384565 <p> I am interested in getting a battery storage system for my home . I have 4.5kW solar system on my roof . I think it is about 18 panels . Which battery storage system would be best suited for this ? I currently make about 4,000 kWh per year but most obviously during the summer months when the sun is shinning . Ideally I want to be able to use the electricity I produce during the day when we get home from work to help lower our energy bills a bit 
@@36749002 @5749002/ <h> Time of use tariffs <p> Time of use tariffs are a new concept , designed to incentivise customers to use more energy at off-peak times , in order to balance demand . These tariffs charge cheaper rates at certain times of- night or day , when demand is at its lowest , and higher rates at popular times . The benefits are two-fold : - demand is managed and customers can lower their bills . <h> Why have time of use tariffs been introduced ? <p> In terms of energy generation , the UKs future is uncertain . Closing coal power plants to help meet the countrys carbon reduction targets has had a big impact on- the amounts of energy the UK is able to generate . With very little investment in other forms of energy , such as renewable sources , experts are predicting energy shortages in the years to come . Time of use tariffs could have a big role to play in reducing demand , and therefore lessening the pressure on UK energy infrastructure . <h> How are time of use tariffs different from Economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different to Economy 7 . Economy 7 was introduced to encourage people to charge storage heaters at night , using electricity that would otherwise be wasted . Coal and nuclear plants which the UK has traditionally drawn most of its power from can not be turned off at night , and are therefore inefficient unless people use- this electricity . <p> The big difference with Economy 7 is that it only has one cheap rate , at night . Time of use tariffs have several different rates , increasing the potential amount of energy and money that can be saved . <p> Something else to take into account is that Economy 7 is not expected to be offered- for much longer , as the coal plants it was designed to work alongside are being decommissioned . <p> The only- form of heating that works with Economy 7 is storage heaters ( which are inefficient and difficult to use ) , whereas- any form of heating or appliance can be run on a time of use tariff . <h> Do I need a smart meter for- a time of use tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real-time information on how much energy you are using , and sends it- automatically to your energy provider . If you do n't  have a smart meter , they cant know when you are using your energy , and therefore how much to charge you for it . <p> A national rollout is now underway , with every household that does n't  opt out expected to have one by 2020 . Energy companies install them free of charge and <p> There are other benefits of smart meters , because you can track your costs as you go , meaning no nasty surprises when your bills come through at the end of the month . There are no more estimated bills , so you wont be overcharged . You also no longer have to send readings yourself . <h> How many time of use tariffs are available ? <p> At the moment , there is only one Green Energy UKs Tide tariff . Green Energy UK is somewhat of a pioneer these days , with 100% of their energy generated from renewable sources , and their tariff leading the way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been installed in the majority of homes , - most energy companies are expected to start offering the new tariffs . <h> How much money could I save on a time of use tariff ? <p> Quite a lot , if you use it cleverly . Let us explain Green Energy UK 's Tide tariff , for instance , offers electricity at 20p cheaper per unit overnight . With the average hourly electricity rate in the UK currently around 12p , the 4.99p rate offered between the hours of 11pm and 6am each night is pretty tempting ! You may wonder what the point is in offering electricity while everyones in bed . Well , - its up to people to change their habits ! Clearly , - people are always going to need to use the washing machine during the day at certain times , but you could start trying to do the bulk of your washing at night . The same goes with running dishwashers , bread machines etc .. You get the picture ! <h> Time of use tariffs the future <p> All in all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean lower bills for customers and less pressure on UK infrastructure . People running- their most power-hungry appliances at night could really lessen strain on the National Grid . Reducing power surges will avoid blackouts and hopefully ensure a constant supply of energy , at a point where the future of energy supply in the UK is looking a bit shaky . <p> Something that could greatly affect the way people use time of use tariffs is the ongoing development of battery storage technology . Home battery storage systems help manage demand by making people less reliant on national energy supplies. - Until recently , these systems have been the preserve of people with home renewables , wanting to store the energy they generated to use at a later time . The introduction of time of use tariffs mean these systems could now be worthwhile for anyone . Those on these tariffs can maximise savings by- charging batteries with electricity at the cheap times of day , and then use- it later on , whenever they need it . This could potentially save people hundreds of pounds per year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting demand-balancing reduces strain on the UKs energy supplies 184564 @qwx384564 <p> Currently , only one energy supplier offers this kind of tariff . <p> Requires small behavioural changes from the consumer in order to save money . 184565 @qwx384565 <p> I am interested in time of use tariff since we have just installed a Powervault in our home . We have coupled this with our 4kWh solar system and thus far it seems to be working well . However is there a way that I could pull electricity from the grid at night to charge this ? Then I would have the solar producing most of my evening electricity . This would discharge the battery by say 10pm in the evening and then I could use a timer to recharge the battery over night , so come the morning it is full again and then the battery would recharge during the day time . It seems a really good set up = and almost makes me dependant from the grid .

The motion of each section flexing relative to one another results in high pressure oil passing through hydraulic motors driving electrical generators which are linked to the grid through cables along the seabed . At a cost of approximately $11.5million , the three Pelamis machines had an installed peak capacity of 2.25 MW , which is enough to power approximately 1,600 homes per year . <p> Efforts were taken to minimize the impact on local marine flora and fauna through , for example , a mooring system of embedment anchors , chains and ropes rather than more permanent gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However in November 2008 , technical issues resulted in the machines being brought to shore , and although these technical issues were resolved , the financial crisis sunk the Portuguese electricity utility Enersis ' parent company Babcock &amp; Brown , resulting in the project ending much earlier than planned , and before any more of the anticipated 28 Pelamis machines had been built . <p> Following this disappointment , Pelamis shifted their focus onto a second-generation power generator , the P2 . The P2 is longer and heavier allowing greater energy capture at lower cost per MW . The P2 also has a number of design improvements , increasing the efficiency and reliability . <h> Wave Farm Projects in the UK <p> There are currently two P2s being tested at the European Marine Energy Centre ( EMEC ) in the Orkneys , one being owned by E.ON , and the other by ScottishPower Renewables .

As above , this project is dependent on the outcomes of the P2 testing in the Orkneys . <p> Portugal are especially hopeful that this follow-up project will be successful as wave power is going to be vital in their ambitious plans for 60% of the country 's energy to be from renewable sources by 2020 . Portugal has an extensive coastline , most of which is exposed to the full force of the Atlantic and despite the initial failing of the Agu+adoura Wave Farm , Portuguese energy companies continue to invest in high-tech ocean solutions . 
@@36749004 @5749004/ <h> What are the benefits of saving energy ? <h> January 12 , 2017 <p> Thinking about saving energy can seem like a lot of hassle . For instance , a lot of people will just turn up the thermostat when they think their heating is n't warm enough , rather than taking measures to stop hot air escaping . But once you get into good habits , it 's easy to reduce your energy usage dramatically by adopting simple steps . And there are a lot of benefits of saving energy . <h> Reducing demand <p> There are loads of reasons to manage your energy usage . Aside from reducing damage to the planet , you can save yourself considerable amounts of money and together we could help avoid occasions when supply can not meet demand . Energy is a limited resource and it has long been mismanaged by the UK Government . This will reduce pressure on the UK during uncertain times with approaching energy gap . <h> Reducing bills <p> Saving money is an obvious benefit of cutting energy use . Savings can add up quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulbs . Smarter heating controls and insulation can save even more money . Being less dependent on energy companies can only be good , because energy prices are volatile and can rise at any time . Because you have no control over this , it 's important to keep control of your energy bills as much as you can " by reducing the amount of gas and electricity you use . <h> Reducing environmental impact <p> Some methods of energy generation produces huge amounts of fossil fuels . The less we use , the less we need to generate . This means less damage to the planet . Pollution released from power plants contributes- to climate change . Coal power plants also release- radiation . Another problem with non-renewable energy sources is water usage in the generation process . At a time when droughts are a recurring event in many parts of the world , - it is controversial to use huge amounts of water in this way . <h> Avoiding unsafe technology <p> A considerable amount of the UK 's energy is nuclear , considered by some a clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , nuclear power generation risks huge dangers if things go wrong " and occasionally they do . When nuclear reactors are damaged and release radiation , the effects are felt for decades to come on human health , wildlife and the planet . Although these events are rare , they are not impossible " proven recently by the Fukushima disaster in Japan . <p> This- problem as well as pollution could be avoided if UK moved to renewable energy ; although saving energy where possible would still be important because the weather dependency of wind or solar means it would be hard to rely on a constant supply . <h> Increased thermal comfort <p> Surprisingly , saving energy could also improve the thermal comfort of your home . This is because if you are concentrating on reducing draughts , your home will stay warm with less energy used . Being clever about heating means your rooms will retain heat better , be less draughty , and you 'll be more comfortable . 184565 @qwx384565 <p> Energy savings is definitely on many of our minds , and will continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , it might be time to reconsider getting a new combi replacement , which will be much more energy efficient.According to the Energy Saving Trust , replacing an old gas boiler for an A-rated energy efficient condensing model could help an average household , save up to -300 on their energy bills every year . 
@@36749005 @5749005/ <h> Voltage Optimisers <h> July 7 , 2014 <h> What are Voltage Optimisers ? <p> Typically electricity in the UK is supplied at 242V but most appliances are rated between 217 and 253V . The concept is that if you can reduce the voltage supplied , then there will be reduction in your electricity bill . <p> Voltage optimisers reduce the voltage received by the home , to take it down to the lower limit of the rating . This can reduce energy use and power demand . Some devices have a fixed voltage adjustment whilst others regulate the voltage automatically . The unit sits between the mains electricity supply and the rest of the circuit . <h> Do they save energy ? <p> There is much debate as to whether there are significant energy savings to be made for the average domestic consumer , but the technology is clearly of use if you have very large electricity bills e.g. businesses and industries . <p> In one large-scale pilot , commissioned by VPhase and Scottish and Southern Energy ( SSE ) , the percentage of electrical energy savings seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carbon reduction was estimated as 5.0 tonnes of CO2 per household over the lifetime of the voltage optimiser ( 36 years ) . This 5.2% saving has been debated however , and other smaller studies have show less effective results . <p> In the non-domestic arena , energy savings of up to 15% have been seen , but more commonly the savings are in the region of 10% . The exact savings are determined by the type and relative mix of equipment that consume the power i.e. motors , lighting and heating . <p> However , even at the 10% savings figure , if a business is spending -50,000 a year on electricity then this represents a saving of -5,000 per year " enough to really impact the bottom line for businesses . <h> How do Voltage Optimisers affect appliances ? <p> Voltage optimisers affect appliances in various ways : <p> The use of motors is the largest area where voltage optimisers can make savings . It has been shown that less power is drawn on white goods like fridges and freezers , but only a few percent less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commercial motors . <p> Lighting savings can be made on magnetic ballast or incandescent lighting ( because they become slightly dimmer ) , but there are no savings on LEDs . Converting to LED will save you far more money than any small savings gained by installing a voltage optimiser . <p> Heaters will consume less power using a voltage optimiser , but consequently will produce less heat and therefore no savings are achieved " so in our opinion it is easier to simply turn the thermostat down ! <p> The business case becomes stronger when it emerges that the payback period after installation is typically between 1 to 3 years and 40% . In some areas , grants are even available e.g in Essex 's Low Carbon Business Programme whilst the Carbon Trust offers low-cost financing for energy-efficient technology . The Energy Saving Trust maintains an online database of possible funding sources . <h> Voltage Optimisers and Solar PV <p> If you have a solar PV system , your installer may recommend a voltage optimiser . This is because your PV system can ramp up the voltage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the grid . Unfortunately if it gets too high , the grid could cut you off , because they are obligated to keep the mains voltage below a certain level . The voltage optimiser will help regulate this and ensure you do n't have any difficulties with the generation of electricity . <h> So are Voltage Optimisers Worth It ? <p> Voltage optimisers do make sense " for some properties and businesses where heating is n't the primary use of electricity and motors predominate . They should n't be installed as a matter of course however , and only where they are deemed to make a real impact on your energy use . 184565 @qwx384565 <p> I have a large victorian house , 5 bedsits and my flat .

By insulating some or all of the walls , you slow the movement of heat out of the house which means the heating system needs to work less hard to keep the house warm . <p> In this property in South West London , we wanted to insulate as much of it as possible without changing the appearance at the front of the house .

This solid wall insulation system takes the u-value of the walls from 2.1W/m2k down to just 0.27W/m2k now for most of us who do n't  take in u-value speak that is better than a brand new insulated cavity wall built today to conform with building regulations . The mineral render and Silicon Silicate paint provide a fantastic finish and have a raft of other advantages including the following : <p> Breathable system <p> Impact resistant <p> Durable " the render is 1.5mm thick . <p> Great- value <p> The great thing about the solid wall insulation being applied to the outside of the brick is that this becomes a heat store , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well after the heating has been turned off . <p> The job took just two weeks to carry out , with all the pipework extended to ensure a consistent thickness of insulation across all the walls .

According to the Energy Saving Trust , uninsulated solid walls can account up to 35% of total heat loss , therefore addressing this area can make a big impact on the energy efficiency of the property . <p> The Elsleys are benefiting from a much more insulated household , having installed external wall insulation to the back of their mid-terrace home . Most of you may think that mid-terrace properties are ok - in terms of keeping the heat as they only have two exposed walls - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see the back of the house has in fact 3 exposed walls and if left uninsulated the heat just escapes and the property is not comfortable to live in . <p> Here , 100mm of Kreisel EPS solid wall insulation was used to insulate the external walls . The insulation boards stuck on with adhesive and are then mechanically fixed to the outside brick , held together by plastic caps . Once the boards are put in place they are then rendered over and finished with the waterproof top-coat . <p> The Elsleys were pleased to have received some help from the Government grant , which was available to a limited number of applicants in 2014 , with the rest of the project being self-funded . <p> According to the EPC report that was conducted before the installation date , the Elsleys should save in the region of -200--250 on their annual heating bills and as well as that should have a much cosier and warmer home . <h> External Solid Wall Insulation- St Albans , Hertfordshire <p> St. Albans is a small a picturesque town on the edge- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would have noticed that the buildings are predominantly made out of solid brick walls . <p> This latest install happened right on the edge of town , which features many 1920s and 1930s solid brick properties .

The Kreisel system is held together by mechanical fixings and reinforced but supplementary adhesive . The insulation is then prepared and finished over with a waterproof silicon silicut render . <p> The property had many openings for windows and doors and the key with external solid wall insulation is that as the walls are thickened with the boards , the window sills are extended and finished off so that no water penetrates the house .

Not only has it improved the energy rating , the external wall solution will on average save Mr Smiths family- nearly -400- on heating bills . With the property being cosier and warmer it is also now protected from weathering , as the silicon silicut render goes on top of the insulation to provide all these additional benefits . <p> The photos below show some of- the stages of the installation installation process : <p> Applying Kreisel EPS insulation boards . <p> External solid wall insulation at the back of the property , Greenford- London . <h> External Wall Insulation East London <p> The house in Greenwich was insulated with 10cm thick EPS insulation boards and then rendered with a silicate render .

@@36749008 @5749008/ <h> What is Economy 7 ? <h> August 19 , 2013 <h> What is the Economy 7 tariff ? <p> Economy 7 is simply a 2-tiered tariff that charges you less for using energy at off peak times . Usually this means that energy is cheaper from around midnight to 7am , although this may vary with daylight savings and your region . To compensate , the peak rates are often higher . <p> The reason for this is fairly simple " energy is created by power plants all day , every day . Electricity demand changes throughout the course of each 24-hour period . Unfortunately however , in the case of nuclear and coal power plants , they ca n't simply be switched off at short notice to react to these changes in demand " in the case of nuclear plants in particular , they can take days to power down ' <p> Therefore , even though there is little demand for electricity in the middle of the night , there is an abundance of electricity still being produced , which ca n't be stored and the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As a result Economy 7 was introduced in the 1970 's . This two-tiered electricity tariff provided homes with cheap electricity during the night if they could find a use for it . This saw the advent of two technologies in particular " the storage heater and the off peak water immersion heater , both taking advantage of the cheaper electricity to provide heat / hot water in the home . <h> Does Economy 7 still have a future ? <p> We do a number of substantial number of Green Deal Assessments across London now , and on the whole , coming across storage heaters is pretty rare . Having said that , we do come across them , and they are also part of the Green Deal scheme ( provided you are replacing the old style storage heaters with new ones ) . So is Economy 7 still relevant for the average Joe who has a gas central heating system ? <p> Maybe ! " As a rule of thumb , you need to be using more than 40% of your energy at night to make it worthwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , this could require some considerable changes in how you use your energy . The advent of programmable appliances though will obviously play a big part in this . These are being introduced now prior to the roll out of the smart grid , allowing you to set appliances to run whenever you wish . Obviously if you can get these going at night , then you are quickly going to hit the 40% sweet spot . <p> We quite often mention in our assessments that if you decide to install solar PV you should try using as much of the electricity you create in your own home as possible . A good way to do this if you are out during the day is to install new storage heaters to supplement your central gas heating system . These can then use the electricity you produce during the day and then release the heat over the course of an evening meaning that you do n't need to turn on the gas central heating system . If this is the case , obviously you already have the storage heaters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an economy 7 tariff . <p> In addition , if you are using a heat pump to fulfil your heating requirements , then it also makes sense to be on an economy 7 tariff since the heat pump will continue to operate during the night . <p> If you do want to move onto economy 7 , you must bear in mind that you will have to have a new meter installed , as standard meters are unable to track 2 rates . This usually incurs a charge . <p> The best way of seeing whether economy 7 would save you money is to check on a price comparison site like Uswitch . The site let 's you put in your current usage and compare it to other tariffs . Of course , it will depend on how much you use your energy at night and a change in your energy habits may be required to make it worthwhile . <h> Am I already on Economy 7 ? <p> Your bill will have a day and night rate on it if you are on this tariff . Also , the Meter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also start with 02 if you have Economy 7 . If not , it will have 01 ' and you will be charged the same whatever time of day . <h> What is the difference between Economy 7 , 9 and 10 ? <p> Economy 10 tariffs are not as commonplace and only some providers offer it , but they simply mean that the off-peak period where you get cheaper electricity is 10 hours and not 7 . The times of these off peak hours is also different , with most providers splitting these ten hours between afternoon , evening and night . Usually this means the off peak rate is n't quite as good as economy 7 and there is usually a higher standing charge . Economy 9 is a similar tariff offered by some providers . 184565 @qwx384565 <p> I did n't  know what economy 7 was like most people . After my assessment it really opened my eyes to other money saving tariffs available . I work a lot of night shifts so having cheap energy after seven does n't  benefit me as much as my new tariff , which is more suitable .

We recommend that any damp issues be dealt with before insulation is installed . All internal insulation should be installed with a vapour membrane . <h> Insulating directly to the wall <p> Fixing the insulation directly to the wall is ideal if floorspace is at a premium , but must only be done where there are no damp issues whatsoever , and the existing plaster is smooth and even . This approach is the most straightforward , as the plasterboard with insulation is attached to the wall using screws or adhesive .

It also uses up the most internal floor space compared with the other options . This is because it leaves a gap of around 30mm between the outer wall and a stud wall , to which the insulation is attached .

@@36749012 @5749012/ <h> Are electric radiators cheap to run ? <h> April 11 , 2017 <p> Electric radiators are often the go-to alternative when a gas central heating system is n't an option , but their running costs in comparison to other forms of heating are often a mystery to people . The question is : are electric radiators- cheap to run ? <h> What are electric radiators ? <p> Like- radiators as part of a gas central heating system , electric radiators work through convection . They- are filled with a thermodynamic fluid which warms up when electricity passes through it . When the fluid expands , it gives off heat through the surface of the radiator . This emits- heat into the air around it . The fluid in these convector heaters is usually an oil . <p> In terms of thermal comfort , electric radiators are as effective as gas central- heating , - but they are not cheap to run . It is estimated that running costs are up to three and a half times more expensive than heating with an efficient gas boiler and standard radiators . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radiators often boast that- electricity is 100% efficient . This is true in that all the electrical energy that passes through them is converted to heat energy . However , their overall efficiency is low , just because you get less for your money . <p> It basically all comes down to the fact that a unit of electricity costs far more than a unit of gas . Rates vary depending on your tariff and supplier , but electricity normally costs- around 12p/kWh . In comparison , gas costs around 4p/kWh . <p> Weve written before about the costs of electric heating . For detailed calculations , - see here . <h> Are there any benefits of electric radiators ? <p> Unlike- radiators powered by gas , electric models normally require no maintenance. - Because standard radiators- work by circulating hot water , if the supply is restricted , they do n't  work properly . This means they need bleeding or balancing from time to time . <p> Electric radiators have no moving parts , and there is very little that can go wrong as long as the electricity supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost , you should also factor in maintenance and replacement cost . Electric heaters need to be changed very infrequently , and when they do , that cost is much lower than a new boiler. - Boilers need replacing every 12 years or so , and will cost -2,000 to do so . Every persons requirements will- vary , but you ca n't discount the fact that electric heating has a lower startup cost and maintenance cost whilst having higher running costs . For smaller properties with less to heat , electric can work out as the best option . <h> Should I get electric radiators ? <p> Its pretty hard to- recommend electric heating as anything other than a last resort for the vast majority of customers . It may be that you do n't  have the option of central heating because your property may be off the gas grid . In this case though , you still have options : <p> You could look at installing far infrared heating panels , for example. - They work through ( safe ) radiation , rather than conventional space heating , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . This could save you money on heating for two reasons : <p> You may need to spend less on heating because radiant heat is n't lost through draughts , unlike convection heating , which warms air . <p> You might also need to keep them on for less time , because they continue to warm your house- even once you have turned the- panels off . With convection heating , once the heat has gone , its gone . Radiant heating , on the other hand , warms your walls , floors and furniture , so it will effectively turn your house into a radiator , continuing to throw out heat even after you 've switched the heating off . <p> Infrared has the benefit of being lower on running cost , but also much cheaper to install and maintain than gas boilers . So it really makes sense for many customers as an alternative to electric convector heaters . <p> If you need more information about electric heating , or help with finding an alternative , just get in touch . 
@@36749014 @5749014/ <h> How to Maximise your Domestic RHI Payments <h> March 24 , 2014 <p> In the blog below we highlight two ways you can take maximum advantage of the Domestic RHI that is due to launch in the Spring . <h> Maximising the RHI payments from Heat Pumps <p> So if you are reading this , you are probably aware that the Renewable Heat Incentive is launching imminently . Now , for heat pumps , the key to them working efficiently is that they operate in really well insulated homes , since they produce water at far lower temperatures than traditional central heating temperatures . <p> When they are trying to assess the RHI payment you will be eligible for , they will take the heat demand number right at the bottom of the EPC ( found at the bottom of page 4 as in the picture below ) . The higher the number , the more money you will be paid via the RHI and remember it is the combination of the space heating and water heating that will be used . <p> This essentially means that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , the older your property ( on the whole ) will result on higher RHI payments when you install either a ground source or air source heat pump . <p> Now one of the pre-requisites to getting the RHI , is that if either loft insulation and cavity wall insulation come up as a recommendation on the EPC , these need to get done before you become eligible . However , aside from that , you actually want your house to have a high heat loss so the number at the bottom of the EPC is higher " so if you are thinking of changing you windows or installing solid wall insulation at the same time , you should get the heat pump installed and commissioned before you install these other measures . <p> Obviously this contradicts what I said about heat pumps operating in really well insulated homes , but truth be told , lock in the high payments , get the heat pump installed and then make the house more efficient . <p> If your EPC mentions cavity or loft you will need to get them done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else done until after the heat pump has been installed and you are receiving the RHI . It is the same principle for both ground source and air source heat pumps . <p> Biomass RHI payments are based on the same premise of heat demand as the basis for the payment , so again the more difficult it is to heat , the more money you will receive through the renewable heat incentive . <h> Maximising RHI from Solar Thermal <p> The RHI calculation from solar thermal is more complicated than for any of the other technologies included in the RHI scheme . The main reason is that the MCS approved solar thermal installer will deem the RHI payment for the system , however there is one absolutely key thing to bear in mind . <p> The solar thermal calculation takes occupancy into account the more people residing in the home , the larger the RHI payment . <p> This is a question you will be asked by you MCS installer " you might think it a strange question at the time , but the higher the number you tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to a maximum of 6 occupants ) . So whilst would we never condone lying , if you have the kids staying over or your granny in the annex , do n't be shy to tell the installer . <p> None of the other technologies included within the RHI consider occupancy in the calculation " and it is not taken off the Green Deal report ( you will be asked this during the assessment ) . It is simply a question the MCS installer will ask ! <h> A final tip " metering your RHI payments <p> The Government are offering an additional payment of -230 per year ( for 7 years ) if you are willing to install their specified metering systems . Now in truth these are not cheap , about -1500 for the system to be installed , so the additional payment really is designed to cover that " however there is obviously a purpose to getting them installed ! <p> If you do get a meter installed , and you may be forced to if you keep your normal central heating system , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your heat pump . The key to heat pumps is their SPF " or Seasonal Performance Factor " which dictates their year round efficiency ( Find out more about the SPF here ) . When people talk about heat pumps being 400% efficient " what this really means is that the heat pump has an SPF of 4 , so for every 1 unit of electricity used to run the system , 4 units of useful heat are created . <p> The problem is that manufacturer SPFs can be higher than real life installed units . You want the highest SPF you can , so to ensure this happens metering systems can quickly identify where the heat pump is not working correctly to help you maximise its efficiency " even if the system is not running correctly for a month , you can rack up high electricity bills " the metering system will prevent this . <p> So as a final tip I recommend trying to get this installed " the payments from the Government will cover the install costs , but better still your system will be monitored automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues . 
@@36749015 @5749015/ <h> What are Carbon Dioxide Scrubbers ? <p> In other sections of this- site we have covered the concept of- carbon capture and storage , which is the- process of- removing carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere and storing it . Most of the technologies we have looked at focus on removing the gas where it is developed in high quantities , for example in the exhaust gases produced by coal power stations . <p> Carbon dioxide is found in the air everywhere though ; so why just concentrate on where the gas is emitted in higher quantities ? <p> It is possible to scrub CO2- from the air anywhere ; the technology has been around for decades and used on Submarines and Spacecraft , to name but a couple of examples . So the potential is there to research and build on this technology , scaling it up so it can be positioned to effectively scrub the air in any location . <h> How does CO2- Scrubbing work ? <p> Despite several different designs currently being in development , they all are based on a common chemical reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought into contact with a sorbent material which chemically binds with the Carbon Dioxide . A sorbent material is one that simply absorbs a gas or liquid ( e.g. sponge is sorbent as it absorbs many times its own weight in water ) . <p> The greater the surface area of the sorbent , the more efficiently it will absorb the gas or liquid , therefore different mechanisms have been suggested to maximise exposure of the sorbent to the carbon dioxide , thereby maximising it 's scrubbing ability . <p> The- Palo Alto Research Centre- has proposed to draw the CO2- through a fine mist of liquid sorbent . Housing this technology in towers that are several metres high , the mist would react with the gas and be collected in a chamber where they would once again be separated . The pure CO2- could be compressed into liquid form and removed , while the sorbent would be recycled and used again to collect more of the gas . <p> Klaus Lackner , has created another proposal to maximise the surface area of the sorbent , and this to apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to react with it . Once the initial reaction has taken place , liquid chemicals are washed over the sheets that create a stronger bond with the CO2- than the sorbent . The liquid can then be collected ( as it now is bound to the CO2 ) , and this can be heated which will allow the CO2- to be stripped from the liquid , and so once again the pure CO2- could be compressed into liquid form and removed , while the liquid can be recycled and used again to wash future CO2- from the sheets . <h> Issues facing the technology <p> The air-capture machines are electrically powered , and most electricity produced ( via non-recyclable methods ) has carbon dioxide emissions associated with it . So an important question is whether the carbon dioxide stripped from the air is in excess of the carbon dioxide produced ' to drive the machine . In fact , Klaus Lackner 's prototype uses 100kwh of electricity to remove 1 tonne of CO2- from the air , and this power required equates to 35kg of CO2- being produced as emissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount produced . In fact , if the energy used to drive it is derived from renewable energy forms then the figures become even more attractive . <p> Another issue facing the technology is that the sorbent material can not be recycled for ever , and has a finite lifecycle , after which it has to be replaced so this makes sorbent supply high ( and expensive ) , in addition there will be maintenance costs associated with swapping the sorbent material over . The cost currently associated with removing 1 tonne of CO2- from the atmosphere is about -150 per tonne when using these carbon scrubber methods , while the cost of trading a tonne of carbon is about -6--13 ( see- carbon trading ) . Only when the cost of removing a tonne is lower than the trading cost will this become truly commercially viable . Dr Lackner has suggested that he feels that with technical improvements and economies of scale achievable if the products become commercially successful , then the cost will come down to approximately -30 per tonne . In addition trading carbon prices will rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green promises endeavour to make the cost of emitting CO2- unattractive . <p> Finally , where do we position the carbon scrubbers ? In the grand scheme of things , CO2- present in the atmosphere is found in very low percentages , roughly 0.04% ( with 99% made up of Nitrogen and oxygen ) , so actually removing it out of the atmosphere is difficult . Therefore when we produce the compressed gas as a result of the carbon scrubbing technologies , it is important that we have a use for it . CO2- is a useful gas in it 's own right " it can be used to pump into commercial greenhouses to increase plant growth , it can be used to inject into natural gas reserve beds to drive more of the gas out ; It can even be transformed into fuel for transport . So we should erect the carbon scrubbers where the CO2- produced can be then used to perform a useful function . In the future , if the technology takes hold and is profitable ( the stored gas can be sold for more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the widespread launch of carbon scrubber orchids ' , simply acting to remove the gas from the atmosphere , but until that time it is important that we spend time considering the best places and set ups for these technologies . <p> we have some sort of reaction in our manufacturing facility , which resulted to release of carbon dioxide with 2bar pressure for about 10minutes , we need a scrubber to absorb this carbon rather of letting go direct in environment , please let us know the system if you can help out .

Thanks for any help . <p> Hi Marie , absolutely this is no problem at all the colour can be matched to any colour wall to be honest .

The pressurised may ( and should ! ) give better water pressure than a combi although this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both operate at mains pressure , but a unvented system stores hot water and this is sent around the house at mains water pressure . A combi boiler is fed water at mains pressure , but normally cant create the hot water at a sufficient rate to keep the pressure this high . You are looking at about -1000+ for the Megaflo , although you might want to look at a cheaper Joule pressurised cylinder ( I have this at home and it works great ) . You will also need to get a new boiler you wont be able to recycle the combi boiler . I suggest looking at Vaillant , Worcester Bosch or Baxi as boiler manufacturers . Here you are looking at anything from about -900 . Then it depends on location of the current boiler and where you want to move it to , as well as the existing pipe work , the incoming gas supply and so forth .

The number of people having- to choose whether to heat or eat is- widely believed to be one of the reasons for a huge rise in food bank use in the past few years . <h> What is the energy price cap ? <p> The promised cap is not really as radical as it sounds . Although , it would prevent energy companies raising prices , the regulator ( Ofgem ) would hold the power to change them every 6 months in line with changing costs for energy suppliers . We hear a lot from energy companies about unforeseen hikes in prices for imported gas etc. , and at this point it is unclear whether Ofgem would be just as keen to raise- consumer bills to cover these . <h> What would- the energy price cap mean for energy companies ? <p> It could mean a significant reduction in profits for energy companies or it might just mean profits wont continue to rise year on year . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cheap fixed rate tariffs , as energy companies will look for ways to boost profits . <p> Another possible change would be a reduction in choice for consumers . At the moment , independent/small energy companies rely on people getting fed up of price hikes from the big companies , and swapping to them . If these hikes no longer happen in future , people wo n't swap so the small companies wont have a customer base ! This means no competition for the big six if smaller energy companies close , giving them more power than ever . In addition , all the green alternative providers are currently still quite small , and if their profits are threatened there might be less choice for those looking to get their energy from renewable sources . <h> What else could be done about rising energy bills ? <p> There are two obvious- ways that any future government could improve things for customers : <p> The oft-mentioned ( and pretty vague ) costs cited- as a reason- for energy companies- ( and now Ofgem ) to- raise prices i.e. primarily the buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem if the UK generated more of its energy itself . If more was invested in solar , wind and tidal power plants , the UK could be much more self-reliant , and energy could in theory be cheaper as a result. - Successive governments have failed to create viable energy policies , and as a result there 's still the potential for us to be heavily affected by- the unavailability of energy from external sources just like we were in the 1970s oil crisis . <p> Business Secretary Greg Clark revealed this week that he has never looked at switching his tariff or energy supplier , because its a hassle . Its the spreading of this misinformation that discourages people from looking for a better deal . It normally- takes minutes to switch provider via online price comparison sites your new supplier does all the work for you . Its tempting to suggest that if the- government really wanted to control the profits of big energy companies and help people save money , theyd raise awareness of the advantages of switching deals . <h> Would this price cap really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win the election , and implement the changes , it is difficult to predict what impact it would have . Its possible that a cap would introduce some more stability , but unclear to what extent , and would other impacts it might have .

@@36749026 @5749026/ <h> Can I replace my back boiler ? <h> January 8 , 2016 <p> UPDATE : Please note that since this blog was written , the last model of back boiler has been taken out of production . You may be able to find a back boiler at a plumbing merchants but this will be discontinued stock . We would recommend switching to a conventional or combi boiler instead . <p> Over the years there have been many different types of boiler installed in people 's homes . We come across a number of different styles and models when we visit people 's homes , and perhaps the most discussed is the infamous back boiler ' . <h> What is a back boiler ? <p> A back boiler is a unit fitted to the rear of a fireplace that both heats the room it is in , but also provides hot water for central heating and household use . They were installed frequently in the 1970s and 80s , and although there are modern condensing back boilers , they are very rarely installed these days . <p> You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your gas fire . If you take off the plate at the bottom of the heater , there will be a model number under there that you can check , and you should be able to see the pilot light as well . <h> What are the advantages of a back boiler ? <p> So why were they installed so much 40 odd years ago ? The back boiler will improve the efficiency of the stove , or heater in front of it by acting as a heat sink . They also take up less space than a traditional floor standing boiler , because they are hidden behind a fireplace that would otherwise be empty space . The direct competition back in the 70s would have been the giant washing machine like boilers that sit on the ground , look a little ugly and take up acres of space in your house . It is easy to see why they were attractive back then . <p> Add on top of that the fact that back boilers are extremely reliable " they tend to break down less than conventional boilers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Why did back boilers get phased out ? <p> There are probably several reasons that have lead to the decline of the back boiler . Firstly , those fridge sized floor standing boilers from the 70s are long gone , and the units themselves are much smaller , more compact and attractive . The combi boiler has meant that all the tanks that used to be necessary for a boiler are no longer needed and a small wall mounted unit takes up less space than both a conventional or back boiler , making them the preferred choice for smaller properties . <p> The other point is that since 2005 , regulations mean that you need to install high efficiency condensing boilers . Since at the time there were no condensing back boilers , anyone who had their back boiler break down for good or just wanted to upgrade , had to install a conventional wall mounted boiler instead . <h> What are the options for back boilers today ? <p> Of course , there are many properties where moving over to a conventional boiler is going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and gas lines adding significantly to the cost . <p> There is now however , at least 1 model of back boiler on the market that meets the current efficiency standards , so you can install a modern back boiler no problem these days . <h> Should you upgrade your back boiler ? <p> Although the cost of upgrading to a new back boiler is going to be a couple of thousand pounds , the savings over an old G-rated boiler are going to be considerable . Depending on the size of the house and your gas consumption , you are probably looking at savings of -200-300 a year . That means the new boiler will pay back in less than 10 years . <h> Installing a new boiler <p> Are you thinking local installer map . <p> &gt;&gt;&gt; GO TO OUR LOCAL INSTALLER MAP NOW &lt;&lt;&lt; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a local installer to install a new boiler in your home , just fill in the form below and we will be in touch shortly ! <p> Need a new boiler ? 184572 @qwx384572 <p> I have moved into a property that has a back boiler which i am not familiar with . It is a Baxi Bermuda GF3 super . the heating system seems ok but i am not a fan of the existing fire . Can the gas fire be replaced and also what fire options are there that are compatible with my boiler ? <p> Hi I have recently had a combi boiler put in my council house to replace my back boiler but they did n't  remove the back boil from my lounge I have an electric fire in the hole but I 'm looking to cover the hole with out having to remove the back boiler I assume that is have Been disconnected from the gas ? ? Will this be safe to do <p> Hi Kylie , thanks for getting in touch . There should n't be any gas running to the old boiler , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to confirm and let you know whether it is safe to cover the hole . <p> Sorry James , but you 're talking nonsense . I 've tried to get the new Baxi Bermuda HE back boiler for 2 years and its impossible . Coupled with the fact that only 1 chimney liner is compatible with this system . And its harder to find than Lord Lucan . <p> I 'm surprised you 're making such a claim . Because it simply is n't true . <p> I agree with you Ian , I am known as gadget man by my friends , but the 2 properties we own still have 1980s inefficient Baxi boilers ( one a back boiler ) . They might be costing us -200-300 year extra each in gas , but to me this is a small price to pay for convenience and low cost reliability . They get serviced annuallyish for about -70 including a new -5 thermocouple . <p> The odd times they have broken down its 90% been the thermocouple and once a new gas valve -80 . Always parts been available and fixed on same day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time span , she is now on her 4th boiler and has had numerous expensive breakdowns , of fans , circuit boards and none have been same day repairs as parts have to be ordered and not available off the shelf . <p> As we all know boilers are not known for being thoughtful and only breaking down on warm sunny days ! Far from it . <p> I have no idea what she has paid over the years for the new boilers to be installed along with the hassle of actually arranging and getting the job done . <p> Our house is well insulated and we have modern zoned heating controls , so have best efficiency there . <p> We are going to keep our old boilers for as long as possible , because they are so simple and generally reliable and when they do have a wobble , its usually a -5 part and fixed on the same day , the day its probably below freezing outside ! <p> Those ugly floor standing boilers are NOT long gone . I have an ideal E type 80,000 BTU which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple in 20 years . The energy consumed by making new boilers every 12 years plus the travel of the fitters plus the repairs needed every three years of a new boiler is hardly conducive to saving the world . <p> Hi Ian , you may well be right it depends on how much gas you are using to be honest . You boiler is currently less than 60% efficient , and a new one would be nearer 90% so you are looking at 50% saving in terms of the volume of gas used . If you are using a lot of gas then it would make sense to make the change . 
@@36749027 @5749027/ <h> Significant changes to the RHI scheme April 2016 <h> March 31 , 2016 <p> While the government took the decision to cut FIT payments drastically as a means of cost saving , when it comes to the Renewable Heat Incentive , it appears they are very keen to expand it . DECC announced earlier this month that they are looking to increase funding from -430 million in 2015/16 to -1.15 billion in 2020/21 , an increase of over two and a half times . <p> As keen as this increased spending seems , the government are looking to get more bang for their buck . Therefore , they are proposing various changes to the RHI that we discuss in a bit more detail below . If you want to read all 89 pages of the government 's report , you can download it by clicking here . <p> The- DECC wants to make this RHI scheme more accessible for families that are less able to pay . Renewable heating technologies are expensive to install and as such , these technologies are out of reach to many households . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make these- technologies more accessible . <h> Long live the RHI but changes are imminent ! <p> The proposed changes are taking place in two stages " the first will be introduced in just a couple of days " on 1st April 2016 . The second set of stages will be implemented sometime in 2017 . <p> Under the RHI , spending is controlled by degression . Degression operates by applying an automatic tariff reduction once the budget ( for a technology and/or the whole scheme ) has reached pre-determined trigger points . This mechanism is not changing , however the digression assessments and potential reductions in tariffs have been announced right up until 2017 . <p> There is a proposal to bring in a budget mechanism , which serves as a backstop to the degression mechanism , whereby the RHI scheme would close to new entrants if a certain level of spend was reached in a particular quarter . This was introduced for the Feed-in Tariff so it makes sense that the government would be keen to roll this out for the RHI scheme too , to protect itself- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen to change the way the RHI is linked to inflation . Previously the scheme has been been linked to RPI , however from 1st April 2016 the RHI will now be linked to the Consumer Prices Index ( CPI ) . This will only be for new entrants " existing participants in the scheme who have signed up prior to 1st April 2016 will still be paid the RHI linked to RPI . <p> Under the existing legislation , renewable heating systems installed in second homes under the Domestic RHI have to be metered . This is to ensure value for money for the taxpayer , as the deeming methodology used to calculate payments for the majority of properties would result in overpaying homes that are not occupied all the time . Ofgem determines whether a property is a second home by asking whether it was occupied for at least 183 days in the 12 months before application . However , previously this has unintentionally captured self-builders who have only recently moved into their homes . This means they are either required to install a meter at additional cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RHI " in the new proposed changes to the scheme , the application process for self-builders has been changed to prevent this issue from occurring . <h> Heat demand for different renewable techs will now be limited <p> Under current RHI legislation , there is no limit to the heat demand that is eligible for the RHI payments . This means that for bigger properties , the RHI payments could be far higher than the cost of installing the renewable heating technology . This is particularly true with biomass boilers , with some households making over -10,000 per year from their renewable heating system , resulting in a payback of just 2-3 years . Under the proposed changes , DECC are recommending that heat demand limits are introduced " and the limits would be as follows : <p> By putting these limits in place , the financial return from the RHI is- capped . This means that regardless of the size of your property , once- you reach the limit , your quarterly RHI payments will be capped . Bigger properties tend to have higher heat demands , but insulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> To help encourage the take-up of renewable heating technologies for those lacking the initial capital to cover the install costs , the government is proposing allowing householders to assign their right to RHI payments to a company that has financed their renewable heating technology . Householders would still own the system . The government is also proposing third party ownership as a possibility , where a company that has financed the renewable heating system would be able to apply for the RHI payments . Both of these mechanisms would help open up these technologies for those lacking the initial capital . <h> The end for solar thermal ? RHI support withdrawn from 2017 <p> Perhaps the biggest reform the government is looking to implement- is removing RHI support for solar thermal . This would start in- 2017 , but would effectively kill demand for this technology . This seems an interesting decision considering that the government is looking to increase RHI budgets over the next 5-6 years . <p> If you have any thoughts on the RHI , or have any questions , please comment below and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <h> 8 comments <p> Can not understand government thinking . They are happy to subsidise nuclear heavily through the back door with all associated costs and safety issues which all ultimately fall back to the taxpayer but for far less money seem to keep making true , green , renewable energy far less attractive . Complete madness to me when renewable energy costs are falling and nuclear increasing . Heavy Taxation on rooftop solar ( restrospectively ) for those who are n't  exporting seems unfair and a slap in the face for those who were trying to do the right and were encouraged by the government to do this <p> Not only do we have 16 Solar Panels which provide electricity and hot water we also have air source heat pumps . We receive FIT payments but on the lower rate . Recently put our home on the market and honestly thought the very low bills coupled with the FIT payments would encourage offers . Not a bit of it so far the people who have viewed do not show any interest at all and when the savings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mains gas nor oil at our new property At BT61 7EF- only electric with an economy &amp; system that simply does not work ! We want to evaluate a heat pump from with ground or air -but finding the expertise to give us a quote seems impossible to find . We also want to put in double glazing but the local planning regs for a listed building specifically forbid this ! <p> Hi Ivan , have you considered secondary glazing ? Many companies out there that offer fantastic solutions to meet the requirements of a listed building . However , with regards to heat-pumps this only becomes viable if you can bring the u-value down sufficiently of your applications ( walls , roof and windows ) . If you can not insulate due to planning restrictions there may seem very little point in a heat-pump . A quality biomass boiler may be the only feasible option . <p> Hi Tim , I genuinely do n't  think there is anything strange going on here . The Government are keen to be seen to be helping those in energy poverty , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer the initial funding and then take the RHi payments . I think this is why they are increasing the funding because the scheme will be used by more and more people . <p> Hi Graham not that we have heard . I think it is mainly the more mainstream techs where people are beginning to take advantage ( i.e. invest 200k and get -1m plus back over the 7 years ! ) we are hearing more and more cases of this .

After more than one beer , he suggested that I could n't halve my energy bills this winter compared to last year . The prize " a summer of free kebabs from our local restaurant ! That is quite a challenge , and anyone in their right mind would have turned him down , but perhaps it was the beer talking " I was going to give it a go . <p> Six months is a long period of time to cut the bill by that much . It was going to be a real challenge . My property is a smallish mid terrace 1950s property in the London suburbs . <h> Warm vs cold winters <p> The first thing I realised having sobered up a little was that the amount of energy we use is actually really dependent on just how warm or cold the winter is . If I was unlucky with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating up and lose the bet . Writing this in April , I can reflect and say that the weather was actually pretty mild , and ( luckily ) that meant there was a lot less pressure to have the heating on . <h> What could I do to get my bills down ? <p> Having so far only been through one winter in my home , - I actually had n't done some of the more simple things that can improve the thermal performance of a property . It only had a 50mm covering of insulation in the loft , and the cavities were not insulated , so I got on to one of our partner companies and had them sort our insulation out pronto . I felt a little warmer already ! <p> We also were having new doors and a couple of the windows replaced as well , so that was going to make a bit of a difference . But these things on their own were unlikely to halve the bill . After all , much of my energy usage was actually spent cooking and running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with James to let me do the bet based only on the gas bill , as this is the way I heat my home , but being the cold-hearted man he is , he denied my embittered pleas . <p> How was I going to get that electric bill down ? Well , we were fortunate enough to have bought some- new A+ rated appliances shortly after moving in , so that would be of some help . But I would still have to be vigilant with some of our more highly-powered gadgets . Its lucky I do n't drink tea or coffee , as kettles- can be a big energy sapper . <h> January " The half way mark <p> In January , I took a meter reading and checked it against last year . Last year I managed to use -523 of gas and -245 of electricity from October to March . Things were n't looking that good . I had used around 65% of my limit already , with still 3 months to go .

The waistline may have suffered a little here " I know you can get some very nutritious microwavable food but I think the cold got to me a little ! <p> The thermostat by this stage was set to 17 , and I wrapped up with lots of thermals and jumpers when sitting in the house .

@@36749030 @5749030/ <h> Wave Hub , Cornwall <h> What is Wave Hub ? <p> Wave Hub is a grid-connected offshore facility for the large scale testing of wave energy- technologies . It is located in south-west England , 16km off the north shore of Cornwall ( see Figure 1 ) . The Wave Hub concept was conceived in 2003 by the South West Regional Development Agency ( SWRDA ) , the necessary consents for the project were obtained in 2007 and Wave Hub was set up in 2010 . <h> Wave Hub How It Works <p> The Wave Hub project holds a 25-year lease of 8km2 of seabed that is split into four separate 1km x 2km berths which the project will underlease to wave energy device developers for an agreed term . The length of tenure for developers is not fixed , Wave Hub expects developers to test the reliability of their machines over a number of years and then build larger , commercial scale projects in the region and elsewhere . <p> The Wave Hub unit itself is connected to the shore via twin 300mm2 33kV power triads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seabed ( See Figure 2 ) . This cable is terminated within the hub unit that lies on the seabed onto two bus bars , and each bus bar services two berthing areas . Each bus bar has two 300m tails ' composed of a three core 120mm2 33 kV cable that operates at 11kV . There is therefore one tail ' for each berth . The lead device from each wave energy array will connect to the hub via an 11kV dry-mate connector situated at the end of each Wave Hub tail and provide both electrical and fibre optic connection , allowing remote control and monitoring of the wave energy devices as well as electrical transmission . <p> The cable running from the Wave Hub to the shore connects to a new electricity substation at nearby Hayle that consists of an 11kV/33kV transformer with associated switchgear and power factor correction equipment to ensure within specification delivery to the grid . Initial operation of the Wave Hub system will be at 11kV with capability for 16-20MW of power . Once subsea components that allow 33kV operation are developed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 50MW devices . <p> The seabed in the region of Wave Hub 's lease is generally 50m to 60m below sea level , and with the south west peninsula exposed to an excellent wave resource in the form of the prevailing westerly Atlantic swell , the typical range in the Wave Hub location is 15-25 kW/m ( kilowatts per metre of wave face ) . Furthermore the region 's strong 400kV grid that runs close to both the north and south coast of the peninsular , and numerous shallow and deep water ports reduces potentially high costs of necessary infrastructure . <h> Building Expertise and Research Around the Wave Hub <p> The nearby Universities of Plymouth and Exeter have joined forces to create the Peninsula Research Institute for Marine Renewable Energy , and with the region 's history of advanced maritime and engineering , Wave Hub is in the vicinity of a skilled workforce complemented by world-class research and facilities that enable the project to fulfil its target of bridging the current gap in the industry between R &amp;D , initial prototypes and full commercialisation . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own renewable energy agency that has developed the Offshore Supply Chain aimed at supporting a network of companies active in the offshore energy sector numbering in the hundreds . <h> Wave Hub Environmental Impact <p> In terms of the environmental impacts , Wave Hub will oversee a co-ordinated and ongoing programme of environmental monitoring with its customers , and extensive baseline data has been recorded to facilitate accurate determination of any environmental impacts of different devices . <h> Wave Hub and Developing Wave Energy in the UK <p> The UK has the largest wave energy resource in Europe , and the feasible resource is approximately 50TWh/year , with a practical potential for up to 1,000MW of installed capacity by 2020 as suggested by several reviews . In the South West specifically , a report predicted the installed capacity could be from 83-285 MW by 2020 , with the top estimate being equivalent to -57 million in revenue .

@@36749031 @5749031/ <h> Introduction to Solar Thermal <h> Renewables <h> What is solar thermal ? <p> Solar thermal- ( also known as solar heating ) harnesses the energy provided by the sun to provide thermal energy to heat water . The hot water produced by the solar heating can be used to supplement your domestic hot water ( although the temperature might need to be topped up by a boiler ) , larger stores of water ( like swimming pools ) , underfloor heating , and for space heating/cooling . <p> Unlike a- solar photovoltaic cell- array , which is designed to produce electricity , a solar heating system is designed simply to produce heat . A well-designed solar heating system will provide approximately 55% of your annual domestic hot water requirement . However , as it is reliant on the sun , your solar heating system will produce more heat in the summer months . <h> Types of solar thermal system <p> Solar heating systems all have a few components in common : a solar collector , insulated heat transport piping and heat storage . More complex systems also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climates ) . There are three main types of solar collectors : <p> 1 . Flat panel solar collectors <p> These are the most common type of solar heating technology and consist of a box with a piece of glass on the top and a dark absorber plate on the bottom . Sunlight passes through the glazing on the top of the box , heating up the absorber plate and converting the solar energy into thermal energy . Copper pipes are attached on the top of the absorber plates , and the liquid flowing through these pipes absorbs the heat , which is then pumped away and stored until it is needed in the house . <p> 2 . Evacuated tube solar collectors <p> The evacuated tube systems tend to be more efficient , especially in cold or cloudy climates ; however their advanced design makes them more expensive . These solar collectors consist of rows of parallel , transparent glass tubes . Each tube contains an absorber assembly and the entire tube is evacuated of any air ( so it operates within a vacuum ) . The sunlight enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is absorbed . As this is operating within a vacuum , heat does not travel back from the absorber- to the glass , so these are more efficient . A fluid transfers the heat from the absorber assembly through to the storage tank , where it can be used . <p> The two major advantages of evacuated tube collectors are that they can produce warmer water ( so you will not need to supplement the temperature with a boiler ) and they can also produce more hot water than flat-panelled solar collectors . <p> 3 . Plastic collectors <p> These are the cheapest type of solar collector and consist of black plastic pipe treated to withstand UV degradation . Hot water is simply pumped through the black plastic pipes , where it warms up ( as the plastic absorbs the suns energy ) .

Likewise , the amount of heat you can produce is directly proportional to the amount of installed surface area you have ; therefore if you only have a small roof , then this technology may not be appropriate . <p> In addition , you will produce more hot water in the summer , as the energy from the sun is more intense at this time , therefore you may well have to supplement the temperature of the water in the winter using a boiler . To boost the system , your boiler must be compatible with your solar heating system , but currently most combi or- CHP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very important that you check with your installer before undergoing any works . <p> If you live in much colder climates you may need to have some sort of antifreeze within your system- ( when water freezes it turns to ice it expands , - potentially causing cracks in the pipes ) . <p> If you live in a listed building please note the restrictions . Like with many green technologies , it is worth contacting the local planning office to get permission to place the panels , to save yourself problems further down the line . <h> Installing solar thermal normally requires a new hot water tank <p> For many of us with old heat-only boilers , we have a hot water tank hidden away in the airing cupboard . Typically these hot water tanks are heated by a boiler and were purpose-built . <p> Since the introduction of the RHI , there has been a huge increase in the number of people installing solar thermal in their homes . <p> If you decide to install solar thermal in your home you will need a hot water tank to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem though , is that you ca n't plumb one of these systems into the older hot water tanks that are historically found with boilers . <h> Twin coiler cylinders <p> The reason for this is that inside the hot water tank there needs to be a separate coil for each hot water source ' . In this case you would need a coil for the solar thermal and one- for the hot water . Normally in a residential solar store ( i.e. a hot water tank with a solar coil ) , the solar is connected to the lower coil and the boiler ( or main heating source ) is connected to the top coil . <p> Solar coils are much larger than traditional boiler coils because they need a far bigger surface area to transfer their heat into the water compared to a boiler . The reason is that the hot water travelling through the solar thermal coil is at a much lower temperature than the water travelling through a boiler coil . <p> As a guide , the surface area of a solar thermal coil needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be as little as 0.6m2 this increased surface area maximises the opportunity for heat transfer and is a must based on the lower water temperature flowing through the coil . <p> If you cast your mind back to your GCSE science , you will know that heat rises and therefore within a hot water tank , the water at the top of the tank is far warmer than the bottom of the tank . <p> In a solar thermal store , it is important that this temperature differential is maximised and this is achieved by making the hot water tank rather large and tall . So while the top of the tank could achieve temperatures of 600C plus , the water at the bottom of the tank might be as low as 150C degrees . What this means is that even if the solar thermal is only producing water to 200C degrees , it will still contribute to the hot water demand of the property . <h> Storing the hot water you produce on sunny days <p> Since the hot water tanks used for solar thermal systems tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more hot water than is actually required by most families that install one of them . Since solar thermal is intermittent , ( i.e. it produces much more hot water when the sun is shining ) , this oversized heat tank allows you to store the hot water ; thereby taking advantage of favourable conditions a day or two later to help minimise the need to use the boiler . <h> Maximising return on your investment <p> The- Renewable Heat Incentive- ( RHI ) is now up and running , which works- in a- similar- way to the- Feed-in Tariff , - rewarding you for any hot water you produce from renewable sources. - You can find all the information you need about the RHI on our page here . <h> Benefits <p> Solar water heating will provide hot water throughout the year , although less so in winter . <p> Once you have installed the equipment , it provides a free source of hot water . 184564 @qwx384564 <p> All- solar technologies are reliant on the sun shining ; hot water will not be produced at night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar heating is significantly lower than that achieved with gas or electricity-based water heaters . <h> Cost <p> The cost of installing a solar hot water system ranges from approximately -1,500 for a DIY system , to -2,000--5,000 for a commercially installed system . These prices however , are dependent on the size of the system . The savings resulting from the installation will be approximately -50 -90 per year . <h> Installing Solar Thermal <p> Interested in installing shortly ! <p> Interested in solar thermal ? 184572 @qwx384572 
@@36749032 @5749032/ <h> Can too much insulation cause overheating ? <h> March 19 , 2014 <p> Last summer the Daily Mail published an article claiming that too much insulation installed under the Green Deal could cause overheating of homes and endanger old people . <p> Since we are now approaching warmer weather ( or what passes for warm weather in the UK ) , I thought it would be right to tackle this accusation and explain just why the opposite is in fact true ! <h> How does insulation work ? <p> During the winter , the air inside the home is warmer than the air outside . The insulation slows down the movement of energy from the warm area to the cold area , creating a thermal barrier that means your boiler does n't have to work as hard to keep the home warm . The thicker the insulation , and the lower the U-value , the better this thermal barrier is and so the slower the heat will escape the home . <p> During a summers day when the temperature may hit 30 degrees , the air outside is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heating off , the house warms up gradually through the day as the walls and roof absorb the heat of the day . But because the air outside is warmer the thermal barrier created by the insulation will again slow the movement of heat , but in the opposite direction . Warm air in the loft will not be able to penetrate into the home as easily , whilst insulation in the walls will prevent them from warming the home as quickly as well . <h> Will insulation make nights too warm ? <p> It is true that if you home is too warm when you go to bed , insulation will slow the release of heat from the property . This is easily negated by ensuring that you keep the home well ventilated , opening windows , for example . Anyone who does n't open their windows in a heatwave is asking for trouble " a bit of common sense is all that is needed ! <p> To be honest there are about half a dozen days a year in the UK where we do find ourselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally about 6 months when we need to have the heating on , so on balance it is clearly better to install the insulation and take action when it is too warm rather than visa versa . <h> Are there any negatives to installing insulation ? <p> Insulation is a safe , important way to make your home more comfortable , and it will help make your heating bills more affordable . There is absolutely no reason why you should not insulate your home , as long as it is done properly and appropriate measures taken with regards to safety . <p> Poorly installed loft insulation that does not consider your wiring and lighting can cause fires , but this is easily avoided by capping the light fittings and taking care not to cover wires . Any installer worth their salt should be able to do this . For cavity wall insulation , vents are sometimes required to prevent damp and provide sufficient ventilation for the property . <h> Is air tightness a problem for air quality ? <p> It is important for your home to have good air quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said this , some properties with extreme air tightness , like passivhaus buildings , have very good air quality . They utilise natural ventilation to improve the air , so whilst it is worth considering your air quality , it should not be a reason to avoid installing insulation . <h> Insulation is vital for your home <p> Wherever you live and whatever the type of property , insulation is absolutely vital . With spiralling energy costs it will become even more so .

Originally , there was no insulation in the roofs when the houses were built in the 1960s . Constant encouragement to insulate roof spaces has meant that deeper and deeper levels of insulation have been fitted in peoples roofs . That 's a good thing , right ? Wrong .

The cost of repairing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My next door neighbour does n't  see this and his roof is awash .

I have 300mm of insulation in my roof , but also extensive eaves ventilation . Someone in Government ought to address this problem because it is costing some old folk very dearly . <p> Hi Kathryn , Old people do like it warm do n't  they ! That 's not the fault of the insulation though , its because they are keeping their heating on longer than necessary , or setting their thermostat too high . Their bills would either be higher without the insulation or they would have to have the house cooler and complain how cold they are all the time !

@@36749036 @5749036/ <h> Should I buy thermodynamic panels ? <h> March 14 , 2017 <p> Thermodynamic panels are a form of renewable heating. - They basically work similarly to air source heat pumps , but are less bulky and do n't  require- fans . <p> The panels work by circulating liquid coolant which absorbs heat from the atmosphere and turns it into gas . The gas then goes through a compressor , which boosts its temperature so that it is hot enough to heat water . In theory they take the best elements of solar thermal and heat pumps and pull them together into one technology . <p> If you know how your fridge works , imagine that in reverse and you 'll get the general idea <h> The theory behind thermodynamic panels <p> The technology hinges on the difference in temperature between the coolant and the air around it .

One issue is that they are pretty complicated , and complicated equipment tends to go wrong more often , and be more difficult to fix .

@@36749038 @5749038/ <h> External Wall Insulation in South Wales <h> November 8 , 2016 <p> If you live in South Wales , external wall insulation could be a great option for you . <p> Most properties in the UK are of masonry construction so your bricks and mortar , but the process of how we go about insulating their external walls varies quite a bit . If a- property in South Wales was constructed before the Second World War , it is very likely to be of solid construction ( so a single skin of brick , 220mm to 250mm thick ) with plastering internally , then actual brick or some render on the outside ( the render came much later ) . Usually properties from the 1950s were built from cavity walls ( 270mm to 310mm thick ) , with an air gap in the middle of two layers of brick or thermal block with brick on the outside . <p> If you have- ever driven through The Valleys , you will have noticed the miles and miles of terraced properties that are part of the view . Those properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mining boom and other associated industries taking off . These properties were mostly built with solid construction . Terraced solid construction is also common in metropolitan areas such as Cardiff , Swansea and Newport , and semi-detached properties built in the 1930s are also common in some of the older sub-urban areas of those towns and cities . <p> Previous government funding schemes that were very generous ( and probably never coming back in their old- forms ) , allowed for a large volume of retrofit insulation projects in South Wales . These took place across Newport , Cardiff and right down past Bridgend , mainly targeting cavity wall properties , since the cost of the measure was much cheaper than retrofitting solid walls . <h> Typical property construction in South Wales <p> However due to the nature of cavity wall insulation- there were problems , either because properties were either not suitable for retrofit insulation ( structural reasons ) , but also due to the high exposure areas in the south-west of the country ( higher winds and more damp weather ) . In addition , an independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties in Wales , of which half had cavity wall insulation failure . A large proportion of these were in the South Wales Valleys . <h> Why does cavity wall insulation fail in Wales ? <p> As mentioned briefly above , South Wales is particularly susceptible to cavity wall insulation failure because of its characteristically wet weather ! <p> Unfortunately , although cavity wall insulation can be effective , it can also be a nightmare if installed incorrectly . The material can form a bridge from the exterior wall to the interior wall , which rainwater travels across and causes damp indoors . It can also slip over time , meaning it is unevenly dispersed in the cavity , and therefore ineffective . <p> Some opportunistic tradesmen- over the years have installed cavity wall insulation in properties where it is just not suitable for instance those which are privy to driving or consistent rainfall . The insulation material is never going to be able to withstand these conditions for long . Also many properties are rendered and some of this render , due to the nature of it has failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties then being pumped with cavity wall insulation , it has made the damp problems worse ! <p> This is why we suggest external solid wall insulation in these cases . In fact , even properties with functioning cavity wall insulation can benefit from the measure . <h> Why get solid wall insulation in South Wales ? <p> There are several reasons why solid wall insulation is a great alternative . Firstly , there is no limit to the thickness of insulation you can install on external walls , unlike in the cavity , which can only be so wide . This means- bigger energy savings and higher levels of thermal comfort. - Walls store warmth and slowly release it back into the home . For example , 90mm of EPS attached to a traditional 9-inch solid brick , will reduce the U-value ( which is a measure of how much energy is lost ) from 2.2 down to just 0.3 per m2K , bringing it very close to the standards of a- newly constructed wall . As a result , you can expect energy savings of up to 40% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gives the exterior walls a waterproof covering. - It also stops penetrating damp . Because it raises the temperature of external walls , the reduced temperature of walls indoors and outdoors is reduced , thus lowering the risk of condensation and damp in your home . <p> Here are some typical properties we have picked in South Wales with solid brick construction , and as you can see pretty old render as well .

@@36749039 @5749039/ <h> Can insulation improve the value of your property ? <h> June 22 , 2015 <p> We have already discussed the value of increasing your homes EPC rating , and we can be sure that more energy efficient homes sell for more compared to those with lower EPC ratings . <p> Solid wall insulation- makes one of the biggest increases in your EPC rating " sometimes bumping it up by 2 whole bands , so as we know from that earlier article , this is going to improve the value of your property . The question is , should solid wall ( and particularly external wall ) insulation be something everyone considers when they are renovating a property for sale . Should it be something a property developer considers ? <h> Grants make solid wall insulation work <p> External insulation is heavily subsidised by the GDHIF scheme , so for smaller properties you are going to get a discount of around two thirds on the cost . For larger properties , the grant funding is capped , but you will still see discounts of a third or more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , there is significant up front cost for the homeowner . So can insulation improve the value ? <h> Benefits of EWI <p> If you add loft insulation , there are 2 main benefits that could affect the price " the boost in EPC rating , and the warmer feel of the home . It is not very visible however , and is n't likely to sit in a buyer 's mind very long . <p> External insulation is a completely different kettle of fish . As well as the obvious increase in EPC rating and warmer feel in the property , external insulation has another added benefit " it makes the property look amazing . In a week your property will go from old tatty looking brickwork or render , to a clean rendered neutral finish . The difference is really stark , and for some properties this is going to make a massive difference to the curb appeal . It also makes for a great time to deal with any other issues like damaged guttering or cills . <h> Keeping period features maintains value <p> On a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveals and detailing can really add to the value of the property , and a simple EWI job would involve stripping these features for a simple smooth finish . <p> Of course , this will negatively influence house price , and it is far better to either work around these features as best you can , leaving the detail exposed . For additional cost , you could also get the features replicated and added back on over the top of the insulation . This will produce the best finish , but potentially add thousands to the cost of the job . <h> Exactly how much value will EWI add ? <p> This is a really hard one to estimate , because EWI has not been around in the UK that long , and there is not sufficient data to draw worthwhile conclusions . It is pretty certain however that EWI will have a huge influence on the value of- property , because of the huge visual impact and the boost in energy performance . Now you can have a period property with an efficiency similar to a modern one . 184574 @qwx384574 184572 @qwx384572 
@@36749040 @5749040/ <h> Green Companies 2017 : Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay Plc <h> February 14 , 2017 <p> Following last weeks feature on kite power , we are now focusing on tidal lagoon power , a technology also expected to make an impact in the next few days . Weve written about Swansea Tidal Lagoon before , but until now it has seemed speculative . Its been a long planning process , drawn out by delays in approval and funding. - But now the project has- finally been given the green light , and will start extensive building next year . <p> Swansea Tidal Lagoon is an exciting development , because it could be a huge , reliable source of- green energy and also a world first ! The lagoon is expected to produce 320MW , enough to power 155,000 homes each year . Aside from increasing renewable energy generation in the UK , and helping to ease increasing pressure on the National Grid , and it could also be a great economic export . There are already plans for a much larger 2.7GW lagoon in Cardiff once this pathfinder project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model here . <p> As far as the environmental impact goes , extensive tests were conducted before the project being given the final go-ahead . While the people in charge are keen to stress that damage to ecosystems will be limited , it is difficult to predict exactly in advance . It is clear , though , that the company are taking this seriously ; they are employing marine biology experts to plan how best to limit disturbance to fish and cultivate new species in controlled conditions . The bottom line is that no large infrastructure project , and no form of renewable energy generation , will be entirely without consequences for the environment however good the intentions . But green energies are infinitely preferable to those which produce huge carbon emissions . A recent independent review said- that it is hard to find an energy source where people are more instinctively supportive than tidal power. <p> We spoke to Ioan Jenkins , Development Director for Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay Plc , about the current status of the project and what it hopes to achieve . <h> There has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and building progress has been stunted for a while for various reasons what stage are you at now ? <p> The publication of the Government 's Independent Review by Charles Hendry has set the final piece of the jigsaw in place. - We are now continuing discussions with Government and look forward to working with ministers and officials to bring this new industry to life . <h> Have you got a date for when you expect the tidal lagoon to be operational ? <p> We hope to start on site in Spring 2018- which means that we will power on in 2022. - <h> What problems have you encountered in the planning and approval stages ? <p> We have been very fortunate to have the support and backing of the local community , industry and politics . The Development Consent Order was granted in June 2015 following a very detailed examination process . <h> What is special about Swansea as a location ? <p> Swansea Bay has a fantastic tidal range with an average tide of 9m . <h> Will the lagoon- produce constant levels of power at all times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , the lagoon will not produce constant energy output at all times . Over a 24-hour period , it will produce energy as four distinct pulses , with each pulse lasting about 3.5 hours and each pulse separated from the next one by about 2.5 hours . So energy output is intermittent , but also totally predictable . Output also depends on the stage of the tide ; spring tides give higher levels of overall energy output than neap tides . But there will always still be these 4 pulses during the day . <h> Is this a pilot for potential bigger projects going forward ? <p> Yes , we hope to deliver a fleet of six lagoons in UK waters that will generate around 10% of the UK 's power requirements . <h> Will it be coupled with an energy storage solution ? <p> At the moment there is no proposal to couple Swansea Bay tidal lagoon with an energy storage solution . But it is always possible to add energy storage at a later stage . <h> How far ahead can you predict tide times ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We believe that the project will have a net benefit for the environment . There are detailed reports on environmental considerations online here . 184565 @qwx384565 <p> Although one tidal lagoon can not produce constant or continuous power , a fleet of lagoons around the coast , because of the predictability of the tides , can provide a continuous input into the national grid .

@@36749041 @5749041/ <h> Is living off grid realistic ? <h> November 13 , 2015 <h> It is realistic to live off grid ? <p> Living off grid means that you are not connected to , or rely on the national grid for your energy needs . This will probably involve some sort of energy storage system to ensure that you have a constant supply of electricity . Your heating might be electric , use a renewable heating source , or perhaps a wood burner . Is this a good idea ? What are the pros and cons ? We discuss here . <h> Perception and living off grid <p> For many years , those who lived completely off grid were considered eccentric , or perhaps eco-warriors of some sort . These days , that is less the case , as the practicalities become somewhat more straight-forward and the technologies easier and cheaper to access . <p> Solar PV prices have shot down , as has wind turbine technologies , whilst biomass boilers and wood burners have become much more popular . It is now possible to live off grid , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferring to perhaps embrace some of these technological innovations without going the whole hog and losing their electricity connection . <p> We are fortunate to live in a country where the electricity supply is very reliable , and blackouts are very few and far between . It is expected that this might be less the case in the future , as Britain 's coal power plants close and replacements lag behind . <h> Wood as an alternative fuel <p> If you are not going to use grid gas or electricity to heat your home , then you may look to wood as an alternative fuel in the form of a wood burning or biomass boiler . This is only really practical in properties with plenty of space to store the wood and probably outside of city areas . You could also benefit from a very generous government subsidy for biomass , as long as you use an approved source for your wood . <p> So wood or other biomass fuel is a really good option for off grid heating " reliable , and cost effective , but it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood burning stove even in urban parts of London show that it is a great way to provide affordable heat . <h> Where to get your electricity ? <p> If getting a regular oil delivery is possible , you could run a generator for your electricity . Long term this is going to be pretty expensive however , with oil prices likely to rise in the coming years . Most people considering moving off grid want to look at renewable options to provide a more independent system not reliant on a regular fuel delivery . <p> There are a few places to get your electricity renewably " from solar PV or from wind . In certain places it might be possible to harness more unusual forms of generation , like micro hydroelectric for example , but these are going to be very dependent on location and also going to be much more expensive than the more conventional renewables . <h> Battery storage <p> The biggest issue with generating electricity on your own is not how you generate the energy , it is the problem of a constant supply . Power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the grid . Solar PV will only provide power during daylight hours , and wind power will only provide electricity when the wind is blowing . Combining the two technologies mean that you will nearly always have some electricity , but you need a steady supply to make sure all your appliances are working through the day . And that means batteries . <p> For many years , battery storage for renewables was too expensive , and only an option for those who were going off grid for green rather than financial reasons . Battery storage recently has become cheaper and with global battery prices dropping , it is going to become more feasible to have a good consistent supply of electricity without having to rely on the grid . Feasibility does not mean that it is worth it though ! It usually doubles or triples the cost of a renewable energy install . <h> Is going off grid financially worthwhile ? <p> For the vast majority of people it is going to be a better option to get solar or wind power installed , and then take advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is only the cost of the renewable system involved , and you do n't have to worry about power outages most of the time . If you go off grid , you wo n't get the feed in tariff , nor will you have the reliability that this brings in terms of energy supply . You will need to invest in expensive batteries and back up generators to ensure that you have a steady supply of electricity . <p> So the best approach for the moment is to stay grid tied , utilising solar and wind along with grid electricity . When it comes to heating however , it is much easier to be off the grid these days , with different heating methods like solar thermal , biomass , wood burners etc all able to heat a home very well without needing to rely on the gas or electric grid . In some cases , it may actually be a cheaper option . <h> 3 comments <p> If you live in a 3rd world country like S.Africa has become , its an entirely different story . getting off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unreliable energy providers and corrupt price-gouging municipalities . Cost is roughly R200K or -10K . Plenty of sun but batteries will need replacing , depending on quality every 5 to 10 years . <p> I have been considering the options with a smallholding where the grid connection costs were astronomical , we are likely opting for solar p.v , circuitree saltwater batteries ( they last 10 15 years ) and a back up generator for the winter , it is not as cost effective as the energy in our current city flat but the grid connection cost has been quoted at -45k , we can buy a premium system for less than half of that and the winter fuel use is only around -150 , so all told in our case it is the the cheapest option by far !

So what can we do to lower our water bills and use less water ? <p> Well , - new dual flush models use as little as 2.6 and 4 litres per flush , so only 20% compared with older toilets , while- composting toilets use no water at all . <h> Dual flush toilets <p> A dual flush toilet is a high efficiency toilet ( HET ) that conserves water by offering a choice of two different toilet- flush volumes a low volume flush for liquids and a full volume flush for solids . These water saving toilets have a much larger trapway ( the hole at the bottom of the bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design ( as opposed to a siphon system ) , so they can use much less water to get the job done. - Since they have the larger trapway , there is much less clogging associated with this type of toilet . The main issue with them is that since they use less water , flushing does n't  always get rid of all the waste so you will be more active with your toilet brush . <p> Replacing an old standard toilet with a new dual flush commode will ensure you use less water when you flush the toilet , however if you do not want to go as far as replacing the toilet , you can retrofit the dual flush functionality onto an older style toilet . The bowl will still use the siphon system to get rid of the wate , but you will get to choose whether you use the partial or full flush . <h> Pressure assisted toilets <p> Pressure assisted toilets are used more in commercial premises that in the residential setting since they are more expensive to buy and install and they are louder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are a water saving toilet and they leave the bowl cleaner because the flush is stronger and the water level in the bowl is higher .

They work by displacing- water in your cistern so that the volume of water in your flush is reduced by between 1 " 3 litres. - Please note , that you do not need a cistern displacement device if you have a dual flush toilet , also if you are going to install a displacement device be sure it does not get in the way of any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues . <h> Composting toilets <p> The most water-efficient type of toilet is the composting toilet , which typically is a completely dry toilet , relying on aerobic processing to treat the waste . In this type of toilet , the solid waste is composted by microbes , while the urine is diverted off ( as too much moisture in the process can lead to anaerobic decomposition which results in nasty odours ) . The solid waste is often mixed with a bulking agent such as sawdust to increase the surface area for the microbes to do their work . These tend to be found in places that have no suitable water supply but may be suitable if you have a large garden in your property . <h> The importance of saving water <p> Saving water is important in the- UK- despite the fact that it appears to rain a lot throughout the summer and winter months .

Depending on what you are precisely after , either getting- wet render or tidying up existing render , then this blog will actually try and address those points . We have thought about problems encountered- by our readers , whether on a current project or refurbishment . Here is a comprehensive list of things to do if you come across those scenarios . <p> Let 's start with a current project you or your builder may be working on . Now , there is nothing worse than getting those render stains on that newly-laid patio or onto your newish double glazed windows . If you have ever tried to scrape off dried render , it can be a nightmare . And if you are not careful , can leave marks , especially on glass or fragile surfaces .

You will be left with marks that are expensive to repair . Repeat what we said above , and use an appropriate liquid solution that is designed for these uses . <h> Hide bad render with external wall insulation <p> We get a lot of calls from people who have moved into properties rendered in a colour or grain they hate , especially if they have pebbledash .

Now when I say basic , I do n't mean a 20 year old malfunctioning dial on the wall that only works when you take a sledge hammer to it , but a full on wireless piece of kit that links seamlessly to my boiler . The programmer " while a bit annoying in the fact that the buttons are n't terribly responsive " worked well and gave me the option to add regular time slots as well as a day by day setting . But still I was getting frustrated . This was n't enough for my busy ' mid-twenties London lifestyle , where my plans frequently changed on a day-to-day basis . <p> Like anyone , I do n't like working late , however this was n't because of missing my favourite TV show or my dinner , it was because I knew I was pointlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was so paranoid that I once texted someone I knew on my street to go and turn my heating off " they were n't best pleased ! I thought that the time had come to replace this so called , modern wireless thermostat and programmer . So I took the plunge and went for the Tado . It 's been 2 weeksand this is what I think : <h> Installing the Tado Intelligent Heating- Controller <p> I was debating over paying the -50 or so quid for a professional installer , just to make sure that I did n't electrocute myself . However , I thought that I could n't write a review on all aspects of the Tado unless I went for it myself , and I have to say I made the correct decision and would n't recommend anyone getting a professional ; unless you have the DIY skills of a donkey and fingers to match . <p> Following the step-by-step guide on the website makes it extremely easy , as you seamlessly go through everything from registering the devices ( 3 in total ) , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem at this stage was the fact that unlike the Nest , there are 3 . There is a separate small box that has to be plugged into your WiFi router , as well as the receiver " which is wired to your boiler , and the thermostat " which is actually very discrete and can actually pass for a coaster ( a mistake made by most of my visitors until I installed it on the wall ) . So with the install relatively stress free and taking around 45 minutes , it was on to testing it . <h> What does the Tado Intelligent Heating Control offer ? <p> So there are 3 settings on the Tado : <p> There are 3 basic settings on the Tado <p> 1 : Off " or , as I like to call , frost protection mode , as it only turns the heating on when the thermostat reads 5 degrees . <p> 2 : Manual " which turns your smart phone ( provided you have 3G or WiFi ) , or any computer linked to WiFi into a thermostatic controller . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed if you find it gets a bit chilly in the night , or turn it down if you 're on the exercise bike or similar temperature raising activities . The important thing is that you can have 0.1 degree control over your temperature from any area that has 3G or WiFi . <p> 3 : Auto " the clever stuff ! But basically allows you to set two different temperatures so splits your heating into up-and-about and in-bed mode . Auto mode also uses Geo-fencing so it can see where you are , to make sure that you do n't unnecessarily heat your home when you are n't there . <p> So three fairly simple settings that should not only save you money but also increase comfort . <p> A look at some of the available settings on the Tado <p> After the couple of weeks , I 've found myself switching between all three . Over the weekend , I love the auto mode as I have the temperature set to 20 throughout the day and 16 when I 'm asleep and in bed . The Geo-fencing also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wake up in a different city after a couple too many " has n't happened to me I have to say , but for some it may prove useful ! Now importantly if your phone ends up in Scotland but you end up at home , all you have to do is logon to the Tado on your computer and set the temperature from there . The one problem I have found , hence why I often switch to the manual mode , is that even when I 'm a few miles away it still thinks I 'm popping to the shops as opposed to sitting in the office all day . The closer you get , the closer it gets to your set temperature ; the further away , the colder it gets . The reason why I often switch from Auto mode to Manual is that Geofencing drains your battery fairly quickly , but the switch only takes a click and from there on in you can just set the temperature manually . Although the nice warm orange of the Auto mode is replaced by a greyalmost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from their most intelligent mode . Turning it to off , or frost mode , gives me a nice picture of grass , trees and a sunset , congratulating me on improving the environment ! <p> The other smart features are that it logs a continuous graph that shows the history of your room temperature and when the boiler has been on , which I find fascinating as you can see how quickly ( or slowly ) your house loses heat , and therefore how poorly insulated it is " No marks for me on this one as my cooling down gradient looks like Everest . <p> The Tado let 's you see graphs of your heating over time and how quickly your home is losing heat . <p> Tado also tries to give you how much it thinks it has saved you since you have had it . For mein just over 2 weeks it seems to think I have saved -0.77 per day that is actually a decent chuck out of my heating bill for my 2 bed flat . <p> So for me , it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even mind if there were no savings , because in all honesty it is fun and my house is cosier and more inviting than ever . <p> Tado is filling a very neglected market in the USA . We have and love our Nest product so when I read about TADO being able to control Split Ductless AC units I was very excited . Split ductless has been used in Europe for much longer because of their construction techniques and ability to integrate into older homes . <p> This unit has worked flawlessly since we got it . Initial setup was easy . When I did have a problem with my wifi SSID changing , I called them and tech support emailed me instructions on how to reconfigure . <p> Its more a question than a comment .

( This is a joke ? ? ! ! ) Tado said they are not doing anything about it , because my data will only be stored in Munich , not with Google . So my question is , is this true ? When I first downloaded Tado , the location service automatically hooked up with Google Map . I could trace my own movement back via the Google Map on my phone . Is it accurate for Tado to say that my location data would not be stored at Google ? Please enlighten me ! Many thanks . <p> Hi , nice little review ! i have had Tado now for around 2 months , everything works perfectly apart from Auto app on android phone , Complete disaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rarely recognises when we leave or when we come home .

Ill have a chat to the guys at Tado to see if this is a common theme when running it through Android , although I think it may just be a lack of GPS/3G. 
@@36749047 @5749047/ <h> What are piezoelectric materials ? <p> Piezoelectric materials are materials that produce an electric current when they are placed under mechanical stress . The piezoelectric process is also reversible , so if you apply an electric current to these materials , they will actually change shape slightly ( a maximum of 4% ) . <p> There are several materials that we have known for some time that posses piezoelectric properties , including bone , proteins , crystals ( e.g. Quartz ) and ceramics ( e.g. Lead Zirconate Titanate ) . <p> However , in May 2012 , it was announced that- University of California Berkeley- lab scientists have found a mechanism of harnessing piezoelectricity from viruses . This is the first time a biological material has been used to make piezoelectricity . <h> Why are piezoelectric materials of interest ? <p> Imagine walking down the street and charging your phone as you walk , charging your laptop by typing , or powering a nightclub by dancing on a piezoelectric floor ! The concept of piezoelectricity has been around since the 1880s and was discovered by Jacques and Pierre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create the spark that ignites the gas , using it as an everyday energy source is still a long way off . <h> Issues with current piezoelectric materials <p> There are 3 issues that we are currently faced with in trying to tap into piezoelectricity as a viable electricity production method : <p> The major issue one is that the quantity of electricity produced is so small , so unless vast installations were set up , it simply would not have the strength to power our latest gadgets . <p> The current is only produced when there is mechanical stress being applied , so as soon as you stop compressing the material , there is no charge produced . <p> The final issue is that up to now , many of the starting products needed to produce the piezoelectric materials are toxic and difficult to work with . <h> Why newly identified viral piezoelectric material could be the answer <p> There are many reasons why this finding could revolutionise the piezoelectric field . Firstly , viruses replicate incredibly quickly , producing millions of identical viruses within hours , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a virus , scientists can relatively easily genetically engineer it , thereby improving its piezoelectric characteristics . The virus itself is shaped as a rod , so when many come into contact , they naturally orient themselves into a amazingly organised film . <p> If you look at the- Windstalker- technology , you will see that the engineers behind it looked at ceramic piezoelectric materials being positioned within the wind stalks to harness the wind 's energy . This new research completed by the Berkeley lab , could make this potential technology more viable , as there is now a cheaper source of the piezoelectric material . <h> The future of piezoelectricity <p> Piezoelectricity is an exciting field of- Nanotechnology , and there are already tests being run outside labs to try and harness this form of power . In many places including Japan 's subway , dance floors across the world and football stadiums , engineers have already put in place piezoelectric floors that use the high volume of footfall to decrease their demand for electricity from the grid .

As 35% of heat is lost through the walls of a property , anything you can do to reduce this means a more constant- temperature and lower energy bills . <p> It can have some downsides insulation can encourage- damp and mould if not installed correctly and adding to walls encroaches on room space but if done properly it can be an effective way to insulate . <p> There are a number of options as to which insulating material you go- for it depends on the condition of your walls , the space available , and the budget . <p> Before you choose the type of insulation , you need to decide how it will be fixed to the wall .

@@36749049 @5749049/ <h> UK tax exemptions for property energy efficiency improvements <h> March 6 , 2016 <p> The UK has a policy gap in its implementation of energy efficiency measures for both domestic and commercial consumers . Since the demise of the domestic Green Deal and a series of rather confusing Government set of policies since late 2015 , the energy efficiency sector lacks the right incentives for large scale take-up of measures that could improve the existing energy inefficient properties . <p> Energy efficiency take-up- needs to improve- as the UK still has one of the most energy inefficient property stock in the whole of Europe and millions still remain in fuel poverty . <h> Financial schemes for energy efficiency property improvements <p> We have energy- audited a- high number of buildings both in both- domestic and commercial sectors in the big metropolitan areas ( London , Glasgow , Manchester , Birmingham , etc ) and- have interviewed 1000s of residents in those buildings , and our results have produced a profile which confirms that the quality of energy efficiency in the UK property sector is fairly low compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents that occupy those buildings has been fairly consistent most concluding that there- is currently a lack of financially attractive incentives to help manage the upfront cost- of installing the energy efficient measure improvements in the first place . <p> Financial incentives for energy efficiency investment usually take the following- formats : <p> Financial property improvement loan ( commercial rates ) ; <p> Pay-as-you-save schemes ( Green Deal Finance , PACENow , etc ) <p> Grants &amp; subsidies ( FiTs , RHI , GDHIF , etc ) <p> Tax exemptions , credits or reductions . <p> Previous blogs have covered pay-as-you-save finance schemes and government grant incentives in quite a bit of detail , but in this publication we are evaluating tax exemptions- and the energy efficiency as a standalone subject area . <h> Why are tax exemptions for energy efficiency improvements back on the agenda ? <p> Tax exemptions are back on the agenda because they appear to be the least controversial area to talk about when dealing with energy policy . Subsidies like the Green Deal Home Improvement Fund , FiTs , RHI and other green grants have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the tax payer . On the other hand , the tax exemptions or credits back to the individual for investing in energy efficiency measures have proven to be popular in other western economies , most notably the United States . Therefore we understand why its easier for policy makers to be talking about them with more enthusiasm in the current economic climate . <p> The tax system has been cited by the Policy Exchange ( a prominent thinktank ) as the best way to incentivise new home owners to be rewarded for purchasing an energy efficient home . The independent report calls for a -5,000 stamp duty cut for any new home buyer buying a new property that has a good energy efficiency rating . On the other hand , customers should be penalised for the same amount ( -5,000 additional stamp duty ) for purchasing a property that has a poor rating in the end the policy should be tax neutral . <p> We believe this is a step in the right direction and according to the research , this policy change ( were it to go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more energy efficient dwellings . <p> However according to government statistics , in the- UK in 2015 some- 1.3m properties- were exchanged both in the domestic and commercial sectors . 270,000 homes marked as energy efficient- are only a small fraction of the total portfolio being exchanged therefore the question is : what- happens to occupiers who inherit or live in an existing property that has a poor energy efficiency rating ? <p> Also , the -5,000- stamp duty cut would only apply to high value properties and not to moderate sized family homes , which would only see a fraction of that rebate . <h> What can we learn from previous tax exemption schemes in the UK ? <h> Landlord Energy Saving Allowance <p> Up until April 2015 , landlords in England &amp; Wales were able to claim a tax deduction from their annual self-assessment if they had invested in energy efficiency measures on their properties . This scheme was know as the Landlords Energy Saving Allowance and is now closed . <p> It is difficult to know how successful this scheme actually was but the -1,500 help it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right intentions for potential energy efficiency improvements . <h> 5% Reduced VAT on energy efficiency improvements <p> The installation of many energy efficiency measures such as insulation , solar panels , heat pumps and energy efficient heating controls qualifies the customer for a reduced 5% VAT rate and any other associated works to have that installed . This has helped 1000s of consumers avoid the full VAT charge and certainly helped make energy efficient investment decisions more likely . <p> However , this policy tool may soon be consigned to the scrap heap as it has been successfully challenged by the European Union competition bodies and deemed in breach of the council- directive/s . Our advice is : if you are planning an external wall insulation installation or an expensive biomass boiler then this is the time to move forward with the decision before the VAT rate is moved back to the standard rate . <p> While these- are the most common examples where tax exemptions were applied in the UK system , other examples are few and far between . The tax exemption model as previously mentioned has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been applied at both national and local levels . <h> Tax exemptions that could make a difference <p> While stamp duty is a taxation that could impact the energy efficiency of a property on exchange , other help through the tax system should be explored to help millions of other property owners or occupiers move forward . <h> Tax allowance for self-assessments <p> Like the LESA that worked for landlords in the past , perhaps it is time for a universal allowance that would take into account energy efficiency improvements made by all owners . Therefore even capping this to up to -500 per year for insulation upgrades , energy efficient heating systems and renewable system investments would be a start to help stimulate a national drive towards energy efficiency . <p> The issues here would be the admin headache for millions of self-assessment tax payers and the tax bodies that- are there to enforce these financial benefits . <h> Council tax rebates <p> Council- taxes- are- extremely- important to fund local services , and changes seen here to reduce what people pay based on how energy efficient the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> To do this the mechanism for rating the energy efficiency of the properties , the energy performance certificate ( EPC ) could become the key tool here to determine how much of a council tax reduction the consumers could be entitled to . <p> However , although the EPCs are now quite common for buying and selling a property , the issue is their validity and accuracy . Whilst an EPC in theory can be valid for 10 years , the underlying assumptions used to derive property energy efficiency have changed over the years . Therefore an EPC issued in 2008 can have a considerable difference in rating even if the- same date was used to derive the same certificate but with 2016 software . Therefore some sort of timeframe should be put onto the issue date of when the EPC could be used . <p> Finally , it is worth mentioning that council tax has been one of the toughest forms of taxation to reform over the years . Therefore it will need a lot of political will from both central and local Governments to see any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element on energy saving measures only <p> The actual EU Court of Justice ruling specifically states that it deems it be illegal for the reduced VAT rate to be applied to measures where materials are the largest element of the cost of the renovation works to private dwellings ; however this wont- necessarily also- apply to the labour element of the project . For example , while measures such as solar PV , solar thermal and heat pumps will be severely affected ( as the cost of the kit is pretty high ) , external wall insulation installation could still benefit from an amended policy as the labour element is the most significant part of the cost of the job . <p> The Governments- final- position- will be clarified- post-Budget 2016 . <h> Reforms to UK Consumer- Energy Efficiency Policy 2016/17 <p> The Department of Energy &amp; Climate Change appointed- Dr.- Peter Bonfield from the BRE to conduct an independent review into the state of the consumer energy efficiency policy in the UK . According to the terms of reference document , the initial report findings are to be reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of Spring 2016 with no set date yet for full published findings and a date set for implementation to the market . <p> We therefore wait to see whether the Policy Exchanges findings on UK tax exemptions are to be reported back and included in the full Bonfield review . Including some moderate tax incentives ( examples mentioned above ) along with other measures ( a new and reformed pay-as-you-save scheme ) would be some steps in the right direction to helping kick off a better take-up of energy efficiency measures . 184565 @qwx384565 <p> What a mess we are in ! Public policy on this has got to be sorted . What I believe we need is to have an independent agency that assesses every UK building over a 20 year period , starting with the worst buildings and then doing it all over again when the cycle is complete . They need to focus on outcomes heat loss and energy wasted . Where buildings are not meeting high standards then low cost loans , backed by Central Government should be available .

This is a region of very high unemployment . Many people would be given a job for the first time doing this work and the saving in benefits payments would be very great indeed . The scheme should then be rolled out across the country . <p> One final point : given the assessment , loan arranging , carrying out of the work and reassessment on completion would all be labour intensive , reducing VAT for all this work might be possible , even if the assessment and reassessment costs are borne by Central Government

However even until very recently , building standards were not sufficient to create what we would consider an efficient property . <p> Most housing in London was built well before building regulations really took effect and therefore it is fair to say that the majority is poorly insulated and fitted with inefficient heating systems .

You can insulate with either external or internal insulation and there is funding available to do so . <p> Timber floors in the majority of the home with cold solid concrete floor kitchens " It is fairly typical on Victorian terraces to see floorboards in the main area of the property and solid concrete floors in the extension . You should draught proof your floorboards using Draughtex and look at floor insulation " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sash windows " Large single glazed sash windows are fairly typical on homes built in this era . Sash window double-glazing is expensive , and there is usually a cheaper option like refurbishment or draught proofing . You can read more on this here .

This is great news for you , because cavities are very easily insulated and can make a big difference to your bills " they are simply injected from the outside with cavity wall insulation . <p> Suspended timber floors- Most 1930 's homes have timber floors , which can be either insulated or draught proofed . <p> Draught Proofing " Once again these homes could well be draughty so it is worth looking at getting your doors and windows draught proofed . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is n't always the case , but flat roofs became popular post-war , and were rarely well insulated .

You should look into wall insulation " this could be either cavity or solid wall . <p> Flats / Mid-High Rise " Flats present their own problems because the envelope of your home includes other people 's property , although having said that , where you have a party wall with a neighbour there should be no heat loss , so actually if you are in the middle of a block of flats this may actually be an advantage in terms of energy efficiency . <h> 1970s London Properties : <p> Cavity Walls " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulation was fitted as standard , but it is still worth checking your cavity walls , as these were generally not insulated . <p> Watch out for old boilers / electric heating ( off grid / now on grid but still with electric heating ) " The 1970 's was a time of energy uncertainty . Some properties were built without a gas supply and therefore use electric storage heaters . Others have even more unconventional heating systems like back boilers , gas room heaters and electric ceiling heating that could be costing you money . Look at whether you can change to gas central heating or take advantage of the RHI for renewable heating such as heat pumps . <h> Modern London Properties : <p> If you live in a relatively modern house , your cavity walls should have already been filled , but there are a few things you can still look out for : <p> Loft Insulation top-up " Usually these properties have some loft insulation , but it may be worth getting a top up .

@@36749054 @5749054/ <h> Waste Water Heat Recovery Systems <h> Heating <h> What is a WWHRS and how does it work ? <p> Typically , a waste water heat recovery system works by extracting the heat from the water your shower or bath sends down the drain . This heat is used to warm the incoming mains water , reducing the strain on your boiler and the energy required to heat your water up to temperature . A system normally takes the form of a long vertical copper pipe , where the warm water runs alongside the colder mains water to exchange the heat . <p> The devices are typically around 60% efficient , so they convert 60% of the potential energy in the waste water back into heat for the incoming water . This can save you money on your bills , especially if you use a lot of hot water in your home . The payback period as we will discuss is another matter . <p> The good news is that it is a fairly simple device .

So you are looking at over a -1,000 to get a unit in your home . <h> Are they worth it ? <p> Until 2015 , installers often used WWHRSs as a means to get a new home up to Sustainable Homes Code standards , rather than a means to save money .

@@36749055 @5749055/ <h> Types of biomass boiler <h> Heating <h> Choosing a biomass boiler <p> Domestic biomass boilers are usually divided into the following categories : moving grate , plane grate , batch fired and stoker . Here we will look at each of these systems to help you decide which is best for you . <h> Moving grate <p> The most flexible , but also the most expensive type of system , the moving grate sometimes called inclined or step-grate requires considerable combustion space and additional equipment . The fuel is shuffled into the combustion chamber using stepped grates , which cause the fuel to dry quickly and then combust . By varying the grate speed , you can allow for a wide variety of fuel with varying moisture content ( usually up to 60% ) . As combustion occurs , ash is produced , which falls off the end of the grate . <p> These are commonly found in northern Europe , including the UK , because of the wide availability of moist softwood fuels . <p> Advantages <p> Wide range of moisture content and particle sizes , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Higher efficiency <p> Disadvantages <p> Can have a long warm-up time with wetter fuels <p> Low load operation can lead to higher maintenance costs <p> Higher capital costs <h> Plane grate systems <p> In these systems , the combustion chamber is smaller and the feed is underneath or side fed . These systems are ideal for use with drier fuels with a moisture content below 35% . Ash is augured from the bottom of the chamber or removed manually . <p> Advantages <p> Smaller combustion chamber and less refractory material means that these systems can be situated in a smaller space than other systems <p> They can also operate on multiple fuel types , allowing flexibility <p> A simpler design means that it will be cheaper than a moving grate system <p> Disadvantages <p> Due to the smaller combustion chamber , the moisture content of the fuel must be lower , and as a result higher quality fuel is needed . <h> Stoker burner systems <p> These systems are more straightforward than either plane grate or moving grate and generally around 30-500kW systems . Fuel is augured into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means switching between fuel types is quicker <p> It is ideal if there are down periods when no heat is required as it uses very little fuel to maintain ignition <p> They are also usually cheaper than grate systems because of their simplicity <p> Disadvantages <p> Fuel must be dry ( below 35% ) , the particle and moisture level must be consistent due to the very small combustion zone <p> In smaller systems , the lack of variable air supply means fine-tuning for varying fuel types is not possible <h> Batch fired systems <p> Fed manually with a range of possible fuels , this system requires little input other than daily filling the hopper . They burn their fuel in bursts , rather than slow and continuous with fans fitted to ensure complete combustion . Typically the system is under 500kW . <p> Advantages <p> Where the fuel and labour are available at low cost , this is a cheap and simple choice <p> There is also less maintenance required <p> Disadvantages <p> Daily manual input required <p> Fuel must be below 25% moisture content <p> Lower efficiency than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From a technical and economic point of view , it is best to have your boiler running continually , at between 30-100% capacity . Generally , biomass plants do not work well with huge variations in load . As such , certain applications are going to be more efficient and cost effective . Process applications where the load required is similar 24/7 ( such as swimming pools or manufacturing plants ) , will be more cost-effective than heating applications where the load changes dramatically between summer and winter , and night and day . Daily and seasonal heat demand needs to be considered to properly size a system . <p> When sizing a system , it is important to consider the variations in demand over the year , and consequently whether you are using the system to cater to the base load , the peak load or , as is usually the case , a balance of the two . <p> By catering to the base load only , the system will provide all the heat required during the time of the year with the lowest demand , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high demand . The advantage of this is that the plant is operated continually at the same level , which is ideal for a biomass system . It is cheaper than a larger peak load system , and it provides lower cost per unit of carbon saved . <p> Catering to peak demand means ensuring that the system can deal with the periods of maximum demand , with spare capacity during periods of low demand . The advantages of this is that it can provide all the heat required for the property , maximise carbon savings , lower the unit installed costs , and it removes the need for back-up generation . <p> Usually a compromise is reached , taking into account the costs of the additional capacity versus the cost of using grid heating during the periods of higher load . Those eligible for the Renewable Heat Incentive must also factor in the income from this , and the carbon savings you need to make . It is a tricky balance , that will be different for every business , but it is well worth crunching the numbers before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are several different ways to integrate your system to help deal with the varying load . <h> Biomass plant with buffer tank <p> This is where a heat store is used to save heat generated when the demand is lower than capacity , and then used when demand is high . For daily changes in demand , the heat store can allow the plant to run at a constant level , saving heat generated at one time and releasing it during periods of high demand . During seasonal changes in demand , the heat store can allow the system to turn on and off less frequently , reducing operational costs . <p> The Carbon Trust suggests that the buffer should be around 10 litres/kW of plant capacity where loads do not fall to zero , rising to 20 litres/kW where they do . <h> Biomass plant with fossil fuel back-up <p> This is where typically an oil or LPG system is used as backup to the biomass , either to meet peak load , or to provide heat at times of base load , when using the biomass system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful where it is essential to have an uninterrupted heat supply ( e.g. a hospital ) . It can also be used as redundancy if the main system ever fails . <h> Biomass plant with buffer and fossil fuel back-up <p> Using both systems will obviously have a higher initial upfront cost , but has the advantage of combining the benefits of both systems . This maximises the heat generated by the biomass , whilst providing a backup system able to cope with any eventuality at the same time . <h> Installing a Biomass Boiler <p> Are you thinking installer map . 184568 @qwx384568 184572 @qwx384572

The whole how hot should my house be ' topic is a bit of a contentious issue so I will take you through some of the key points and try to give you a better idea of the temperature that 's right for your home . <h> What does the government say about temperature ? <p> A recent government study found that in the UK , the average temperature of a home is 17.7-C , whilst the recommended level is 21-C ( 70-F ) . This discrepancy in temperatures has been used to show how fuel poverty was preventing people from heating their homes to a comfortable temperature " it is estimated that 2.5m people are currently living in fuel poverty . <p> This is really oversimplified though , because some people will need higher temperatures " like the elderly or i 'll whilst the average person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a little odd for the Government to recommend this relatively high temperature when it is trying to reduce energy consumption . <p> To be honest , the majority of people can live very comfortably at a temperature well below 21-C , so do n't just set the thermostat at this temperature- out of habit ! <h> Using a thermostat to set temperature <p> Many people use a thermostat to set their temperature , but you need to make sure it is set up correctly . A thermostat works by recording the ambient air temperature around it . If the temperature of the air is lower than the thermostat , it will send a message to the boiler to fire up , while if the temperature of the air is higher , it will tell the heating system to switch off . <p> Therefore , a thermostat positioned right by your draughty front door is going to kick in at a lower temperature than one in your living room . In this case , even though you are setting your thermostat to 21-C by the door , the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As a result , it is really important to know your house and how warm you need it , rather than just setting it at a certain level and forgetting about it . You can negate this by using a wireless thermostat that you can place where you like . <h> Insulation is just as important as your thermostat <p> It 's no good setting your thermostat to save energy if you are inefficient to begin with . You can set your thermostat down at 16-C or 17-C to save money , but if you have no insulation and an old inefficient boiler , you are still going to be spending a fortune , since whatever heat you pump into the home to warm it up , will quickly escape through the walls . If you set the thermostat to 25-C in a poorly insulated house , it might not even get that warm , because the rate of heat loss will be just too high . So increasing the amount of insulation in the loft , on the walls and under the floor is key to being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs you money <p> Every house will vary , but the generally accepted rule is that for every degree you increase your thermostat , you will be paying an extra -60 a year . This is because your boiler needs to work harder to get the temperature up if you have electric heating the savings could be even higher . <p> For larger or more inefficient homes , this can be much higher . So bear that in mind when you go to turn up your heating . If you need to be warmer , put on a jumper , or you could try supplementary- heating like an infra-red heating panel . This boosts the temperature in a room with instant heat , without having to turn up your thermostat for the whole house . <h> You should n't be wearing shorts in the winter <p> It is a bit obvious , but you can keep your thermostat down if you wear warmer clothes . A recent study found that some people set their thermostat to 30-C , whilst many were setting it above 25-C . In a poorly insulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay on all day , because that temperature will probably never be reached . These people would save hundreds of pounds a year by setting their thermostat to 21-C or below and wearing some thicker clothes . <h> Different rooms need different temperatures <p> Using only a thermostat means that you could be overheating other rooms in your home . Heating controls are really important . If you have them , use them . If you do n't have them , get them . <h> Look no further than a Heatgenius <p> Thermostatic radiator valves ( TRVs ) let you control the temperature of each room individually . For example , a bedroom can be comfortable at 16-C , whereas a living room needs to be warmer . You can buy smart radiator valves too , that let you control the temperature and heating pattern for each room , which can really save you money . <h> Do n't heat your home when you 're not there <p> It seems simple , but lots of people set their thermostat to 21-C and leave it there , even when they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well , and if you want to control each room while you are out , you can get yourself a remotely controllable tool like a Heatgenius .

Ever since the advent of central heating , people feel like they should be able to walk around their home in a t-shirt in winter , whereas years ago people would wrap- up even in their living room . Whilst there are certain situations where the heating needs to be up high ( an elderly or unwell person in a room ) , you can usually wear a jumper and turn the thermostat down . Do we really need to have the heating up 4 degrees warmer than our parents had it a few decades back ? <h> If you 've tried everything and some rooms just do n't  get warm <p> You may need to invest in a supplementary heater .

Some people will happily turn down their heating in the bedroom but do n't want to wrap up in their living room , while others will put on jumpers and use an extra high tog duvet . At the end of the day , it 's your money " so decide for yourself what you are comfortable with , but do n't set the thermostat to 21-C simply out of habit ! <p> Hi We live in 3 Bed Semi Detached House and we have solid bricks and that means no insulation . When we moved in we removed the old warm air duck system and put Infrared Panels in the entire house as per the calculations done by the provider .

Based on this turning it down to 21 might save you -300 per year . <p> I have just had gas central heating in my council house they have put the thermostat in hall at front door I note you say this is a stupid place for it.also its wireless but keeps losing the signal then suddenly decides its got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on when I ha set it not a problem in evening but my families day starts around 5am I wou like house warm for the first person up and about.any suggestions on how to rectify this as I get the silly women look from the foreman he tells me just to turn it on myself.theyll be back tomorrow for the 5th day for a job that should take 2 or so I was told <p> If it is wireless and running off internal batteries then there should n't be a problem with carefully moving it to your living room , where it should be closer to your boiler and may fix the issues .

You do n't  live in the Hall , so you do n't  really care what temperature it is compared to other rooms , whereas you do n't  want the living room to suddenly shoot up to 25 degrees when someone opens the front door .

@@36749061 @5749061/ <h> Introduction to electric cars <h> What is an electric car ? <p> Put simply , an electric car is a one powered by an electric motor rather than a traditional petrol/diesel engine . This electric motor is powered by rechargeable batteries that can be charged by common household electricity . <h> History of electric cars <h> 1900s <p> Electric cars are nothing new . Interest in motor vehicles increased greatly around the 1900s and at that time there were about twice as many electric cars on the road than petrol/diesel cars . It was n't until the 1920s that interest in electric cars dwindled . The reason was that electric cars were limited by their low top speeds and low range ( just a few miles ) . In addition , in 1912 the electric starter motor was developed for petrol cars , eliminating the traditional drawback of petrol cars : having to use a hand crank to get the car moving ! <p> It was Henry Ford who put the nail in the electric car coffin when his company began to mass-produce the Model T. This slashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an electric car and so in the early 1900s almost all electric car manufacturers began to cease making them . <p> The limited maximum speed of electric cars ( up to 30mph ) limited their practicality . For most of the 20th century , British milk floats made up most of the world 's number of electric vehicles . <p> Interest in electric cars returned following the energy crises of the 1970s and 80s ; with the availability and price of oil being shown to be increasingly volatile , people could see the potential benefits of battery-powered cars . A few big car companies brought out models and some were sold to environmentally-minded members of the public . However , in general electric vehicles were still losing out to the style and lower price of their petrol-fuelled cousins . <h> 2000s <p> In the 2000s , the development of hybrid vehicles , plus another fuel crisis , saw the technology adopted by larger numbers than ever before . Tesla 's Roadster , which went on sale in 2008 , was a game changer for the industry . The attractive design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market than ever before and encouraged competitors such as Nissan and Chevrolet to launch their own models . <p> As of September 2016 , there are more than one million pure electric cars and vans owned globally . <h> How do electric cars work ? <p> There are two types of EV technology : hybrid and pure- electric . <h> Fully electric car <p> The main parts in an electric car are a rechargeable battery , controller and electric motor . First , the battery is powered . Then the controller converts the current from DC-AC so that it can be used by the motor . The motor converts electrical energy to mechanical energy . <h> Hybrid car <p> The same technology exists in hybrid cars , alongside a small gasoline engine running a generator . This powers the car at cruising speed , and batteries provide extra power when accelerating . Batteries can recharge themselves when the car is decelerating or standing still . Hybrid technology means- that your petrol goes much further , saving you money and reducing environmental impact . <h> What are the benefits of electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are better for the planet . <p> They are exempt from road tax and from the London Congestion Charge . <p> They often have a smoother drive than petrol cars . <p> They are cheaper to run . <p> Do not need much maintenance , as they have fewer moving parts . <h> What are the downsides of electric cars ? <p> They can have a- comparatively limited range . This depends on the model , the weather and the style of driving . <p> Depending on the car and the charger , they can take a long time to charge . <p> Batteries may need replacing after 5-10 years in order to retain efficiency . After a few thousand few charges , the battery will lose its ability to hold charge as effectively . <p> Not all parts of the country will have a charging point nearby . <h> How safe are electric cars ? - <p> Electric cars are measured by the same safety standards as standard cars , and many have the highest 5-star ratings . There have been ( very rare ) reports of lithium ion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are installed to ensure this can not happen . These include fuses and circuit breakers , plus coolant run through battery packs to keep them at a low temperature . <p> Fans of petrol cars argue that chemicals in an electric car battery will catch fire in the event of a crash . However , a tank full of petrol is about as flammable as you can get . This is why some people believe electric cars are in fact the safer option . <h> Are electric cars better for the environment ? <p> Electric cars are a more environmentally-friendly option than traditional cars because they produce no tailpipe emissions . However , they are not considered carbon neutral unless the electricity they run on is generated from a renewable source . You can read more about it here . <h> Can I get a grant for an electric car ? <p> You can get a government grant of up to -4,500 for an electric car and -500 towards a home charging point . Check what you could get here . <p> Thank you Samual , yep we are pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding electric car charging points it also has insulation installers ( e.g. cavity wall installers , solid wall installers , loft insulation and so forth ) , heating systems , so new boilers and forms of electric heating . It also has all forms of renewable heating . Think Check-a-trade but specifically including energy saving solutions . Thanks for the shout out though always appreciate a bit of positive feedback ! <p> I am looking to install an electric vehicle charging point at my home in South East London . We have a garage so ideally I would like to get it installed there so I can charge my car during the evening . Is it worth moving to an economy 7 tariff in order to be able to charge the car cheaper , or does the fact it is a car charging point automatically give you cheaper electricity ? Sorry I am new to this , but I love the thought of using the Tesla Model 3 as my nip around town car like scousehero ! <p> I am going to get a Tesla Model 3 when they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finally get onboard ( excuse the pun ) the move to electric cars . Having had a look , they do 215 miles on a full charge which is not that much less than a comparable petrol car . I also have a garage so can install and electric charging point pretty easily I guess ( are there any grants for electric charging points atm ? ) . I guess also that petrol stations will soon be installing the superchargers which can give you 50% charge in the time it takes for me to make a coffee . The final thing and perhaps the most important is that the Model 3 looks cool roll on 2018 = <p> Hi ScouseHero , agreed I think the next couple of years could be massive for the uptake of electric vehicles . Tesla are obviously really helping to bring the idea of electric vehicles to the mainstream . Firstly they are building this massive battery factory over in California , which should really bring down the prices of the batteries due to the economies of scale they are looking to achieve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously help electric cars in the long term with things like quicker charging , longer lasting batteries and so forth . <p> The one thing that Tesla are doing differently to most of the other electric vehicle manufacturers out there is that they are trying to make electric cars directly comparable with traditional petrol cars . Firstly they are designing cars that have extended mileage ( e.g. 200 miles plus ) . Most other manufacturers are producing cars specifically designed for driving around cities with a maximum milage of well under 100 miles . This I think is the game changer . People do n't  want to have to necessarily charge their electric cars each and every night . <p> Secondly ( and this is n't only Tesla ) , electric car companies are building in supercharging functionality so the cars can charge in a far shorter period of time than was historically possible . The new Tesla Model 3 can charge 50% in 20 minutes ! So now even long journeys that do require a recharge do n't  require a night stop over half way ! <p> I think 2017 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It just seems to make sense now that the cost of installer solar pv is so low and also the growth of battery systems here in the US . <p> Hi Mel , I think you are right , electric cars are going to break out next year . Even near where we are a Tesla car dealership is due to open in the next few months ( near the Hammersmith roundabout in London ) . I think Electric cars are really going to hit the mainstream . My only worry about buying one is when you arrive at a service station to recharge and the recharging units are either not working or already being used by other electric car vehicles . I have read though that more and more EV car manufactures are coming out with turbo charges that add 80% charge in 20 mins or so . This will be amazing if 80% can get you 200 miles or so ( which I think the new Tesla might be able to manage . Anyway , exciting times and fingers crossed we can start phasing out Diesel with electric over the coming years .

The Green Deal Finance Company was not helped by being unable to source additional pools of private finance to help with underwriting of new green plans .

@@36749063 @5749063/ <h> An introduction to heat pumps <h> Heating <h> What is a heat pump ? <p> Based on similar technology to air conditioners and freezers , heat pumps use the heat found in air , water or the ground and compress it using electricity . This compression causes the extracted warmth to heat up and then be released into the conditioned space through the use of water within a wet central heating system . <h> The history of the heat pump <p> While heat pumps have been used in a number of different areas for years . The first heat pump is- said to have been built in 1856 and the first ground source heat pump in 1948 . However , it is only within the last few years that popularity has soared , with heat pumps being used for heating both domestic and commercial properties . <p> Heat pumps provide- heat energy from a variety of sources , depending on the model , to a heat sink . In order to work , they are required to shift thermal energy in the opposite direction to natural order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment and release it into a warmer one . Although classed as a renewable heating method , heat pumps tend to use around 1 unit of electricity for every 3-5 units of heat and so are not completely self-sufficient . Their conversion rate is , however , higher than that of radiators . <h> Seasonal performance factor <p> The seasonal performance factor of a heat pump is how much heat energy is generated using one unit of electricity over the course of a year . The higher the SPF , the more heat is generated for the same unit of electricity . Usually , air source heat pumps are around 3 , water source heat pumps around 3.5 and ground source heat pumps around 4 . The reason for the change is the difference in temperature witnessed in each heat source over the seasons . So the outside air temperature falls just when the air source heat pump needs to be providing the most heat , whereas the ground stays at much more of a constant temperature , meaning that the ground source heat pump does n't have to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Important considerations for heat pumps <p> As heat pumps do not heat up water to the same extent as boilers within wet central heating systems , there are some important things to research before you install one . The first is radiator size . If you are replacing your wet central heating system with a heat pump , your current radiators may not be of an adequate size for the rooms . Secondly , as the heat is not of the same temperature as gas , oil and biomass boilers you would need to have a well-insulated house to ensure that the required temperature is reached .

@@36749065 @5749065/ <h> Dinorwig Hydroelectric Plant , Wales <h> Background to the- Dinorwig Hydroelectric Power Plant <p> The Dinorwig hydroelectric power station is an example of a pumped storage power station , where- water is pumped into a reservoir above the turbines ( called Marchlyn Mawr ) when electricity is cheap and demand is low , the gates can then- be opened providing a high supply of energy ( although- for a relatively brief period of time ) to meet demand , as the water rushes through the turbines to the reservoir at the bottom of the power station ( called Llyn Peris ) . <p> The plant construction started in 1974 at a cost of -425m taking a- further 10 years to complete , and is still the largest pumped storage power station in Europe . In total , 16km of underground tunnels deep within Elidir Mountain where excavated , accounting for some 12 million tonnes of rock . To support the tunnels , one million tonnes of concrete , 200,000 tonnes of cement and 4,500 tonnes of steel were required . <p> The six fully reversible turbines sit within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavern in Europe . The turbines are reversible , - allowing water to be pumped back up to the top reservoir when demand for electricity is low ( in the middle of the night for example ) , while also producing an enormous amount of electricity if the water is allowed to follow the natural gravitational path downwards through them . <h> Why Was Dinorwig Chosen for Hydroelectric Power <p> When the water is stored in the top lake the energy that is being stored is known as gravitational potential energy , and the greater the vertical distance between the two lakes , the higher the potential energy stored . This is key to why Dinorwig was chosen , as the vertical drop between the two reservoirs is naturally very large , therefore little additional work had to be undertaken to increase the natural gravitational energy potential . <p> As one might expect pumping the water back up into Marchlyn Mawr ( the top reservoir ) is significantly more energy intensive than the energy it provides when working as a power station , in fact it uses almost 33% more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However where this hydroelectric power plant is unique is the ability to react quickly to meet peak in demand and instantly provide the power required ( unlike Nuclear and Coal power plants ) . It also takes seven hours to pump the water up to the Marchlyn Mawr reservoir , however will only generate power for five hours . <h> Why Is Pumped Storage so Important to the UK <p> This kind of plant is very important to our energy mix in the UK , as most electricity generating plants are very slow to react to changes in demand. - For example nuclear power plants- can take a few days to reach full power from a shut down state , while coal will take hours to fire up and get up to the temperatures required to drive the electrical and- combustion processes . In 12 seconds the plant can go from shut down state to full operating capacity , allowing it to meet- very sudden high demand , such as a TV soap advert break when people put their kettles on ! <p> The plant however does suffer from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the Llyn Peris reservoir at the bottom of the power plant , it can produce no power whatsoever . Therefore , governments need to ensure that the majority of peak demand can be met via the less reactive power stations such as nuclear . <p> Potentially , one might not even consider the Dinorwig as a renewable power station , but simply a means of storing electricity / energy produced by other power stations , however it still has a key role to play in our grid that we rely on every day , vastly increasing our flexibility of supply .

This allows the heating system to learn your behaviour and the temperature you like , and then set the heating accordingly . <p> Some of the older smart thermostats like Nest , ( that is just a single thermostat albeit a smart one ) , will only make these calculations based on one location in the house ; but some of the more advanced smart heating controls ( like the Heat Genius system for example ) have sensors in lots of different locations " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating pattern . <h> Remote controlled electronic TRVs <p> TRVs are the thermostatic valves found on radiators .

Weve written a lot about the technology over the years , but we thought breaking down the 5 key benefits of infrared would be a good introduction for those considering their heating options . <h> Infrared heating is really cheap to run . <p> Unlike traditional forms of heating , it works through radiation , not convection . This safe radiation heats the fabric of the building , as well as the people inside it. - Because it heats walls , floors and ceilings rather than the air , less output is required to reach the same level of warmth . Infrared heats the surface area of a building , rather than its volume . Unlike gas or electric convection heaters , infrared heating is actually 100% efficient , because it converts each unit of electricity used into one unit of useful heat . Installing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires no pipework . The panels can either be simply plugged in or easily wired into the mains for maximum control . <h> Infrared heating looks great ! <p> Unlike ugly , bulky radiators , infrared panels- are almost flat , at a thickness of less than 3cm . You can attach them to your wall or ceiling for a really discreet heating solution . The panels can be customised to fit in any environment ; you can- print them with your favourite picture , or get one disguised as a mirror ! As well as looking stylish , infrared heating panels wont take up space , and because they can go higher up on the wall , you wont have to- worry about blocking them with furniture . <h> Infrared helps dry out walls and- prevent damp . <p> As well as looking horrible and causing potential structural issues in buildings , damp and mould can have nasty health effects . Infrared heating can help- you maintain a healthy environment inside your home is a great side effect of infrared heating . <h> Infrared heating is a powerful heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might find you feel warmer in your home . Because infrared is n't affected by draughts ( it heats people and objects rather than air ) , its easier to keep a constant temperature . The thermal mass created by heat radiation means the walls and floors will continue to give off heat even after the heating panels themselves have been switched off . <h> Infrared heating is better for the planet . <p> Because infrared heating is super efficient and cuts down your energy use , you can be sure you 're opting for an eco-friendly heating source . Less energy used means lower demand for generation , and fewer fossil fuels burned in the process . With carbon emissions directly linked to global warming and health problems , loads of us would like to cut down our environmental impact when we can .

@@36749069 @5749069/ <h> DIY Floor Insulation <h> Insulation <h> Installing floor insulation yourself <p> Not all home insulation work has to be carried out by a professional . It is fairly simple to do if you are a DIY enthusiast , and all the materials are available from your local DIY store . A roll of the fibre ( 7m long x 1m wide ) will cost about -15 , and the insulating boards for concrete floors are approximately -20 ( 2.4m x 1.2m ) . Obviously the wool fibres and insulating boards come in different thicknesses and therefore provide different levels of insulation , so please speak to your local DIY store representative for more detail . Filling in the gaps between the skirting board and the floor with a silicone sealant costs about -20 . <p> Professional installation of floor insulation is obviously more expensive , so it is worth checking with a variety of local firms to get quotes . <p> If you do decide to carry out the insulation work yourself , be sure to take appropriate safety precautions such as wearing protective clothing , as some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare skin . <p> Also it is not necessary to insulate floors on the second or third floor if the rooms below are heated . If the room resides over a basement or a garage for instance you can use a similar process to the wooden floor guide above , by simply stapling the wool between the joists ( if you can access them ) . <h> Insulating a suspended timber floor <p> A suspended timber floor , whereby the floorboards sit upon wooden joists , can be insulated in one of two ways : <h> 1 . Access the floorboards from underneath <p> If you can easily access the underneath of the floorboards ( potentially- if you have a cellar ) , then you can simply insert rigid insulating board between the joists and use battens to hold them in place ( if required ) . Using a saw you need to cut the insulating board to the exact width of the joists ; if you have done this correctly then you can use a wooden mallet to gently tap the insulation into place and it should stay where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If when you have cut the insulation , the width of it is much smaller than the width of the joists , then obviously it will simply drop out of the joists , so in this instance you will need to hold them in place . The easiest way to do this is to push the insulation in place and hold it there using battens that you will need to attach to the insides of the joists as shown in the diagram . <h> 2 . No access to the underneath of the suspended floor <p> Unfortunately if there is no access to the underneath of the suspended floor then the job is made more difficult because the floorboards need to be removed prior to insulating . In this situation , wool insulation is used as opposed to the rigid insulating boards . <p> The first step is to lift the floorboards up , to expose the joists . This will probably mean moving furniture off the floor , and if the floorboards are irregular sizes , it is worth marking where they go either drawing a map or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as before ! <p> Once you have exposed the joists , you may notice that one or two are rotting so these can be replaced if- appropriate . Next , a- net needs to be spread over the whole of the floor space ensuring that it sags substantially between each of the joists . This sagging net acts as a hammock in which the insulation sits . <p> The next step is to lay the insulating wool between the joists , normally by running it parallel to the joists . It is worth trying to purchase wool with a- width- similar- to the joists , although all insulating wool can be cut to size very easily to ensure a nice snug fit . As is the case for loft insulation , the thicker the wool , the better the insulation will be , however you definitely do not want the insulation touching the ground beneath the suspended timber floor , so make sure the net does not sag to that extent . Installing floor insulation should also act as a draught excluder , stopping cold draughts enter the home through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite being more expensive ) , because it is more breathable than manmade insulating wool and it is also a 100% natural material that can be handled without protective clothing . <p> Once the insulation is in place between the joists , the floorboards need to be relaid over the joists to complete the job . <h> Insulating solid floors <p> Many homes are built with solid floors , most of which are made from concrete . These can either be insulated as and when they need replacing , or they can be specially- targeted- for retrofit insulation . You will , however , lose a few inches from the height of the room , as the floor will now sit slightly higher . <p> Insulating concrete floors can not be done with the wool used for wooden floors , as this is soft and would compress as people walked across it . Instead , sheets of polystyrene insulating board are used ( such as Celotex 50/100 mm insulating board ) . Polystyrene is easy to cut and drill holes in , but has high compression resistance ; it also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof membrane over the entirety of the solid floor . Next , lay- the polystyrene insulating boards together across the whole floor so there are no gaps , and join them together using glue or insulating tape .

@@36749070 @5749070/ <h> Evacuated Tube Solar Thermal Hot Water Systems <p> While Solar PV system turn the sun 's energy directly into electricity , solar thermal panels harness the sun 's energy by turning the solar radiation into heat . This heat is normally then used to heat water for use in the home . <p> At the heart of every solar thermal system is the collector and broadly speaking there are three types of collector to choose from flat panelled collectors , plastic collectors and evacuated tube solar collectors . <p> The evacuated tube solar collectors are the most expensive , but importantly they are also the most efficient with a conversion efficiency of over 90% . This means that they can produce more heat , so while a simple plastic collector might be fine to help keep a swimming pool warm " if you want to produce hot water to use in your radiators then ideally you are going to need to go with one of these . <h> The glass / glass evacuated tube solar collector <p> The evacuated tube comprises of a smaller glass tube suspended within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the space between the small inner tube and the larger outer tube creating a vacuum thermal insulation- layer . This vacuum layer is absolutely key since it reduces heat loss from the solar collector . <p> The inside of the inner glass tube is coated with a selective light absorber such as aluminium nitrate or titanium nitride oxide , which helps maximise the absorption of solar radiation over a large range of wavelengths . <p> An absorber plate ( normally made from copper ) then runs the length of the inner glass tube , which absorbs the heat and transfers it to a heat transfer fluid . In passive systems , convection drives the movement of the heating fluid around the solar collector , when the transfer liquid gets heated it evaporates and turns to steam . This rises to the top of the evacuated tube solar collector the heat is transferred via a heat exchanger to another liquid " typically the potable water that is then stored in the hot water storage tank . The transfer liquid , having given up its heat to the heat exchanger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process can start again . <h> - The Cost and Potential Returns for an evacuated Tube solar system <p> A typical evacuated tube solar collector system will cost about -3,000 -5,000 to get installed on your property , and will typically produce about 1,000 " 2,500 kWh of useful heat " or about 50% of your hot water requirements . <p> As long as you get it installed by a MCS approved installer you will then be entitled to the renewable heat premium payment grant which for solar thermal installations is about -600 . In addition , in March 2013 the Renewable heat incentive is launching which will pay you 17.3p / kWh of heat produced . <p> Therefore you should be looking at an annual return of between -170 and -430 depending on the exact output you evacuated tube solar collector and payment is guaranteed for 7 years , but obviously the key thing is that you are producing free hot water for use in your home . <p> It is worth remembering that temperature of the water produced by your system is dependant on the weather " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and also the season , with the majority of the hot water produced during the summer months . <p> As a result we would not suggest solely relying on a evacuated tube solar collector for all your hot water . Instead it should work in conjunction with your existing hot water system ( normally gas boiler or immersion heater ) . In addition it is recommended that water is heated to 650C to ensure that the temperature of the water is sufficient to kill Legionella bacteria ( that cause Legionnaires disease ) , therefore if your solar thermal system only heated it up to 600C for example , then the boiler can just provide the top-up ' . <p> Finally , if you have a combi boiler installed in your home " to take advantage of the hot water you produce you will need to install a hot water storage tank . <h> 4 comments <p> Where does this recommendation for the " water is heated to 65 degC " come from ?

You can walk down almost any street in the country with older properties and you will see it. - It is everywhere . <p> Unfortunately times have moved on , fashions have changed , and pebbledash is almost universally hated by everyone these days . But render lasts a very long time . Pebbledash lasts even longer . It is an incredibly strong , resilient system that will last many decades in most cases , as evidenced by how much of it remains on our walls to this day . <h> Are there any benefits of pebbledash ? <p> One benefit is that you do n't need to paint pebbledash regularly like you do with a standard render . Great news because paint inevitably peels over time and deteriorates . Pebbledash just keeps on going . It is often used in exposed areas as it is extremely hard wearing . <h> How do you- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to crack or lift off the wall ?

But what does that involve ? <p> Unfortunately you can not render over the top of the pebbledash , or any render for that matter . The only solution is to strip all that render off the wall to create a good smooth surface ready for the new render layer to be added . This is a really slow laborious job that takes a lot of blood , sweat and tears for a labourer , and you wo n't get many people queuing up to do this . The very reason that makes pebbledash stay on the wall decade after decade also makes it really difficult to remove . <p> Do n't be surprised if you see costs to re-render at -80-100 per square meter . Most of that cost is in the stripping ! <h> What other options are there ? <p> The alternative would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is that you do n't need to strip it- in most cases- just fix the insulation over the top . <p> Insulation carries a reduced VAT levy of only 5% , whereas render work will have a VAT rate of 20% , so by combining this saving with the saving from not stripping the insulation , you get a very competitive price that means insulating actually makes more sense than just rendering that is without even considering the saving you will get from the insulation and the added comfort of living in a warm , comfortable home . <h> Can I get new pebbledash ? <p> Some people may live in a street where everyone is pebbledashed , which means you would look a bit out of place with a smooth rendered finish . Or , - you may actually like pebbledash ( a bit like a person who gets an avocado bathroom in 2016 ! ) .

@@36749072 @5749072/ <h> Keeping Solar Panels Clean <h> Why Do you need to clean your Solar Panels ? <p> The operating efficiency of a solar PV panel is dependant on the amount on sunlight that hits it . If trees constantly shade your panels , the amount of electricity they generate will be significantly reduced . Likewise , if you panels are covered in dirt they are going to produce less electricity , so keeping them clean ensures you are maximising your generating potential and maximising your returns from the Feed-in Tariff . <p> All sorts of things can make your solar panels dirty pollen from plants and trees , salt deposits ( if you live near the sea ) , may be just an unfortunate bombing run from a bird . In simply may even be just be an accumulation of dust on the panel , but any of these could significantly decrease the amount of electricity you are producing , so how do you go about cleaning the panels to keep them producing the most electricity they can . <h> How to keep you Solar PV panels clean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain does a pretty good job of cleaning them , however it is still a good idea to give them a proper clean 3-4 times a year . <p> When considering cleaning your solar PV panels , never use an abrasive soap or cleaning sponge as this can scratch the glass of the panel , which will permanently lower its generating capacity . Research has even shown using tap water can leave miniscule mineral deposits on the panels when it dries off ( although we do n't suggest spending additional money on purified water ) decreasing capacity . <p> Below we have described the 4 different ways to keep your solar panels clean . <p> Use a soft bristled brush and a liquid soap that you would use to clean the dishes . The soft brush will ensure no damage is done to to the panels while cleaning them . <p> Use a solar panel cleaning company . This is certainly the easiest method , but perhaps the costliest . Simply search on the internet for a local window cleaner who offers the service to professionally clean your panels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get your panels back up to 100% . <p> HeliotexTM offer an automatic solar panel cleaning system that automatically washes and rinses your solar panels . This system attaches water nozzles to your solar panels , and houses a 20litre store of soap concentrate , which is administered to the panels when required . The HeliotexTM system tends to be for large solar installations to make it cost effective . <p> You can also buy a nano-coating that can be applied to the panels , much like polishing a car . You simply treat your solar PV panels with the nano-coating that has hydrophobic properties , which repels water and dirt as it comes into contact with the panels . Nanoshell and Smart shield both supply this material in the UK. <h> 4 comments <p> For both residential and commercial solar installations , knowing when to clean solar panels is a very difficult decision to make .

@@36749077 @5749077/ <h> Introduction to rainwater harvesting <p> Rainwater harvesting- ( sometimes referred to as RWH ) describes the process of collecting rain that falls onto a catchment area . In most cases , the catchment area is the roof of your house , where the rain falls and is then bought to a central point via guttering and down-pipes , before entering a storage tank . In more straight forward water harvesting systems , this storage tank can simply be a water butt , where the water can be tapped off and used in the garden . There are more- complex water harvesting systems that are discussed later , which filter the water , even potentially getting to a suitable level for drinking . However- on the whole , water harvesting is much simpler than recycling- grey water- or- treating domestic sewage . <h> Uses for harvested rainwater <p> If your major catchment area is your roof , then we recommend- putting in a very simple water butt at the bottom of a drain pipe- so it catches rainwater that- can be used in times of- drought , to water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , it will likely pick up pollutants , potentially from the air ( e.g.- exhaust fumes ) , but also things like bird faeces on your roof , therefore water from this source is not drinkable unless it undergoes further treatment . <p> Using a simple sand filter system , you can remove the vast majority of pollutants and larger contaminants , so this water will then be okay to use to flush toilets . In order to do this you will need to use a specialised sealed water container and a submersible pump to get the water to where you need it . This will increase the cost of your water harvesting system . <p> If suitable treatment is in place you can make the rainwater suitable for drinking too . Filters can be used , e.g. a particulate filter that remove particles that are larger than 5 microns in diameter , which can be used in conjunction with ultraviolet light sterilisers , which also kill any dangerous microorganisms in the water to make the water drinkable . Due to the filtration technology needed to support this system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive system , but it will certainly reduce your reliance on the water companies once installed and over time will naturally lower your water- bills ( after the initial capital expenditure ) . <p> It is also important to note that there are other catchment areas to fulfil your rainwater harvesting needs , such as roads or parks . These have the advantage of a massive catchment area , so work better when there is little rainfall , but at the same time the water runoff from these catchment areas is more contaminated with things like oil from cars- and other waste , so it takes more filtration to get the water into a suitable fashion for use in your home . <h> Types of rainwater harvesting system <p> A simple water butt can be bought from most good DIY stores ( e.g.- Homebase- or- B&amp;Q ) , and they start from about -30--40 .

In addition , if you let it fill over the winter , you can use it in the spring to provide water for your garden ; but note that if the water has been stagnant for quite some time , it is highly probable that algae and other microbes may have made into their home ! <p> If you are looking for a slightly grander water harvesting system , with water to be used inside the house ( not just for gardening and washing the car ) , but for completing everyday tasks such as flushing the toilet , it is worth sizing the storage tank by looking at several factors . <p> Obviously the local average rainfall is the major factor , the more rain that falls the more rainwater you can collect . The size of the roof will obviously play a large part in this , as this essentially defines your catchment area . It does n't matter if you live in the vicinity of Victoria Falls , if you only have a small roof , it is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The final thing to think about is the actual volume of water you require , ideally you do n't want the water to sit in the tank for extended periods of time as algae and other microbes will start growing .

A tank size calculator can be found- here , though you will need to know the approximate dimension of your house to use this tool . <h> Water harvesting building regulations <p> These systems are best installed as a new build project or when undergoing major regenerations to a house . In the UK all new were- rated under the- Code for Sustainable Homes- ( CLG 2008 ) , but this was replaced by a- voluntary quality management scheme in 2015 , which is the- Home Quality Mark- ( HQM ) . - Although not mandatory , there are standards in the HQM , which talk about the best practices to- reduce potable water consumption including harvesting- rainwater as one of the- ways to meet this .

@@36749080 @5749080/ <h> Room Thermostats <h> Heating <h> What is a thermostat ? <p> The thermostat is now a common fixture in most homes , helping to maintain an even temperature in the house all year round . In the winter , room thermostats ( sometimes referred to as roomstats ) prevent rooms from overheating . In the summer months , they ensure the heating system does not fire up unless the temperature of the house falls to a preset low level . <h> How do thermostats work ? <p> A thermostat is normally a control unit for a central heating boiler . You choose the temperature that you would like the house to be at via a dial or a digital display on the thermostat . The thermostat then monitors the ambient temperature of the air and instructs the boiler to turn on or off accordingly . <p> If the temperature of the ambient air is lower than the requested temperature set on the thermostat , it will fire a message to the boiler to fire up and send hot water to the radiators to heat the house . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will send a message to the boiler to switch off , which obviously should result in the home cooling down . <p> Using a thermostat will therefore ensure that the house stays at a regular temperature and rooms do n't overheat ( via a conventional heating system " they may still over heat in the summer due to solar gain ! ) . The thermostat will ensure that the boiler keeps a constant temperature in the house , which results in an efficient heating system that will save you money on your gas bills . <h> How much can a room Thermostat Save ? <p> A correctly installed thermostat can save you -100s per year , however you have to know how to get the best out of it . For example , a preinstalled room thermostat can save about -65 for every degree centigrade you turn it down . Therefore if you have your home at 230C normally and then decide to turn the thermostat down to 210C , you should see energy savings of well over -100 . <p> We have written a blog you can read here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discusses some of the common queries people have when it comes to setting their thermostat . <h> Thermostats do not speed up the rate of heating <p> One common misconception of thermostats is that if you turn up the dial of the thermostat , the room will heat up quicker . The rate at which a room heats up is dependant on the boiler , the size of the room , the size of the radiator and finally how well insulated the room is . <h> Thermostats and draughts <p> Roomstats are sensitive little things ; if they are hit by prolonged cold draughts they will instruct the boiler to fire up . This means that they have to be positioned very carefully in the house . <p> For example , we have seen thermostats installed in clients hallways just by the draughty front door . This means that they will normally be recording a lower temperature than the actual ambient temperature of the house and will instruct the boiler to fire up , using more gas . <h> Thermostats are just part of heating controls <p> Thermostats are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally include a- programmer- and- TRVs . They are designed to work seamlessly with the other components , with the thermostat overriding the programmer to prevent overheating .

They allow you to set the temperature of the home from the other side of the world via your phone , but they also take into account things like direct sunlight , which in the past has manipulated the ambient air temperature . 184565 @qwx384565 <p> Hello.Thats really interesting .

@@36749081 @5749081/ <h> Energy Efficiency for Flats <h> December 21 , 2015 <p> So many articles you read online are based around insulating a house . As you may have read in one of our articles a few weeks back " the average home in the UK is a 3 bed semi . This means that companies will tend to aim their products and marketing material at houses rather than flats and apartments . However , modern housing developments are seeing lots more flats being built due to the shortage of space and the cost of land . Many older properties are being split up into smaller flats for maximising rent and resale value . <h> Insulation for Flats <p> Most flats are surrounded by other properties which help to keep them warm . Further , flats tend to have been built after the 2nd World War , which means they have cavity walls making them much warmer than an older property . <p> Having said that , it is always worth looking at insulation for your property . Cavity wall insulation might be tricky , because everyone in the block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't just insulate one floor . The alternative is to insulate internally , which will lose you a bit of space in the flat , but can be done on an individual wall and wo n't need to involve the neighbours . External insulation is a possible approach for solid walls , but again you would need the whole block to be done , and the works would be extensive and expensive . <h> How to Heat your Flat <p> Flats present some challenges in terms of heating . Space is always an issue , so a compact heating system is crucial . Electrical heating can be convenient , but it is often expensive compared to gas . Of course , many flats do not have a gas supply , especially high rises , so you have limited choice . This means there is usually a trade off somewhere along the line . The most popular heating methods are usually one of the following : <p> Combi Boiler " For a flat that has a gas supply , a combi boiler is a good choice . Gas heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extra space that is taken up by a system boiler . <p> Community Heating " In larger blocks , a community boiler is often installed . These are usually fairly cheap to run and only need radiators in the property , but the controls then become really important , and you may end up paying a service charge even if you do n't use the heating much . <p> Electric Storage Heaters " These take advantage of cheaper night tariffs , but you will need a separate water heater because storage heaters are a dry system , so you are n't really saving much space . <p> Infrared " A relatively new form of heating , the advantage here is that the heaters are much slimmer and sleeker than storage heaters and still efficient when compared to electric heaters . Hot water again requires a cylinder of separate instantaneous heater . <p> Hot water will either require an instant hot water heater , like an electric water heater or a combi boiler , or you will need a cylinder with an immersion heater that heats water in situ . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extent . <h> Renewables for Flats <p> Everyone wants to get involved in renewable technology it seems , and it you have some garden and a roof of your own , it is really easy . When you just have a flat with another flat below and perhaps one above , or a shared roof , it is really much more restricted . <p> There are some things that you can do at a flat however . Solar might be out of the question , but a heat pump could work really well If you can mount it on an external wall . Flats tend to be better insulated because of the properties around them , and heat pumps work well in well insulated properties . <h> 2 comments <p> The Sedbuk is a database of boilers detailing their seasonal efficiency ( this is what people refer to when they say their boiler is 90% efficient etc ) . Are you looking for a CHP boiler for your individual flat or to heat and provide electricity for a number of flats ? 
@@36749082 @5749082/ <h> Commercial EPC <h> What is a commercial EPC ? <p> Commercial Energy Performance Certificates ( EPC ) are energy surveys that determine how energy efficient a building or commercial premises is . The ratings on a commercial EPC start from G ( least energy efficient ) , going up to an A for the most energy efficient building possible . <p> The history of London is long and varied and as a result there is quite a diverse stock of commercial premises across the city . Take for example the retail and service providers in central parts of London , these are housed in Georgian and Victorian properties " which whilst fantastic to look at , are not very energy efficient . <p> Conversely , newer premises such as the Shard , Wembley Stadium and the Olympic Park were all built very recently so all comply with the most stringent energy efficiency and management standards . - There are obviously millions of properties across London and one of the things that makes our job so interesting is that they all vary so much in terms of their energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency of building fabric and the installed heating , ventilation , cooling and lighting systems ( building services ) , it does not take into account how the present occupier uses these systems . This is planned with the roll-out of the commercial Green Deal ( yet to be announced ) . <h> Why were commercial EPCs introduced ? <p> EPCs were introduced by the European Union initiative ( Directive 2002/91/EC EPBD ) to help drive energy efficiency across all the member states . <p> As energy consumption is increasing , so are CO2 emissions that go hand in hand with it . Therefore this directive was designed to address two high level challenges : <p> Reduce harmful CO2 emissions that are a by-product of non-renewable energy production ; <p> Ensure energy supplies are secured and maintained in the medium and long-term . <p> At a national level ( the UK ) , this directive ensures that member states implement some of these key principles : <p> Develop consistent methods for assessing the energy performance in buildings and some of the installed building services , e.g. heating , ventilation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and work on improvement on large buildings <p> Provide certificates of buildings that state its performance and in some circumstances have those certificates for public display <p> Suggest improvements for efficiency on heating , ventilation and cooling systems <p> Raise the awareness of the occupiers and other energy users about the energy efficiency of their properties <h> When would I need a commercial EPC ? <p> In London , as in all parts of the UK , if you are looking to rent or sell the commercial premises or the building has just been constructed then a commercial EPC will need to be undertaken " this is a legal requirement . This is to provide the economic agent ' - ( the prospective buyer or tenant ) with the most updated information on the propertys energy efficiency . <p> Commercial EPCs are valid for 10 years from the time when they are produced . Any new EPC produced after the original simply replaces it . A property can only have one valid commercial EPC at any one moment. - Please note if the building goes through a significant update @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , significant extension additions to the property and/or changes to the provision of fixed services then a new EPC will have to be produced . Also if there are modifications to the existing premises after the original transaction date then a new EPC should be produced . <h> Can you get away with not having a commercial EPC ? <p> It is the responsibility of local building control officers , new build inspectors and planning at a local authority level to perform regular checks for EPCs when the property exchanges hands or when it has been built . In addition if the building is serviced by air-conditioning units ( above 12kWs ) , they have to have inspection certificates in place " and reviewed every 5 years . <p> Enforcement agencies have the power to investigate and request a copy of the EPC , the accompanying recommendations report and any applicable air-conditioning report . The responsible person has 7 days to produce this documentation upon request . <p> The penalty for failing to produce a valid commercial EPC to any prospective buyer or tenant when selling or letting non-dwellings is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rateable value of the building . There is a minimum fine of -500 though and a maximum penalty of -5,000 and you still need to produce the report after this ! Where the above formula ca n't be applied , there is a default -750 fine . <h> When is a commercial EPC not required ? <p> A commercial EPC is not a statutory requirement if the building is a non-public existing building and is not exchanging ownership or occupancy . <p> Temporary constructed buildings , which have a lifespan of less than 2 years <p> Industrial and agricultural sites that have a low heating demand " for example a barn with no HVAC system would be exempt <p> Standalone buildings , which have a floor area less than 50m2 <p> Protected buildings that have a designated environmental or historical merit <h> Potential benefits of a commercial EPC <p> Like the domestic dwellings market , commercial buildings are also being assessed in far greater numbers , which is increasing transparency and making comparability a lot easier from building to building . <p> Energy prices have seen a significant increase over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen a doubling of the cash price paid for energy over the same period . This makes the running costs of a building quite high on the agenda of the people that actually occupy it " in most cases they are looking to minimise them ! <p> A commercial premises has a much greater thirst for energy during the working day " not only powering the heating system , but also powering mechanical ventilation and cooling . The key is to have an energy efficient building that is n't expensive to run , because if you are based in London where business rates and rent is high , this can push you over the edge . <p> Level 4 building " standard building with air-conditioning , e.g. new office blocks with climate control , any other building with air-conditioning <p> Level 5 building " building with a complex structure that requires special software to model , e.g. Westfield West London , Wembley Stadium ( as seen above ) and City Hall have atria and therefore need complex modelling to determine the energy rating <p> The commercial EPC produces an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fabric and the installed business services . This can be compared to the target emission rate ( TER ) , which is the rate if the building was constructed to today 's buildings regulations . <p> The higher the BER relative to the TER , the higher the CO2 emissions and the lower the EPC rating " remember A is the best rating whilst G Is the worst . <p> Note that the EPC does n't take into account how energy is used " so even though the energy rating of a building is poor , the energy bills may be very low , because the owners do n't heat and light it very much . <h> The Commercial EPC Process <p> To kick off the EPC process , a qualified assessor will need to visit the property and carry out a physical inspection of all the key components ( building fabric , lighting , business services ) , taking into account any changes that have happened to the building over time . During the visit the assessor will determine the activities ' for various parts of the property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into zones . All the measurements from the zones are separately recorded in the software and when added up at the end should equal to the total size of the building . <p> Sometimes the information about the building adaptations may not be obvious from the inspection and additional information will be sought from the person commissioning the EPC . <p> If the information is not provided and can not be evidenced , then the assessor is obliged to revert to default ' values , which will suppress the rating . However if supplementary and adequate information is provided , then the assessor will be able to override those values and help produce an EPC with a better score . <h> Who can undertake a commercial EPC ? <p> For Level 3 and Level 4 buildings , the Simplified Building Energy Model ( SBEM ) is used and to be honest this will capture most commercial properties out there . - The Dynamic Simulation Model ( DSM ) , can be applied to calculate Level 5 buildings . Assessors need to have to have the right level of qualification to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example a Level 4 assessor will be able to produce reports for Level 3 and Level 4 buildings but not a Level 5 building . <p> For new buildings being commissioned in the design stage , only a Level 4/5 assessor will be able to help with this request . <p> When all the data is entered into the software , it should produce the EPC certificate and a separate Recommendations Report . They are both then lodged onto register ( managed by Landmark in England &amp; Wales ) . <p> The recommendation report that is produced shows ways the buildings energy efficiency could be improved . The fabric and the construction of the building has the biggest impact on the rating , followed by the building services and renewables . When the EPC is produced , it will kick out a raft of different recommendations for improvement , sub-divided into short-term , medium-term and long-term payback measures . <p> It is up to the assessor producing the report to use his/her best judgement , taking into account the building , business activities and long-term aspirations , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this process can produce genuine value added insight on energy efficiency to the intended users of that particular building . <p> As mentioned London has many old commercial buildings , all diverse and very much spread out across a vast geographical area . It therefore goes without saying that the recommendation reports should flag up a whole number of energy efficiency improvements that can be implemented . <h> Commercial EPC Authenticity <p> When the Commercial EPC is correctly lodged , it will produce a RRN number , which is located on the top right hand side of the certificate . The certificate can be searched for independently by any prospective buyer or occupier on the non-domestic registry website ( www.ndepcregister.com ) as long as they have this RRN number . <p> If assessors send across an EPC without this information then the certificate is not lodged and you will be liable if the matter is investigated by building control . <h> Interested in a Commercial- EPC ? <p> If you are interested in booking a EPC for your business or commercial premises , fill out the- form below with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch to discuss your requirements. - Prices start at -99+VAT , but will vary on the size of the property and the number of zones in the building . 184565 @qwx384565 <p> We got Alan to come around and produce a commercial EPC for our premises near Farringdon .

To make cement , limestone ( calcium carbonate " CaCO3 ) is heated to temperatures approaching 10000C , along with other feedstock materials such as clay ( which contains silicates ) . At this temperature , the limestone ( and other feedstock ) breaks down into Calcium Oxide ( known as Lime CaO ) , Silicon Oxides and Carbon dioxide . The two oxides then combine to produce di &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powder producing a product known as clinker ' . <p> Finally Gypsum is added to the clinker ( to prevent flash setting of the cement ) , and this is ground to produce the cement , which can then be used as the main ingredient to make concrete . <p> There are two ways that making cement releases CO2 : <p> Burning fossil fuels to heat the kilns to achieve the reaction temperatures <p> Breaking down calcium carbonate into calcium oxide and CO2 <p> The burning of the fossil fuels accounts for about- 30% of the total CO2 , while breaking down the calcium carbonate accounts for 70% <h> Processes to Make Cement Manufacture Greener ' <p> So how can you make greener ' cement , thereby helping to reduce the total volume of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere ? <h> Carbon Sequestration <p> Well strictly , the first couple of processes I touch upon are not related to changing the manufacturing process , but instead installing carbon sequestration techniques , thereby using the CO2 rich flue gasses to produce new materials . <p> As covered across TheGreenAge , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products . Artificial photosynthesis would use this gas to produce sugars that are essentially a store of energy , replicating the natural process that plants use for growth everyday . The benefit of this technique would be not only limiting CO2 emissions , but also producing a valuable by-product . <p> Bio-algal synthesis is another technique for using the CO2 ; in this process the gas is pumped through a waste water growth medium infused with microalgae . These algae use sunlight and the CO2 for growth , doubling their mass every 24 hours , which can eventually be crushed for algae oil and algae meal for cattle . The advantage of the algae meal is that there is little cellulose within it ( unlike regular crop derived meal ) , so when digested by cattle , very little methane is produced ( another greenhouse gas ) , helping to solve another greenhouse gas emitting problem . <p> In terms of changes to the process itself , there are numerous different ways that it could be carried out to produce lower carbon dioxide emissions . <h> Using Electrolysis to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , replacing the initial kiln part of the reaction , different resulting molecules would be produced . <p> If carried out over 8000C , electrolysis would produce lime in addition to carbon and an oxygen molecule . If it is carried out under 8000C , the Lime is produced along with carbon monoxide and an oxygen atom . Carbon monoxide can be used to produce fuel and form plastics , and has a value of approximately $600 / tonne , allowing one to actually make money from the process ( based on the lower cost to produce the lime ) . <h> Make Extra Strong Concrete , Need to Use Less ! <p> This is a fairly simple idea , but by changing the feedstock entering the initial furnace , you can change the chemical composition of the clinker. - So why not make extra strong ' concrete , so you do n't need to use as much to perform the same job . Placticisers are additives that are added to the concrete that increase its strength . They are relatively complex but essentially to get strong concrete you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These placticisers act as spacers between the cement molecules , ensuring that there is less water in contact with these molecules , hence stronger concrete . <h> Use Solar Power <p> The kilns used in the current process ( to heat the clay and limestone ) need to reach incredibly high temperatures . Historically , these temperatures have been reached by using the heat from burning fossil fuels ( accounting for 30% of the carbon dioxide emissions from the cement manufacturing process ) . If the kilns were instead heated using a green electricity source , for example a concentrated solar power plant , this would obviously instantly remove much of the CO2 produced in the process . <h> Use Consistent mixes to make the concrete <p> Currently under EU standards there are 170 different types of concrete mix used in the construction industry . This poses a problem for builders , who simply do not know the strength of the different types , so in order to make sure ' the construction is strong enough , excess concrete is used. - If there were only say 10 types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the characteristics of each one , and they would be able to predict accurately how much of that particular type to use , thereby using less in the overall construction process . <h> Actually redefining the Ingredients That Make Up Concrete <p> There are numerous companies at the moment looking at creating a new concrete altogether . Instead of relying on limestone for the source of lime , research startups are trying to harness other techniques . <p> Novacem , a startup based in Imperial College , is looking to replace limestone with Magnesium based Silicates , current prototypes are beginning to demonstrate strength on par with traditional concrete . <p> Calera , based in California and backed by Vinod Khosla , is looking to use the flue gases of other high CO2 emitting industries to make the cement . <p> Louisiana Tech is looking to do away with limestone too , by creating a paste from fly ash ( bits of non combustible fuel thrown out of the flue with exhaust gases ) , sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide . <p> As a $170bn industry , it is clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have started popping up have decided to spend the time and financial resources to try to come up with a greener concrete , that could one day replace the traditional concrete . <h> The Future of Concrete <p> China currently use about half of the world 's supply of cement , and this demand is expected to rise by an additional 700,000 tonnes over the next 5 years . If current production techniques are used , an equivalent 700,000 tonnes of CO2 will enter the atmosphere . <p> This is just China though ; hopefully in the next couple of years the worlds economies will be able to put the current financial situation behind them , and begin a new phase of growth . As a result , global demand for concrete is only going to rise , therefore we really need to come up with a way to lessen the impact of the concrete industry on the environment , potentially using one of the methods detailed above . <h> The Green Deal Frequently Asked Questions <h> Do you need an assessment to get Green Deal Finance &amp; Cashback <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Cashback you will need a Green Deal Report produced by a certified Green Deal Assessor . <h> Can I take my Green Deal report to any provider ? <p> Yes " the Green Deal Report is portable , so regardless of who carries out the assessment , you can get quotes from any Green Deal Provider . <h> Can I use my current builder to install the work ? <p> Yes " provided the builder is a Green Deal Approved installer ( PAS2030 certified ) . If they are n't , you can still use them , but you wo n't be able to access the Green Deal finance or Green Deal cashback . <h> Can a landlord benefit from the Green Deal ? <p> Recent changes to the Green Deal Legislation means that landlords can now get Green Deal finance , so they can get measures installed in their properties and the bill payer will make the Green Deal finance payments on the measures ( which is obviously advantageous in the case of tenants paying their utility bills ) . <h> Do I have to pay interest on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Green Deal finance is set at 6.96% . On the face of it , this is quite a high interest rate , however the loan is fixed " taking into account solid wall insulation is paid back over 25 years , they have had to opt for a rate that is high enough to cover any future interest price rises by the bank of England . <h> What is ECO ? <p> ECO or the Energy Company Obligation is the grant part of the Green Deal scheme . You can find out more about ECO here " but in some cases you can use this Grant in conjunction with Green Deal finance to ensure that there is no upfront payment . <h> What types of charges are associated with Green Deal finance ? <p> Aside from the 6.96% interest rate , there is a Green Deal Finance Company charge and an Energy Company charge that go towards cover the compliance and administration costs to set up and administer the Green Deal Plan . <h> Aside from Green Deal finance and cash back " why would I get a Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers are simply getting the Green Deal Advice Report ( GDAR ) since they are not sure where to start on their own properties in terms of improving the energy efficiency of their homes . <p> When the assessor visits your home ( provided they are good ! ) , they will provide you with numerous tips and tricks on how to lower your bills , as well as letting you know what other schemes feed into the Green Deal , like the Renewable Heat incentive and the Feed-in Tariff <p> The Green Deal is now also a legal requirement to be able to get the Renewable Heat Incentive ( RHI ) excluding self-build properties . <h> Is the Green Deal a Grant ? <p> The Green Deal is not a grant " you borrow money against the energy savings that the measure installed creates . For example , replacing an old boiler with a new energy efficient model will allow you to heat the home using less gas " which will produce a saving on your gas bill . <h> How long is my Green Deal Report Valid For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ( *source Energy Saving Advice Service helpline 0300 123 1234 ) provided the property does n't undergo major changes during that time that would impact its energy efficiency . <h> Can I use my existing EPC to get a Green Deal Report ? <p> If there has been an EPC carried out on your property after April 2012 , then the assessor may choose to use the information provided . However , in our experience very few assessors will be happy to accept existing EPCs since the accuracy of them tends to be rather variable depending on the quality of the assessor ! <p> If , since getting the EPC , major works have taken place to the property that will have significantly altered its energy efficiency , you will need to get a new EPC completed regardless . <h> What Will my Green Deal Report Look like ? <p> The Green Deal Report is a 5-page document " you can click here to see an example of what the report looks like , and you can click here to learn exactly what each of the different sections on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about claiming Green Deal Cashback ? <p> A full , step-by-step guide to applying for cashback can be found here- - <h> What if I do n't have 12 months of energy bills <p> If you do not have any information regarding energy bills , or have lived in the property fewer than 12 months then the Green Deal Report will not be able to provide you with accurate savings tailored to you . However , this does not affect the amount of funding you may receive as this is taken from a typical household living in your property . <h> Why is there a fee for the assessment ? <p> The fee is based on the work required to produce the report , including the site survey , travel time and lodgement fees . In some cases councils may fully subsidise the cost of a Green Deal Assessment , or energy companies might try and offer free assessments in return for taking out other services they offer . On the whole though , all independent assessors will charge for the assessment as one might expect for a professional service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we for example charge -110 + VAT for our Green Deal surveys . <h> Can I repay the Green Deal Early ? <p> You can absolutely pay back the Green Deal early if you want to , although in some cases there might be an early repayment charge . <p> Typically if the original length of the Green Deal plan was under 15 years , then the repayment charge is likely to be very small ( under -8,000 left and it will actually be zero ) <p> If you originally took out a Green Deal plan over 15 years , the early repayment charge is a little more difficult to calculate " and involves comparing the fixed interest charge on your individual Green Deal plan ( i.e. at December 2013 " 6.96% ) , with the current interest being charged on Green Deal plans " but even so the repayment charge is capped at a low level . <h> Is the work done under Green Deal guaranteed ? <p> Yes " all work carried out under the Green Deal scheme ( including installations done under the Green Deal ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if the measure goes wrong within 5 years ( or 25 years in the case of cavity walls and solid walls ) , the Green Deal provider will rectify the problem free of charge . If the Green Deal Provider goes bust in that time frame , the liability should be covered by the insurer who has underwritten the policy . <p> In the case of damage to the property resulting from a Green Deal installation , you can get the Green Deal provider to come and sort the issue within 10 years of the original measure being installed . <h> Can I still switch my energy provider ? <p> There are various different energy companies signed up to the Green Deal including the Big six " British Gas , EDF , E.On , nPower &amp; SSE . In addition , there are some small suppliers also signed up including Flow , Green Energy and Opus . <p> Provided you are swapping between these energy suppliers then there is absolutely no problem since the Green Deal finance amount is set . If you have a Green Deal plan in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplier offering Green Deal finance to another provider who does n't offer the finance . <h> What if you ca n't afford the Green Deal finance charge anymore ? <p> Much like when you default on energy bills , if you suddenly find yourself in a position where you ca n't pay the Green Deal portion of the bill you would eventually be disconnected . <p> There are obviously a few steps they will take before they disconnect you for instance they may agree to defer payments or connect you up to a prepayment meter " in addition in some cases they will not disconnect the home during the winter . <h> What happens if I move house ? <p> The Green Deal is tied to your electricity meter ( i.e. your home ) , not to you , so if you sell your property , the debt will pass on to the next assessor . <p> If you do decide to sell or let out the property , you will need to disclose the details of the Green Deal payments to the incoming bill payer . <h> Evacuated Tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn the sun 's energy directly into electricity , solar thermal panels harness the sun 's energy by turning the solar radiation into heat . This heat is normally then used to heat water for use in the home . <p> At the heart of every solar thermal system is the collector and broadly speaking there are three types of collector to choose from flat panelled collectors , plastic collectors and evacuated tube solar collectors . <p> The evacuated tube solar collectors are the most expensive , but importantly they are also the most efficient with a conversion efficiency of over 90% . This means that they can produce more heat , so while a simple plastic collector might be fine to help keep a swimming pool warm " if you want to produce hot water to use in your radiators then ideally you are going to need to go with one of these . <h> The glass / glass evacuated tube solar collector <p> The evacuated tube comprises of a smaller glass tube suspended within a larger glass tube . The air is then pumped out of the space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating a vacuum thermal insulation- layer . This vacuum layer is absolutely key since it reduces heat loss from the solar collector . <p> The inside of the inner glass tube is coated with a selective light absorber such as aluminium nitrate or titanium nitride oxide , which helps maximise the absorption of solar radiation over a large range of wavelengths . <p> An absorber plate ( normally made from copper ) then runs the length of the inner glass tube , which absorbs the heat and transfers it to a heat transfer fluid . In passive systems , convection drives the movement of the heating fluid around the solar collector , when the transfer liquid gets heated it evaporates and turns to steam . This rises to the top of the evacuated tube solar collector the heat is transferred via a heat exchanger to another liquid " typically the potable water that is then stored in the hot water storage tank . The transfer liquid , having given up its heat to the heat exchanger then condenses and falls back down the evacuated tube where the process can start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evacuated Tube solar system <p> A typical evacuated tube solar collector system will cost about -3,000 -5,000 to get installed on your property , and will typically produce about 1,000 " 2,500 kWh of useful heat " or about 50% of your hot water requirements . <p> As long as you get it installed by a MCS approved installer you will then be entitled to the renewable heat premium payment grant which for solar thermal installations is about -600 . In addition , in March 2013 the Renewable heat incentive is launching which will pay you 17.3p / kWh of heat produced . <p> Therefore you should be looking at an annual return of between -170 and -430 depending on the exact output you evacuated tube solar collector and payment is guaranteed for 7 years , but obviously the key thing is that you are producing free hot water for use in your home . <p> It is worth remembering that temperature of the water produced by your system is dependant on the weather " you obviously produce more hot water in hot sunny weather " and also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the summer months . <p> As a result we would not suggest solely relying on a evacuated tube solar collector for all your hot water . Instead it should work in conjunction with your existing hot water system ( normally gas boiler or immersion heater ) . In addition it is recommended that water is heated to 650C to ensure that the temperature of the water is sufficient to kill Legionella bacteria ( that cause Legionnaires disease ) , therefore if your solar thermal system only heated it up to 600C for example , then the boiler can just provide the top-up ' . <p> Finally , if you have a combi boiler installed in your home " to take advantage of the hot water you produce you will need to install a hot water storage tank . <h> Light bulb Colours and Brightness <p> The local DIY store has plenty of different shades of white paint , and just as you can paint your walls different types of white , so you can have different types of colour in light bulbs . <h> Colour Temperature <p> Different types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that those over 5,000K are called cool colours ( bluish white ) , while those around 2,700K are considered warm colours ( yellowish white ) . <h> What About LEDs ? <p> So there is a wide variety of colours , with different bulbs emitting different ranges of colours . Some people prefer the warmer colours , others the cooler ones , and of course different rooms and areas of the home might be better suited to certain colours . You can get many of these colours in LED bulbs now . <h> What are Lumens ? <p> You often see lumens quoted on various light bulbs . A lumen is simply a measure of how much light is being emitted that can be detected by the human eye . This is used because power ( i.e. Wattage ) can refer to invisible ranges of the spectrum of light , as well as the visible . So if your light bulb is giving off infra red , you wo n't be able to see it , even though a form of light is being emitted . <h> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to remember is that Wattage and Lumens are very different . Even between the same style of LED bulbs there can be differences in the ratio of Watts to Lumens " this is simply because one bulb is more efficient at turning that power into visible light , with less power being used to create invisible parts of the spectrum . Also remember that LED bulbs last much longer , and dim more slowly over their lifetime compared to older bulb types , so bear this in mind when buying ! <p> To give you an idea of how lumens compare between older light bulbs and LED , we have made a comparison table for you below : <h> Preparing to Apply the Wallrock <p> Firstly , make sure your walls are clean and free of any loose wallpaper or flaking paint . It is recommended that all surfaces are sanded down and sized ' with adhesive before you start . <h> Applying the Wallrock <p> Mark out straight lines on the wall using the plumb line to make sure your Wallrock is applied vertically . <p> Apply Liner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a roller or brush for this . Make sure you apply more over textured or damaged surfaces . It is worth applying enough adhesive to complete one length each time , ensuring the entire surface to be papered is covered with the adhesive . <p> Apply the thermal liner with fluffy side down . You can cut a length each time or hang directly from the roll . <p> Do not overlap the paper , as you add new lengths , ensure they are tight to the length next to it . Remove excess adhesive as required using a sponge and clean water . <p> Let the walls dry for a day naturally . That means no heating systems , except if the room is especially cold . <p> Now you can paint over the top or hang standard wallpaper to cover the Wallrock* . Ensure any small gaps are filled with flexible , non-shrinking filler . <p> *Note that wallpaper used should be paste-to-wall ' or non-woven paper ' . Otherwise thermal expansion may cause buckling or folding of the paper . <h> Installing Underfloor Heating with Suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter some interesting properties on our travels . One property we recently Green Deal assessed , located in North London , was going through a major retrofit , including the installation of an air source heat pump with underfloor heating . <p> Underfloor heating we would say is a nice to have as the ability to walk on a nice warm floor even in the midst of winter is definitely a really pleasurable experience . In addition , provided you have a well-insulated property ; it can be a much more efficient way of heating your property compared to using radiators . This is because the temperature the floor is heated to is much lower than trying to heat with radiators , hence less energy is required ; and since heat rises a more even distribution of heat can be provided . <p> Now , the property in question was a Victorian semi in Primrose Hill , with solid walls and suspended timber floors throughout .

We recommend going for a wet system as this is better suited to heating larger surface areas like your living room and kitchen . <h> Installing the insulation <p> 1 . Prior to thinking about expensive measures like renewables , you first need to insulate the envelope of the house ( loft , walls and floors ) . In this instance it is an absolute must before starting the installing of the underfloor heating system . As mentioned the heating works at lower temperatures than conventional systems so it is imperative the heat they produce does n't escape , which will be the case if you get insulation. - <p> As the photo - shows , the first thing you do is fix some battens to the sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating pipes and screed that will go above that . <p> 2 . Having put this in place you then install polystyrene boards like Celotex or Kingspan of variable thickness .

The next step is to install the heating pipes , which are then fixed to the top of the insulation boards as shown on the photo below .

The process for installing underfloor heating and insulation on a suspended timber floor can be found here . <h> Process of installing underfloor heating on a Solid Floor <p> In the following guide we look at installing a wet underfloor heating system , although you can install electric dry ' systems . <h> Installing the insulation <p> 1 . Prior to laying the anything on the solid floor , you first need to insulate the envelope of the house ( loft , walls and floors ) . This is an absolute must before starting the installing of the underfloor heating system . As mentioned they work at lower temperatures than conventional heating systems so it is imperative the heat the produce does n't escape , so we strongly recommend doing the insulation first , otherwise your new heating solution could essentially not work . <p> The first photos shows a roll of water proof membrane , which is laid out on the concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also prevent damp from rising in the floor . <p> 2 . Having put this in place you can then install polystyrene boards like Celotex or Kingspan of variable thickness . The precise thickness of boards installed can vary from 25mm of insulation to 150mm of insulation . However on concrete floors the more insulation you put in , the more room height you sacrifice , although obviously the less heat will escape into the ground . It is vital that you do n't run the underfloor heating coils directly onto the concrete floor without first laying insulation otherwise the majority of the heat will be lost into the ground . <p> In the photo below I made out the thickness to be 75mm , which was added throughout the ground floor area . <p> 3 .

A range of floor finishes can be applied to the screed layer including tiles , veneer or wooden boards . This entirely depends on your taste and preference . In my property example the home owner went for a carpeted finish , which meant carpet underlay went in before the carpet was rolled out . <h> Underfloor heating with Renewables <p> It is also worth mentioning that underfloor heating works especially well with renewable heating solutions like air source heat pumps or solar thermal since they produce hot water at lower temperatures than traditional gas fired central heating systems .

The first is the generation tariff which pays a set amount for every kWh of electricity produced regardless whether it is used in the building or exported back to the grid . <p> The second part of the Feed-in tariff is known as the export tariff , and this is a payment made for every kWh of electricity exported back to the electricity grid .

Details of these can be found- here . <p> Each tier ' for size of system is a step change , so a wind system of 499kW will create almost twice the tariff income as a 501kW system .

The import meter is simply your current electric meter , measuring the energy you use . The generation meter is fitted as standard to measure what your system is generating . The export meter is an optional additional meter which measures what you export back to the grid . <p> A decided advantage for those companies that use a lot of the energy they generate is that the export tariff , when a meter is n't present , is based on an export rate of 50% of the energy you produce .

For those businesses that feel they are exporting more than 50% , you are entitled to install an export meter , at a cost , which will allow a precise export tariff to be paid to you . For the most part , this will not be advantageous to you as the vast majority will be using more than 50% . <h> For systems over 30kW <p> If you have a larger system , you will have to install an export meter as a matter of cause . - You will be paid for precisely the energy you export to the grid . <h> Accreditation <p> In order to claim the FiT your system will have to be accredited in one of two ways : <p> Installations for PV and Wind installations which have a Declared Net Capacity up to and including- 50kW ( microgenerators ) and micro CHP installations with a Declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MCS accredited installation .

Insulating your walls is a great method of making your home more energy efficient . The insulation will minimise heat loss in the winter , saving you money on your heating bills- and preventing your home getting too warm in the summer . <h> What is external- solid wall insulation ? <p> External wall insulation is a system of insulating material and render attached to the external walls of a property . <h> Are there different types of external- wall insulation ? <p> Yes there are several systems .

If not , all the existing render will need to be removed prior to attaching the insulation to the brickwork . If the render test shows the that existing render is firmly held in place , the render can be simply smoothed ready for the insulation to be applied directly on to it . <p> Another important step prior to installing any external wall insulation is to remove any pipework from the outside of the building . These will be reinstalled at the end of the process ( and maybe extended in some instances as necessary ) ; this is one of main reasons that the insulating process is expensive and time consuming . <p> The installation process is relatively complex , but the basic steps are outlined below : <p> Apply insulating panels to the wall using adhesive mortar <p> Plastic capped fixings are driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall to tie the panels securely to the wall <p> Mortar is then applied over the insulating panels and the fixings . <p> An insulating mesh is then sunk into the mortar to hold the panels rock hard in position . <p> The mortar is sanded and painted with primer to prepare it for the render <p> The rendered finish is applied ( available in any colour ! ) <h> What does external wall insulation look like ? <p> The most cost-effective way- of insulating your solid walls is- to finish it- with a simple white render . However there is a huge variety of finishes possible ; - smooth , textured or painted , tiled , panelled , pebble-dashed or finished with brick slips . <h> What should I bear in mind when having external- wall insulation installed ? <p> Youll need- to consider local building regulation .

From our experience of installing solid wall insulation across London , it seems there is no- standard approach to how the councils judge what is acceptable and what is n't , so if in doubt it is probably worth asking ! <h> How much does external wall insulation cost ? <p> The cost of- solid wall insulation is roughly -100/m2 , so it is not cheap , but it could be really worthwhile ! <h> Are there any grants available ? <p> There are no national grants available at the moment , but- check with your local council . <h> Installing solid wall insulation <p> Interested map . 184568 @qwx384568 <p> Interested in getting external solid wall insulation ?

@@36749086 @5749086/ <h> Will turning up the thermostat warm the house quicker ? <h> December 4 , 2015 <p> Most men appreciate a new gadget and I am no different " last week I had the new Heatmiser Smartstats installed in my home . These thermostats are the latest offering from Heatmiser and I have to say I am very impressed . <p> Anyway " the purpose of today 's blog is n't really to talk about the Smartstat thermostats , instead I want to answer a question my partner- asked since she now has an app to control the heating from her phone too ( which I know is dangerous ! ) <p> Her question was simple , <p> If the house is cold , will turning up the thermostat to 300c help warm up the house quicker . <p> The question sort of makes sense and I can see why she asked it . You turn up an oven and the food will cook quicker . The thing is though that thermostats do n't work like that ! <h> So first a quick recap on how thermostats work <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that travels around the heating system ( normally radiators ) , which warms them up . The hot radiators heat the air , which is why you feel nice and warm . <p> The thermostat job is to ensure that the room does n't get too warm . Without the thermostat , the boiler ( when switched on ) would keep producing hot water " so the radiators would stay hot and the room would get warmer and warmer . <p> The thermostat reads the ambient temperature and sends a message back to the boiler to turn off when the pre determined temperature is met . So for example if you set the thermostat to 21 degrees ( which is about average for most homes ) , then once the room reaches this temperature , the thermostat tells the boiler to switch off . <p> Obviously there is still hot water in the radiators , so the room will continue to warm up a bit , but very quickly the radiators will cool down and so the room will begin to cool down ( as heat escapes through walls / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 degrees , the thermostat will tell the boiler to turn on again , so the radiators will warm up " and this process just goes on and on the temperature fluctuating slightly around the 21 degrees mark . <h> So back to the question " Will turning up the thermostat heat my home faster ? <p> Hopefully you can now see the answer is no it wo n't . The boiler is the bit of kit in the house making the hot water , the thermoset just simply stops the home overheating . <p> The boiler will normally create hot water at the same rate " but obviously if you put a higher rated boiler ( i.e. from 16kW to 24kW for instance ) in your home then hot water will be produced at a quicker rate , so that could speed up the rate at which rooms heat up however it does seem a little extreme to replace your heating system to get the rooms to heat up quicker ! <p> If you do want to make your home warm up quicker , then the key is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulation / loft insulation / solid wall insulation / double glazing and draught proofing are all proven ways to get your home warmer quicker and they will also lower your energy bills . <p> The final thing worth mentioning is that the TRV controls on the radiators ( these are the valves with the numbered dials on ) work in the same way . Turning them up to max will absolutely make the room warmer , but it wo n't make any difference to the rate at which the room warms up ! <p> Many thermostats work comparable to the trv like Jim Oxlade suggested , that is they taper off before you reach desired temperature , slowing the rate of change for the room temperature . If you think about it depending on the system this means it reduces coil heat or it reduces the flames on an old boiler . <p> A way to help understand this is to put a cup of water in a pan , do this twice , then ignite the stove underneath each pan at full flame . About halfway through drop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both pans will reach boiling but the time delay would be in minutes . <p> Technically depending on how hot and what difference between current temp and desires temp you can speed up temperature change . However many smart thermostats prevent this by regulating the speed at which a house heats up not the temperature , so the rate of change will always be 1 minute per degree . <p> I disagree with the final paragraph . A thermostat is a simple on/off mechanism whereas a TRV opens and closes gradually , so as it approaches set temperature the rate of heating will decrease until TRV is totally closed . Ergo , set TRV to a higher setting and it will stay fully open for longer , thus warming the room faster . Just remember to reset TRV when room has reached required temperature .

It does not rely on air as a medium to carry the heat : instead the infrared waves are produced directly by the panel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which then absorbs it and warms up . <p> Since the energy is only turned into heat when it comes into contact with solid objects , draughty rooms pose no issue to the warmth felt . You may have come across infrared heating panels under umbrellas in the outside areas of restaurants .

Why is this ? <p> Infrared heating panels are energy efficient , since they take very little time to warm up and also are less impacted by draughts . If a cold draught enters a room with convection heating , the hot air will very quickly be stripped out and the occupants will once again feel cold .

They can be glass , mirrored , or printed with a favourite photo for a canvas effect . You can get panels that are very thin ( 2cm or less ) and can be hung anywhere . All they need is access to power , so no additional piping or lost floor space . <p> If you need higher powered infrared heating units than the panels , other infrared heaters go up to 2kW , so can provide you with the extra heat needed . They are perfect for bigger spaces like warehouses . These infrared heaters look very similar to the heaters you might see outside in restaurants , but they do n't  glow red hot - and are safer because of this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they act as mirrors , and we have even come across restaurants using them as menu boards . <p> One of the major benefits of infrared heating is that the panels are near enough maintenance-free , basically because they have no moving parts , and often manufacturers will offer 5 year guarantees to provide piece of mind . <p> In warehouses the infrared heating panels are ideal since they help reduce damp , because the infrared raises the temperature of any surface it hits . This can be very useful if the business is offering perishable goods . <h> How much do infrared panels cost ? <p> This is entirely dependent on the size of the panel , for example a 300w panel may cost as little -350 , while a bigger 850w panel may cost in the region of -330 .

Roman Britons used hypocausts , which involved suspended floors under which fires were lit , which then heated the floor and in turn heated the baths or rooms. - A network of small pipes was used to run hot air from a central furnace and heat up the building . This created a warm air convection which heated up the main living space . <p> Things have moved on slightly since , but radiant heating is a great economical way to heat- many areas of the home . There are now two preferred methods of underfloor heating for the home : electric under floor heating systems or hot water flowing in pipes just underneath the floor surface , known as hydronic systems . <p> Read on to find out about the different types of underfloor heating system . <h> Types of underfloor heating system <p> Modern underfloor heating systems use either electrical resistance elements ( electric systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see- ground source heat pumps ) to heat the floor . Either type can be installed as the primary , whole-building heating system or as localised floor heating for thermal comfort in a particular room . <h> Electric underfloor heating systems <p> Electric underfloor heating systems work by using electrical resistance elements . When the system is switched on , the system gets warm , heating the wooden , tiled or carpeted floors above it . The floor then acts as a large radiator ; hence underfloor heating is sometimes known as radiant heating . <p> This form of underfloor heating is very easy to install , and also it is very thin ( in- comparison- to the Hydronic systems ) , so you will not lose any height from your rooms if you retrofit this technology within your home . Also the- electrical- resistance elements that make up the system run at 100%- efficiency , so all the electricity that runs through them is turned into heat . The electric system you install will depend on the size of the room and type of flooring , but options include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , electric cable systems , or loose fit wiring flexible enough to fill more awkward spaces . <p> Most electric- underfloor heating systems are straightforward to install , assuming that you are reasonably competent at DIY . However all electric heating systems installed in the home must be signed off by a competent electrician under the 2005 Part P building regulations . <h> Hydronic underfloor heating systems <p> Hydronic underfloor heating systems rely on hot water heated within a boiler system ( or via a- Ground Source Heat Pump- or an- Air Source Heat Pump ) to provide the heat to warm the floor and the associated room . The hot water flows through pipes situated beneath the floor level which then heat the floor . As the heat is being given off by a larger area ( the entire floorspace ) , it does not need to be as hot as the water flowing through radiators , as it is more evenly distributed within the room . <p> Unlike the electrical underfloor heating systems , hydronic systems will cause you to lose some height of the room if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have a thicker profile than wires ) .

I knew that in the winter my bills would be higher and during the summer months these would come down a bit . <p> The purpose of this blog is to make you a little bit more aware of how the electricity companies decide how much to bill you ( it is not simply a finger in the air job surprisingly ! ! ) , and give you a little background on the Energy Mix in the UK ( i.e. the sources of electricity that electricity providers use ) . <h> What is a Watt ? ! <p> A light bulb in your home is measured in watts , which is a rate ( like miles / hour ) rather than a quantity . A Watt is equal to the number of joules used per second and is a measurement of power , for example , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so 50 joules / second , where as an equivalent energy saving light bulb potentially may only use 13 watts . The rate at which power is used by an appliance is not really helpful for making energy usage comparisons , instead we use a quantity measure . <h> What is a Kilowatt Hours <p> A kilowatt hour ( denoted kWh ) is the quantity measure that we use and is simply the number of watts ( divided by 1000 to make it Kw ) used in one hour . - You will notice if you have a look at your utility bill it gives you the amount owed based on the number of kWh used over a certain period . Elsewhere on TheGreenAge we have stated that an average house uses 4500kWh of energy per year . Looking at the electricity bill for my flat , we used 3100kWh of electricity last year at a rate of -0.1271 / kWh .

There are also energy suppliers that will supply you exclusively green energy , although as the -/kWh for green energy tends to be higher ( please see my blog on the Green Economy for reasons why ! ! ) , your utility bills will be at a premium . <h> The costs included in the -/kWh calculation <p> Unfortunately there is an added complication , when you look at the figure " e.g. 12 pence / kWh , it is not only the fuel costs that make up the 12 pence . The fuel component makes up between 60 " 80% of the bill . In addition however there are various other costs , including infrastructure costs which include things like energy loss in transmission from the power station through all the transmission lines and finally into your house . There are also cost to serve costs , which include the IT systems for managing bills , and electricity company wages and so forth . The cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal about 70-80% of your total bill . <p> The remaining 20-30% of the pence / kWh , are known as Pass Through Charges . These include the standing charge , which tends to be a fixed cost split over the billing period that goes towards the installation and maintenance of the electricity distribution network . In addition things like the settlement agency charge ( meter reading companies wages etc ) go through the pass through charges . <h> The Cost of Generating Electricity <p> All the Big 6 ' energy suppliers are publically listed companies ; therefore they are all directly responsible to their shareholders . As a result they are all trying increase shareholder value , which in the utility business is being able to buy / produce energy at the lowest possible cost , and then sell it at the highest possible price they can without affecting demand . <p> The electricity that you or I pull from the electric plug sockets in our houses obviously is the same regardless of what source it comes from . So it makes sense that the companies focus on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ? <p> Well coal ( unfortunately ) is currently about the cheapest source of electricity , followed by hydroelectric , nuclear , gas , then wind and finally solar . However , while fossil fuel kWh have remained relatively constant , they can only go up as supply diminishes and a value is put onto carbon emissions . Meanwhile , the prices of solar PV and wind are dropping dramatically as the technology improves and economies of scale come into play . <h> Flexibility by Source <p> The other thing that the electricity companies need to take into account is being able to provide electricity even when there are sudden peaks in demand . Well the theory behind matching supply and demand of electricity is relatively simple . More inflexible sources such as nuclear power , which take days to bring online and produce power , are on the whole time providing the base power to the energy mix . More flexible sources are used such as gas to match regular peaks in demand ( gas power plants can come on line in minutes ) like when the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utility companies do to meet unusual sudden peaks in demand ?

When these sudden surges in demand take place , the plant is switched on allowing the water to fly down through the turbines via gravity , producing electricity . In the case of the Dinorwig power plant in Wales , from producing no electricity at all to maximum output takes only12 seconds . <p> Adding complexity to the supply /demand on the grid is the current push for low emission green energy sources like solar and wind .

As always , I implore all of you to look very seriously at maximising energy efficiency measures installed in your house such as insulation and energy saving lightbulbs , as these will lower your bills . <p> Also with much of our base power going offline in the next 10 years or so ( with nuclear plants being decommissioned ) , now is the perfect time to install your own solar panels / wind turbines or even micro hydro electric- ( if possible ) to generate your own electricity .

This backing has added a philosophical element- to an already confusing environmental movement . <h> Why are ecomodernists different to traditional environmentalists ? <p> To put it simply : the environmentalist movement advocates a prescribed set of ideals that is at odds with how society is developing today . Traditional environmentalists have for many years stated that human societies need to be reintegrated into the natural ecosystem using natural products , utilising organic farming techniques for food cultivation and harnessing energy through renewable energy . Environmentalists do n't believe that the current capitalist system is compatible with the preservation of the planet ; in fact the belief is that economic growth is perfectly correlated with an increase in pollution and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , believe that humans do not need to be at one with nature to preserve the planet and live sustainably , but rather just use resources more efficiently and effectively to allow humans and nature to prosper in harmony . For example , ecomodernists want to limit the amount of land that is used for farming , but at the same time use technology to increase crop yields so that more food can be cultivated to feed the growing global population. - Ecomodernists do n't just advocate- renewable energy , but believe in nuclear being central to the energy requirements needed over the next few centuries . <p> Before we endorse some of these ideas we have to have a look at the solutions that they advocate . <h> What solutions do ecomodernist theorists actually believe in ? <p> According to the authors of the ecomodernist manifesto , the aim is to make energy efficiency and the green agenda much more appealing to the broader constituency of people .

For example , the UK needs more than -100billion of investment over the next decade to go into infrastructure ( upgrade the grid ) and new generation plants to replace what is being decommissioned and closed off . <p> The grid network system is archaic and needs to move into the 21st century . Nuclear power plants are being decommissioned and coal power plants will be closed off completely in the next 10 or so years to ensure the government meets its decarbonisation policy . <p> The advocates of the ecomodernist agenda have a one-time ' opportunity to push various solutions in the UK to resolve grid efficiency and electricity generation whilst meeting climate change targets . <p> The- public will need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existing economy ( wages and jobs ) . <h> Does ecomodernism have to be tied to a manifesto ? <p> The simple answer is that if ecomodernism were to become a popular term for the preservation of our planet and sustainable development ( where we do n't have to trade off growth vs. environment ) , it should not be limited to a prescriptive list of solutions in a theoretical essay ' , written by a group of scientists . It really needs to draw upon the public imagination to reach a consensus on what would be acceptable and workable solutions that not only decarbonise the economy but also continue growth and prosperity . <h> What solutions would be acceptable to the public ? <p> Most people would not disagree with- the list of solutions explored in the ecomodernist manifesto .

The guaranteed price that EDF has agreed with the government to sell the electricity generated to the counterparties for is -92.50/MW . Yet , given that other renewables like wind power and solar are slowly getting more efficient , one could argue whether there is actually a need for such an investment when , at the end of the day ( at this strike price ) the electricity will be quite expensive . <p> Surely the UK should now be looking at exploiting more offshore wind as well as solar power because the price of those technologies is dropping . With its positioning as an island ( and thus surrounded by water ) , the UK should really be looking at developing tidal lagoons . It could become a global leader in wave and tidal power given the investment that will go into developing the energy sector over the next few years. - <p> Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency scheme ) , there has n't  been a clear strategy on how UK home owners and businesses can use- existing energy resources more efficiently .

A smarter and more responsive grid is better than a centralised and wasteful one that currently serves the UK . <h> A final word <p> Most of the ecomodernist ideas seem- ok , but it needs to bring on board additional solutions to appeal more to the public at large .

@@36749095 @5749095/ <h> An introduction to cavity wall insulation <h> June 24 , 2016 <p> All information correct as of - June 2016 <h> What is cavity wall insulation ? <p> Properties built since the 1930s usually have cavity walls . These are built from two layers " or skins ' " of bricks , with an air gap between them . This air gap or cavity as it is more commonly known was introduced in an effort to reduce damp and condensation on internal walls . <p> During the 1970s there was a worldwide energy crisis where many industrial countries struggled for supplies of oil and gas , so there was a sudden spike in energy prices . One of the results of this was a massive push towards energy efficiency and as such this air space within the cavity walls suddenly fulfilled a further purpose " a space to house insulation ! <p> It is possible to both insulate existing cavity walls by injecting them with insulation as well as new cavity walls ( the insulation is positioned within the cavity during the construction phase ) . <p> Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government grants have encouraged retrofitting , it 's pretty rare these days to find a house which has n't had cavity wall insulation installed . It has been popular for years due to its low cost and the ease with which it can be installed . <p> With up to 35% of heat lost through external walls , insulating a cavity- wall helps to provide a thermal- barrier , considerably slowing heat transfer . This means less heating is needed to keep the house at the required temperature . In the summer , the reverse happens ; hot air outside the home ca n't get in as easily , which means you do n't need to use energy to keep the home cool . Therefore , cavity wall insulation can make a difference to your energy bills all year round . <h> What materials are used for cavity wall insulation ? <p> Modern cavity walled properties are built with insulation already in place , usually rigid board insulation . When insulation is retrofitted in an older property , the options are fiberglass-type insulation or polystyrene bead insulation , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beads <p> Polystyrene beads are a great insulator and they spread out to fill the cavity and they wo n't leave gaps , unlike wool can " the beads are injected with a glue that binds them together once situated in the wall . <p> Foam insulation <p> One advantage of foam insulation is that it can be used for narrow cavities , and smaller holes ( 8mm ) will be drilled into the brickwork . Unfortunately , older styles of foam insulation degrade over time and can give off gases . Modern versions do not have this problem . However , it can be expensive and installers may be difficult to find because it is the installation process is trickier . <p> Blown mineral wool <p> Mineral wool consists of granulated spun glass or rock wool . A plus is that it 's non-combustible but it can clump together resulting in uneven distribution within the cavity wall " potentially resulting in cold spots . <h> How is cavity wall insulation installed ? <p> Retrofitting cavity wall insulation only takes a few hours on an average house . The gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulating materials . Small holes are drilled in the brickwork and the wall is then injected with the material of your choice . <h> Is my home suitable for cavity wall insulation ? <p> The best way to tell if your wall has a cavity is to look at exposed brickwork . If the wall only has- stretcher bricks , ( i.e. the bricks are all uniform and look the same length ) then it is likely that you have cavity walls . If you can also see half bricks , it 's a solid wall ( in which case , you could consider external wall insulation ) . Not all cavity walls are suitable for insulating , however . <p> You should have a pre-installation survey to look for any existing defects such as damaged pointing or debris in the cavity . These could encourage damp and cavity wall insulation should not be installed until these problems are rectified . Another point of consideration is whether or not the property is regularly exposed to wind-driven rain . Get a trustworthy assessor to have a look before starting any work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second opinion ! <h> Are there any downsides of cavity wall insulation ? <p> It can encourage damp by allowing rainwater to track along the cavity . However this depends on the property and the insulating material . If your home has no underlying structural problems and you 've had the work installed by a good worksman then you should be fine . <h> How much does cavity wall insulation cost ? <p> Whitewool costs around -7 per square metre , beads around -9 per metre squared . It could save on average around -300 a year . This means with most properties it will pay for itself within two years . <h> Are there any grants or funding for cavity wall insulation ? <p> Yes !

Obviously there is no end to the amount of figures and percentages stating how much better they are than the incandescent and halogen bulbsbut what does it actually mean , how much could they save per year and what is their payback ? <h> LEDs give you- savings all year round <p> Most energy saving measures rely on the heating within the home . This often means that the savings are only seen throughout winter when the outside temperature drops but installed insulation means you do n't have to have the heating on as much . However lighting is something that is required all year round whilst- the savings are often ignored . <h> Case Study of an LED upgrade <p> I have decided to use a worked example in the hope that people will have the confidence to buy LEDs and start being more efficient immediately . This case study is a real property , located in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaved money off the owners ' electricity bill . <p> Previous to TheGreenAge 's intervention , they had 35 halogen spotlights , each one guzzling 50W .

This meant that- their electricity bill , for lighting only , come in at around -399.22 . <p> Now what we did- was to switch over to LEDs . These provide the same fantastic lumen output to halogens as well as being available in a choice of colour temperatures , while importantly running off a fraction of the electricity . <h> How much did they save ? <p> So those 35 x 50W , GU10 halogen spotlights were replaced , without the need to alter the fittings , with direct 5W LED replacements . This meant that instead of 1,750W , they were now only using 175W to light their home , dropping their bills to just -39.92 " a massive saving of -359.98 per year ! <p> productbox id= " 6842 ? /productbox <p> Now obviously LED bulbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed and manufactured to last around 25 years . So those 35 bulbs that have been replaced will save an estimated- -8,999.50 over the course of their lifetime . <p> Each bulb costs around -8.99 , - so the whole order was -314.65 that 's a payback of well under a year and clearly makes changing your lighting one of the most important efficiency measure to do . <p> Want to know more about LED bulbs ? click HERE for our buyers guide to LED bulbs ! <h> 6 comments <p> This is a must for everyone , I changed all the lights in our home last year , replaced around 80 bulbs with led alternatives , based on 5 hours usage every day with varying watts etc the original bulbs cost between -700 and -1000 every year to run ! ! ! ! Replacement led bulbs reduced the bill to a little over -100 with the cost of the bulbs being recouped in under 6 months due to savings ! The best things I have found apart from the obvious savings are- 1 ) I never have to replace blown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fantastic in bathrooms , everything looks so clean and crisp 3 ) Instead of using the equivalent power of 16 solar panels just to offset lighting now 2 panels can produce enough power for all the lighting ! 4 ) So much cooler ! No heat is given from any of the lighting now which in the summer makes a huge difference but in the winter it is obviously more efficient to just turn the heating up a degree instead of heat from lights . Honestly I 'm not a world saving hippy but LED should be the standard now . <p> Well , I just found LED bulbs at the dollar store ( similar to Pound Land ) for $1 each . I just wish I had an option for my motion sensor locations , but unfortunately I have to change he fixtures and the switches there .

Bricks are built to last hundreds of years . The mortar surrounding them , however , is sadly not . This pointing ' will need a little TLC from time to time . <h> Why should I have my walls repointed ? <p> Aside from helping to hold up your house , mortar protects against water ingress and.helps prevent heat loss through the walls .

This freeze-thaw weathering does not look good and ignoring damaged or substandard mortar could lead to a damp and cold house . <h> How do I know if my walls need repointing ? <p> If you can see gaps in the mortar surrounding bricks , its time to think about repointing . <h> Can I repoint walls myself ? <p> The materials for the job are not expensive , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its a time-consuming task and some areas can be hard to reach . Pointing is sometimes done with cement , but it is worth spending a bit more on the traditional lime mortar .

This means that wetting and drying of the wall happens in the bricks themselves , resulting in frost damage . You will end up with the bricks eroding before the pointing , which is exactly what you do not want . <h> How much does repointing cost ? <p> It should cost between -20--40 per metre-squared , depending on the condition of the brickwork . Scaffolding may add to the price . However , it 's well worth spending a bit of money . The pointing should last 50-100 years , so you probably wo n't need to do it again in your lifetime !

In this announcement , support has been given to insulation , heating and glazing measures . If a householder is in a position to take advantage of all the offers ( i.e. Solid wall insulation , 2 measures from the other list , the new home owner bonus and the Green Deal rebate ) , - they can get- -5,600- towards the cost of the works . <p> In this article we will provide our own unique view on what measures will give you the best financial return . <p> We have been involved with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have followed and closely examined every change . In addition , we undertake 1000s of Green Deal Assessments and home energy surveys each month so we are fairly confident we can highlight how you can best benefit from the new GDHIF . <h> How is GDHIF phase 3 different to the original GDHIF ? <p> The good news is that GDHIF phase 3 is not really that different from the scheme that launched originally during 2014- in terms of how it works and the framework behind it , however there are a couple of- changes worth highlighting . <p> The first is that the grant for solid wall insulation has been lowered slightly , with only -3,750 now available for existing homeowners ( occupiers or landlords ) . If you are new homeowner though ( i.e you have lived in the property less than 12 months ) you can get the new homeowner bonus which is an- additional -500 taking the total to- -4,250 for new homeowners ( occupiers or landlords ) . <p> The good news is that although the solid wall grant has gone down by -250 since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two measures has gone up by -250 taking it to a total of -1250 . If the- - homeowner bonus applies this takes the- potential grant to -1750 so if you are thinking of installing a boiler and new double glazing now may be the time ! <p> The final change is nothing to do with the amount of funds available . When the popularity of phase 1 of the scheme was highlighted by DECC , people panicked because they thought they might miss out on the grant . This led to a frantic dash in the last few days of the scheme as people tried to get their vouchers through . For us , we did hundreds of assessments in those last few days as news of the impending closure of the scheme spread . <p> This resulted in DECC changing the scheme when phase 2 was released in December 2014 they made it a condition that a proper quote was required ( and signed by the installer ) and this was to be submitted during the- voucher claim process . <p> While there was still a frantic dash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money lasted just 30 hours ) , however the need for a proper quote did mean that everyone going for the grant actually wanted- it ! In phase 3 of the scheme , this quote is still needed , so if you are interested in trying to claim the voucher please have your quote and green deal / EPC report ready ! <p> We think there will be just as much of a mad dash this time round , so it pays to move as quickly as possible so as to not be disappointed . <h> GDHIF phase 3 and Solid Wall Insulation <p> It is now really apparent that the Government wants the solid wall insulation industry to establish itself here in the UK , hence this further pot of cash being made available . <p> Although the -3,750 grant has been reduced from -4,000 for existing homeowners , most of us agree that the new revised amount is still a pretty good deal for the consumer ; and an amazing deal for new homeowners with -4,250 available. - However , with cuts to the ECO obligation earlier in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to directly help support this measure through general taxation rather than having it funded by the utility companies . <p> Solid wall insulation , if you have a pre-1930s solid brick property is the only way you can insulate the property " there is no cavity that you can inject . You can however choose to have the insulation installed externally or internally or a combination of both . The- headline figures say you are- entitled to a grant of the -3,750 / -4,250 , this is this will help support- 67% of the total cost of the works " so you still have to pay for a third of the work yourself regardless although you can use Green Deal finance to fund the difference between the cost of the works and the grant amount . So , if your quote is over -5,597 ( existing homeowners ) / -6,343 ( new homeowners ) for the work you will get maximum support . The other condition is that you have to have at least 50% or more of the exposed external walls insulated to be eligible . <p> Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some advice , you may have had to pay for a Green Deal Assessment , the Government have made an additional -100 to help cover this Green Deal charge , <p> Our verdict is that solid wall insulation via GDHIF phase 3 is still a great offer , and while these jobs are n't cheap typically in London we are seeing quotes of -8,000 to -10,000 " the grant does provide a big chunk of support . <p> It does n't end there though , if you have had a Green Deal Assessment you can top-up the -4,600 with Green Deal Finance , which could be worth another -2,000 + ( subject to the savings highlighted on the report ) . <h> New heating systems with GDHIF phase 3 <p> Under the original GDHIF scheme , customers were cleverly installing the flue gas heat recovery system measure along with a new boilers to get in certain scenarios up to a maximum of -1,600 off the cost of a new boiler . This little loophole has been closed unfortunately and going forward if customers want a new heating system they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 other measures available . <p> This is n't the end of the world though and we feel the Government are spot on in terms of prioritising insulation above everything else as a driver to this scheme . For instance if you have cavity walls , you can combine cavity wall insulation as your second measure , which would enable you to go for the boiler option . <p> If you have leaky doors , then you can have 2 energy efficiency doors installed , but each one of them will set you back -1,000 each . With another -2,000 potentially for a new boiler , the total cost could set you back -4,000 so that you get -1,250 off the price ! <p> Storage heaters and highly efficient warm air units are also available as measures from this list , so if you are thinking of replacing any of these have a look at the insulation and glazing options also currently available to get your 2 measures . <p> Do n't forget Green Deal Finance ! If you are a new homeowner and you do n't have a heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assessment , you will realise large savings from installing a brand new heating system . With those big savings expected you will be able to access large amount of Green Deal Finance , which in most cases we have seen could pay for the full installation cost of the new boiler . The difference obviously is that with Green Deal Finance unlike GDHIF you will be paying the finance back through your electricity bills and with typically 6.96% interest . <p> However if you have just moved and are cash strapped then this could well be a viable option . <h> Other Insulation measures with GDHIF phase 3 <p> Cavity wall insulation , room-in roof , floor and flat roof insulation are all available as measures that quality for the -1,250 voucher ( with an additional -500 bonus if you have recently moved in ) . It is worth repeating though , that you will need to have 2 types of measure installed out of the 11 available to quality for it ( e.g. boiler + cavity wall insulation ) <p> If you have a single storey extensions built over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make use of this scheme ! <p> We have seen many properties that have been built quite recently ( 25-50 years ago ) , with cavity walls and flat roof extensions that have really poor insulation . This may be a perfect time to have that flat roof re-felted and also insulted . The changes with RdSAP for assessments mean that if you have a Green Deal Assessment since- 8th December 2014 , assessors will be able to recommend flat roof insulation as an improvement without having to do an intrusive inspection and just by going off the age band of construction . <p> If the extension was built in this period ( after the war but before 1990 ) , the cavity walls could also be filled . In summary , the GDHIF could make it really attractive to make your extension nice , warm and cosy . <p> Otherwise , room-in-roof insulation , large flat roof areas and floor insulation are actually quite expensive , and while the -1,250 could make a little dent in the amount you have to pay , it may only cover 10% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Condensing mains gas boiler ( one only ) <p> Cavity Wall Insulation ( at least 50% of the external wall ) <p> Secondary glazing ( at least 50% of the glazing ) <p> Double / Triple glazing ( when replacing single glazing and at least 50% of the glazing ) <p> Flat roof insulation ( total area of all flat roof ) <p> Replacement warm-air unit <p> Fan-assisted storage heaters ( at least three ) <p> Energy Efficient replacement doors ( at least two ) <p> Floor insulation ( at least 50% of the ground floor ) <p> Room-in roof insulation ( 100% of roof area ) <p> Waste water heat recovery <h> Is GDHIF any good for double glazing ? <p> If you have existing double glazing , then there is little point in replacing it since the energy savings will be marginal . Glazing only forms about 15% of the surface area of a typical property and replacing it actually very expensive compared to the energy savings . If you do want to replace the double glazing and you have existing double glazing there is all a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Green Deal Assessment so you would n't be able to select it as one of your measures . <p> The double glazing option only works if you are doing general home improvement , apart from just the windows themselves . Please note double glazing is expensive and can cost -10,000s , and the GDHIF may only reduce the upfront cost by 5-15% . <h> GDHIF Phase 3 final verdict <p> We are delighted to welcome GDHIF back , after a couple of months of uncertainty and the closure of the previous GDHIF scheme for solid wall insulation 30 hours after launch in December 2014 . With- household incomes still under great pressure , it is absolutely imperative for UK homes to be upgraded to higher energy efficiency standards " to keep energy bills under control and keep us warm &amp; cosy in the Winter and cool &amp; comfortable in the summer . <p> We expect the scheme to be very popular like the original GDHIF , and the December 2014 version , so if you do want to improve the energy efficiency of your home it might be time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Green Deal Assessment , EPC or even a external solid wall insulation quote by filling in the form below or calling us on 0208 144 0897 but please specify exactly what you are looking for in the comments box . <p> Interested in a Green Deal assessement to take advantage of finance and the GDHIF ? <h> 4 comments <p> We saw exceptional demand for surveys leading up to the second release of GDHIF , therefore if you are interested in taking advantage of the scheme regardless of where you are in the UK , I recommend getting in touch with an assessor company ASAP to ensure they can fit you in . Remember if you secure yourself a voucher for the works then you have 6 months to finish them and if you do secure the voucher , you can then change your chosen installer to someone else ( provided they are still signed up to the GDHIF scheme ) .

Clearly , it wo n't reduce noise travelling through walls- interior noise , but if road noise is your problem it could help . <p> The panels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be removed without fuss on warm days. - In the same way as double glazing , air is trapped in the- gap between the secondary glazing and your window , which- means some of the sound making its way through the external window pane dissipates when it bounces of the Ecoease panel , meaning less sound vibrates through into- your home . In fact , Ecoease can reduce noise up to 55% vs. 4mm glass- that 's 13 decibels ! <h> Rockwool <p> Another cost-effective choice is Rockwool . There are various products available , depending on where you would like to install it . It can be used in walls , lofts and floors . It insulates against sound as well as heat loss . <p> The open porous structure of stone wool means it is highly efficient against noise pollution . here 's the science of how it soaks- up airborne sound : as sound energy travels through fibres in the material , trapped air molecules- move back and forth inside and dissipate sound energy as tiny amounts of heat . <p> Its made from a sustainable , natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth .

The main reason people choose to install the measure is to keep their homes warmer and to lower their energy bills , as less heating escapes through the walls . However , it has the added benefit of having soundproofing qualities . The extent of this depends on which insulation material you opt to use , with a mineral wool system costing more but also blocking more noise from outside . <p> These measures can keep you warm , improve the safety of your home and reduce annoying noise entering from outside .

The vermiculite is heated to extremely high temperatures , and this then expands to produce ultra-lightweight aerated particles which consist of about 90% air . <h> How does Micafil perform ? <p> In the following section we are going to compare Micafil to more traditional rolls of loft insulation ( Earthwool ) . <h> Energy performance of Micafil loft insulation <p> Micafil has a thermal conductivity of 0.063 W/mK .

In order to reach building regulations you would require a 380mm layer of Micafil , but only 270mm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are not as high as the more commonly-used rolls of loft insulation . <h> Price of Micafil loft insulation <p> The price of Micafil is approximately -20 per bag " and one bag of this will cover 1m2 to a depth of 100mm . <p> The price of a roll of Earthwool is -18 per roll ( at B&amp;Q ) and will cover about 8.30m2 to a depth of 100mm .

It is extremely lightweight , so it wo n't compress the underlying insulation , but also the small particles fill in gaps where the rolls of insulation do n't quite butt up to one another , giving you complete coverage . <p> It is also the perfect product if you have uneven joist gaps , but to be honest , even then the rolls of wool can be cut relatively easy with the Stanley knife ! <p> If you are insulating your loft for the first time , we would always recommend using rolls of loft insulation due to the improved thermal performance of this type of insulation , coupled with the fact it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Have you used Micafil to insulate your loft ?

The power available for the wind that- is blowing is the cube of the wind speed " this is absolutely fundamental , and this can be seen in the simple sums below : <p> 3mph " 3 x 3 x 3 = 27kWh <p> 6mph " 6 x 6 x 6 = 216kWh <p> 12mph " 12 x 12 x 12 = 1,728kWh <p> This- is excellent news , as the further you get away from the surface of the earth and its many obstructions ( e.g. houses ) , the higher the wind speed : therefore the more power in the wind . This means it is important to try and maximise the height of any tower you use , to try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Swept area <p> The swept area is the circle that the turbine produces when spinning , so this is the diameter of the blades . The blades are driven by the power in the wind , so the larger your swept area , the more energy you can harness . Again the easiest way to illustrate- this is with some more simple sums ( apologies for those adverse to maths ! ) , where the area of a circle is half the diameter2- x - . ( - = 3.14 ) <p> 3 foot diameter = 1.5 x 1.5 x 3.14 =- 7ft2 <p> 6 foot diameter = 3 x 3 x 3.14 = 28ft2 <p> 12 foot diameter = 6 x 6 x 3.14 = 113ft2 <p> Taking into account these two factors , you can see the maximum electricity you can produce . Remember that wind speed is free ( although towers obviously cost more money the higher they are ) , while investing in bigger and bigger turbines gets more expensive . <h> What size turbine should you be looking at ? <p> The size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity you are looking to produce ( but potentially constrained- by windspeed and space ) , and secondly the amount of cash you have available . <p> Unlike- solar photovoltaic cells- that can be added to fairly easily as additional funds become available , the turbine blades would need to be replaced , and potentially the generator changed if you want to produce more power in the future. - Home scale generators normally are between 8 and 25 feet in diameter ( so a swept area of between 50 " 500 feet2 ) . If you have an average wind speed of 10 mph , these could produce between 1,000 and 15,000 kWh . An average house uses approximately 4,800 kWh per year , so a 25 foot diameter turbine is going to produce a serious excess of power to sell back to the grid , or power more than one house . <h> Final thoughts on wind turbines <h> Planning permission <p> Contact your local council to ask about planning permission if you 're considering installing a wind turbine . The majority of local authorities are keen to encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good idea to consult your neighbours before investing time and money into the planning phase , to allow them to voice any objections . <h> Average wind speed <p> Before you even consider investing in a wind turbine , you need to check your average wind speed . The- Carbon Trust- have created a tool that allows you to estimate the wind yield at your home location . You are looking for an average- wind speed in excess of 5m/s. - By providing simple information regarding your location and type of turbine , the tool will give you average wind speed and potential energy output . <h> Subsidies <p> In the- UK , as a wind turbine owner you can benefit from the- Feed-in tariffs . There are different allowances depending on the power output of your equipment . Wind turbines above 5MW are classified as commercial and alternatively benefit from the- Renewable Obligation Certificates . The Feed-in tariffs basically provide you with a source of income for every kWh of electricity you produce . This is independent from any excess electricity you sell back to the grid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ export tariff . This can really help a wind turbine become an economically viable system to put into your house . 
@@36749107 @5749107/ <h> What energy tariff should I be on ? <h> February 15 , 2016 <h> What energy tariff should I be on ? <p> Energy tariffs are complicated beasts . Pence per kilowatt , standing charge , tariff duration , tariff name Deciding where to start often leaves people utterly bewildered . However , were here to strip it back and ensure you get the best possible price for your usage , your property and your lifestyle . After all , everyone is different . It is almost impossible to guarantee yourself the best tariff without going into a bit more detail . <h> Overview of- available energy tariffs <p> Here we give you a brief overview of all the available tariffs and why some can be good , others bad , depending- on your specific situation . <h> Who wants a fixed energy tariff <p> These are tariffs that guarantee the customer a set price until a set date . These tariffs can be great , as you have peace of mind that you know how much your bills will be ( to a certain extent ) until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the standard tariffs . However , they are n't  the most flexible available and you may find you do n't  benefit from temporary reductions in energy prices although you should benefit over the course of the tariff due to general trends in global prices . Early exit fees also may cause you to regret your decision to nail yourself down to a long tariff ; make sure you do your homework so you know what your getting into . <h> What about a standard rate energy tariff <p> The default tariff is often the tariff that people find themselves on if they move to a new house . If the previous occupier ends his or her contract , the current electricity supplier will simply put the tariff back onto standard . The good thing is that these tariffs do n't  require a payment to leave . So moving to a new house , you can quickly change tariff or even supplier without having a pay a leaving charge . It also gives you flexibility if you ever leave the property or are waiting for a better deal elsewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariffs are often the most expensive around and can often change in the blink of an eye . <h> Should I go for an online energy tariff <p> For an energy provider , an online customer- saves a lot of money and labour . This is why they will often give you a small discount per month on your bills if you switch to online billing . They then send you emails with your bills attached and get you to send in your meter readings every month for up to date readings . Perfect tariff , saves you money and prevents excess paper being used . <h> How much do I save on a Dual Fuel energy tariff <p> Dual fuel tariffs are when you receive your gas and electricity from the same provider . The good thing about this is that it makes the process easier one payment each month and usually both fuels are condensed onto one bill giving you less paper and post/emails to deal with . Dual fuel tariffs are also cheaper than single fuel most of the time , and providers try and captures customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not head blindly straight for a dual fuel tariff . Sometimes it does pay to get your gas from one and your electricity from the other , even though it is slightly more hassle . <h> Top-up or Pre-pay energy tariff <p> These are effectively pay-as-you-go tariffs . Much like with you phone bills , - pay-as-you-go is easy as it limits you to use the gas and electricity that you can afford at the particular time as you top up when you get low by heading to your local shop or topping up on your phone ( only available with some providers ) . Pay-as-you-go tariffs also make you realise the items and appliances in your home that- use the- most electricity and gas . However , it is commonly known that- pay-as-you-go tariffs are the most expensive tariffs that you can go for , just like mobile phone bills . These tariffs also require a different meter so changing can be quite expensive . <h> How Green is a- Green energy tariff <p> Green tariffs , on the face of things , are great . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy that you provider may be promising is n't quite as good as it seems . The fact of the matter is that electricity that you get through your plugs , is from the most local point of generation . So even if you tariff says 50% renewable electricity but you live next to a fossil fuelled power plant , you will be getting 100% of your electricity from that power plant . The way the provider can do this is by buying 50% of whatever your generation is at an increased cost as it is renewable , it does n't  mean it is coming to your home . These Green tariffs are almost always more expensive that standard tariffs as a result of them having to counter the additional cost they spend- in buying the renewable electricity . <h> Standing charge and unit rate <p> One of the most important things to look at , which often gets ignored , is the pricing within the tariff . Many just look at the unit price and base their decision on that . However , in many cases the tariffs with low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go for ? High standard charge &amp; low unit price , or low standing charge &amp; high unit price . The choice is based on your usage . You will be paid your standard charge no matter how much energy you use . So in holiday homes it would make sense to go for a small standing charge with a higher unit price , as you wont be using as much energy over the course of the year . However , if you are a high user , perhaps retired and always in the property then you should look for high standing charge and low unit prices . <h> What tariff are we on ? <p> Nick : " We have a pretty high unit price with a low- standard charge at home . This is because we 've become pretty energy efficient over the past few years . Swapping halogen bulbs to LEDs mean that high unit prices do n't  really affect us like they used to , so we 've benefitted through the low standing charge . Think wed be paying through the roof if we were efficient though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 . Theyve just offered a fixed 3 year tariff but the price increase was ridiculous so Ill stick with the year by year fixed tariffs . I went with a very low unit price- as I tend to get through- quite a lot , however the standing charge is n't too bad either . " <p> Henry : " Fairly low user to be honest . Working most of the day so do n't  use much energy Monday to Friday . The weekends I 'm usually out and about as well so it benefits me to have a lower standing charge and slightly higher unit price . Although I 'm on quite a good deal at the moment so its all pretty good . Energy efficient as well with LED bulbs and lots of thick jumpers for the winter . " <p> James : " Heavy usage ! Not me though , I try to keep costs down- but while I 'm out I swear the cats turn all the lights and electrical appliances on .

@@36749110 @5749110/ <h> Introduction to Draught Proofing <h> Insulation <h> What is draught proofing ? <p> Draught proofing ( or draught exclusion ) - is one of the cheapest and easiest ways to cut- energy costs in the home , whether you live in a house or a flat . The concept is really simple : stop cold air coming in and prevent warm air from escaping , using things like draught excluders . Keeping the warm air inside will save you money on your utility bills as the existing heating system will need to work less hard to keep the home at the required temperature . <p> Draughts or gaps in the home act like unwanted ventilation shafts , allowing cold air to seep in and hot air to escape . When the household heats their home , these uncontrolled ventilation gaps let expensive hot air escape . <p> Although more often than not , some heat escapes regardless of the actions of a householder , additional temporary draughts occur by leaving doors , windows and letterboxes- open . <h> Potential savings from installing draught proofing <p> It is estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could- save the household -60 per year on heating bills . <p> According to the- Energy Saving Trust , if every home- were to do this in the UK , the total energy savings could be worth as much as -190 million , and the energy saved would heat nearly 400,000 homes . <h> How do I- identify a draught ? <p> You- will be able to find- draughts- just about- anywhere in your- house that links- directly- to the outside . You could easily be in front of one now . They are found by doors , windows , loft hatches , keyholes , electrical fittings on the ceilings , under the floorboards , piping leading outside and any drilled holes for cabling that leads outside . Remember that day when you had that cable or Sky TV installed and the drilling that took place ? <p> The best way to deal with these draughts is to close the gaps using draught excluders- and block the- holes . <h> -59.99 <p> Some rooms in the home need natural ventilation , such as bathrooms , kitchens or rooms with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of condensation and by blocking the ventilation outlets , you may also encourage damp and mould to form , which may end up being- unpleasant and costing you additional money- to fix . <h> Draught proofing DIY vs. professional jobs <p> Draught- proofing pays for itself in just a couple of years in most cases , by reducing your energy consumption and therefore your energy bills . Draught proofing can be a fairly- simple home- DIY job , although for more complex measures , help may be required . <p> Obviously , if you are uncomfortable carrying out the work yourself we strongly recommend- getting in a professional to complete the work regardless . A- professional should be able to identify draughts- very quickly , and will know- what to fill them with , therefore saving you a lot of time and energy . <h> Draught Proofing Problem Areas <h> Insulation <h> Where to look for draughts <p> Pipes and vents are areas that you may over look when considering draught proofing your home . Draught proofing these areas is easily done , affordable and effective . <h> How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found in the area where pipes pass through walls and floorboards ; draught proofing these areas is a simple but effective way of stemming the heat loss flow . Foam-based fillers are simple and great for draughting proofing irregular gaps like the ones caused by pipes . However , as with all other draught proofing measures , if you do not feel comfortable in your DIY skills , we advise getting a professional draught proofer to do it for you . <p> Similar to the areas around pipes , you may find sites that should be draught proofed around retrofitted vents . In these cases , foam fillers should be used , although rigid filler may also be used if a smooth finish is preferable . <h> Air bricks and bathroom vents <p> A word of caution : there are some areas- that should never be blocked off or insulated . Air bricks are there for a reason " to prevent your floorboards and wooden supports from rotting . A constant flow of air is needed to prevent damp from entering the property and running havoc . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept free to allow air into the area , so it is essential not to block this off . <p> The same goes for vents in the bathroom , as damp can easily build up in these humid- rooms without adequate- ventilation . So remember , draught proofing is great , but allow your home breathing space ! <h> Draught Proofing Chimneys <h> Insulation <h> Why should I draught-proof my chimney ? <p> Even after completely draught-proofing your windows , doors and floors , you may still be left with a large area of concern in the shape of the chimney stack . A lot of heat can be lost through an uninsulated- chimney . Unless your chimney is never used , you need to choose a temporary draught-proofing solution that can be removed as and when you want to light the fire . <h> Draught-proofing chimneys with a Chimney Sheep <p> For the most sustainable method of chimney draught-proofing , try a Chimney Sheep . These are made from 100% pure and natural sheep wool for the excluder and recycled plastic for the handle . Siting snuggly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside and the warm indoors . The Chimney Sheep has a strong and rigid centre , which allows it to remain in place up the chimney , and a more flexible outer circumference enabling each size to fit a wide variety of chimney shapes and sizes . <h> - Draught proofing chimneys with chimney balloons <p> There is a really easy solution to prevent these draughts , which does not involve permanently boarding up your fireplace or blocking your chimney . You can use a chimney balloon . <p> A chimney balloon is essentially a balloon that you inflate in your chimney that creates a snug fit , thereby preventing hot air escaping up out of the chimney or cold air dropping down it , helping to prevent draughts in your home . <p> You position the balloon up in the lower regions of the chimney stack and then inflate it , which holds it in place . The balloon is designed to stop the majority of airflow , but it will still allow a little ventilation so you do n't have any damp issues . <p> The inflated balloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a fire , at which point you deflate the bag and store it , ready for it to be re-inflated for future use . Chimney balloons come in lots of different sizes to ensure you get a snug fit within the chimney , helping to keep draughts at a minimum . They are also really simple to fit . As a rough guide , a chimney balloon will cost you approximately -25 give or take a few pounds depending on the size you buy , and you can also buy a handgrip extension kit -5-10 to help inflate the chimney balloon when it is out of normal reach . <h> Can you draught proof a chimney with anything else ? <p> You can obviously opt to draught proof your chimney by simply stuffing plastic bags up it the issue with this is twofold . Firstly , if you forget it is there and light the fire , you can actually cause a chimney fire . The second is that it will be far more difficult to ensure that you are stopping all the draughts . We have also come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past which again as flammable materials are a really bad idea . If you were to forget the chimney balloon was up the chimney when you light the fire , it would simply wilt and fall from the chimney but it would not cause a fire hence from a safety point of view , this is why we always advise them ! <p> Chimney cowls are also a great way of ensuring maximum efficiency while also keeping out nesting birds and debris . <h> Draught Proofing Loft Hatches <h> Insulation <h> Why should I insulate my loft hatch ? <p> Your loft hatch can cause cold draughts to enter the living space of your home , - especially if you have a cold loft space ( i.e. insulated at joist level rather than rafter level ) . <p> Draught-proofing the loft hatch should be done at the same time as insulating the loft space to ensure you gain the maximum savings on your energy bills . <h> How to draught-proof a loft hatch <p> First of all : be careful . If you intend to insulate the loft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take safety seriously . You must take care whenever you work up a ladder and if you feel unsafe or not entirely comfortable undertaking this then please use a certified installer . <p> There tend to be two types of loft hatch : <p> The hatch rests on the frame of the loft entrance . <p> The loft hatch is hinged and will swing down when opened . <p> To draught-proof the first of these , you can simply put a compression seal or foam strip around the perimeter of the bottom of the loft hatch . When the hatch sits in place , the seal should ensure that all draughts are stopped . <p> If the loft hatch is hinged , you will need to put either the compression seal or the foam strip on the outside perimeter on the top of loft hatch . You will also need to put an equivalent strip on the inside of the hatch frame so that the two strips meet , creating an airtight barrier to stop the draughts . <h> Insulating the top of your loft hatch <p> Once you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatch , creating a seal to stop cold air entering the main house and hot air escaping , it is also worth insulating the top of the loft hatch as a final step . <p> This is fairly simple process ; essentially you just need to attach the insulating to the top of the loft hatch . Quite a neat way of doing this is gluing a plastic carrier bag to the top of the loft hatch ( covering as much of the loft hatch as you can without going over any of the edges . You can then stuff the bag with insulating wool and tape it closed . Sealing the insulation within the bag prevents fibres coming apart when you open the loft hatch , so you can avoid breathing them in or getting them on your skin . <h> Draught Proofing Cracks <h> Insulation <h> Where should I look for cracks ? <p> On old walls <p> Around installed appliances <p> Areas of pipe or cable fittings <h> How- to draught proof cracks <p> Older properties tend to have a few visible cracks in their walls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advise booking an appointment with a building surveyor to ensure the structural integrity of the building <p> If they are small and do n't pose any structural threat then you can fill them to stop draughts , which will help improve the energy efficiency and thermal comfort of the property . While the amount of heat loss that may occur through these cracks is relatively small compared with that of windows and doors , the ease in which they can be draught-proofed makes them a popular focus . <p> Cracks can change size , depending on seasonal changes or shifting pressures on the structure . This means they- need to be filled using flexible filler products that allow for a certain level of movement if you just use Polyfilla , the crack will reopen . <p> If its a crack that will stay at a- constant width , rigid filler provides a smoother , more professional finish and effectively removes any draught that may have been present previously . Once the crack is filled and the filler has dried , it can be sanded down and painted to match the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaps , foam-based filler products should be used . This foam expands once it is squeezed into the crack , creating an airtight seal . Once the foam has set solid it can be sanded down and painted to match the surrounding area . It is difficult to get the same level of professional finish as with a- rigid filler . <p> The first step is to identify which type of floor you have . You can find out by pulling up the corner of your carpet , or looking for air bricks on the outside of the property at the bottom of the walls " these will signify a suspended timber floor . <h> Where to look for draughts : <p> In between floorboards <p> Around skirting boards <h> How do I draught-proof floorboards ? <p> The gaps in between stripped floorboards may add up to the size of a small window ; therefore draught-proofing your floor is essential and can she 'd pounds from your energy bill , paying for itself in less than 12 months . With so many products on the market , it is important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your specific requirements . <p> The first thing to assess when considering whether to draught-proof your floorboards is what the required finish is . For example the methods used to draught-proof floorboards under a carpet are different to those used to draught-proof stripped floorboards . It should be noted that even though carpet will help with draught-proofing , it is not 100% effective , and additional measures can still help . <h> How do I draught-proof stripped floorboards ? <p> There are many products that fill the gaps between the floorboards , helping to prevent draughts . These come in the form of tube-like rolls ( such as DraughtEx ) that are easily pushed into the spaces between floorboards , assuming- that the correct and accurate diameters have previously been taken into account . This is a quick , easy and relatively cheap way of draught-proofing your floorboards effectively . However , difficulties may arise if you have an older floor with uneven gaps between the floorboards that may require you to buy additional rolls of different sizes . <p> Alternatives to the tube-like rolls , which are pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic lengths that spring apart when pushed into place using a credit card . When in position , this innovative method is invisible and effectively stops draughts . The issue here is that if they pop out they could then potentially trip you up ; make sure they are fitted as per the instructions to prevent this from happening . <p> Using thicker underlay below the carpet is also an effective way to stop the draughts and insulate the floorboards . <p> The most effective way to stop draughts coming up through the floorboards is unfortunately also the most costly and time consuming . This involves lifting up the floorboards and applying insulation between the joists " details of how to do this can be found on our ffloor insulation- pages . <h> How do I draught-proof the skirting board ? <p> Even with successfully draught-proofed floorboards , you may still lose heat through the skirting- board area .

The wooden beadings come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap that allows draughts . <p> Draught-proofing this area may also be achieved through silicone-based gunned sealants that can equally block the gap between the floor and the wall ; again you may need to use a combination of both the wooden beadings and the sealant if the gaps between the floor and the skirting board are particularly large . <h> Draught proofing windows <h> Do my windows- need draught-proofing ? <p> Not all windows need to be draught-proofed . Double or triple glazed windows installed since 2002 should be sufficiently well-built and installed so as not to require any . Older double glazing and single glazed windows can be draught-proofed , however . If you are unsure on the age of your double glazing , you should check for either a FENSA certificate , which you will have received with any windows installed since 2002 , or a stamp in the metal seal of the window . <h> Where to look for draughts <p> The gaps between the window and the frame <p> Caulk on the outside of the window frame <p> The area around any locks or catches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of one window is not equal to that of an external door , the accumulated draught from every window in your house can account for huge amounts of energy loss . Therefore it is crucial to draught-proof these areas . In order to complete a successful draught-proofing of a window , you must firstly pinpoint the gaps that require work . After locating the area that requires draught-proofing , there are a few methods to consider . <h> How can I draught-proof my windows ? <h> How should I draught-proof a window that opens ? <p> Firstly , compression seals provide a professional finish and prevent- draughts , as well as dust and moisture entering the home . The seals are sometimes held by metal , plastic or wooden carriers , which are fixed onto the frames through pre-drilled fixing holes . This maintains the memory ' or bounce-back-ability ' of the seal , enabling it to return to its original shape even after periods of crushing , due to normal everyday use of the window . The carrier is cut to length and must be less than 25mm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items such as clothing . However they may also be glued to the frame . While these compression seals , as well as the similar tubular seals , provide excellent performance on narrow window gaps , they are not the best option when draught-proofing sash windows on larger properties . <h> How should I draught-proof a window that does n't open ? <p> The best method for draught-proofing a window that does not open is a silicone-based sealant . After the gaps in the framework have been located and cleaned to remove any dust that may reduce the longevity of the draught-proofing method , a gunned silicone sealant can be easily applied . This is a cheap and easy way to DIY draught proof . <h> How should I draught-proof a sash window ? <p> If you are looking to draught-proof a sash window or if the gaps between the window and its frame are not consistent due to seasonal changes , brush strips may provide the best solution . While mainly used in the draught-proofing of doors , it is not rare to see this method around larger windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrier , which is pinned onto the frame . While they may be painted to reduce their visibility , this does decrease their efficiency . However the brushes or blades may be contained using wooden carriers , which may provide a more aesthetically-pleasing- solution to window draughts . <p> Another method of draught-proofing your window , and common when taking the DIY approach , is low-friction seals in loose strips or carriers . This solution involves the rubbing of wipers or blades , which are fixed onto the frame , against the closing window . While they may also be fixed using an adhesive-based foam strip , this method ( although cheap ) does not comply with British standards and is therefore not recommended . <h> Using gunned silicone as a sealant <p> A DIY-friendly and relatively cheap solution to your window draught-proofing needs is gap-filling seals with- gunned silicone sealant . In order to ensure that maximum draught-proofing is achieved , you must cover the part of the window that comes into contact with the frame in a release agent . This prevents the sealant from sticking to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then shut to provide a temporary mould for the sealant before it sets . While it provides an efficient solution to the draught-proofing issue , if it is n't carried out correctly , the result may look untidy . <h> Installing new windows map . 184568 @qwx384568 <p> Need new windows ? <p> Fill in your details and we 'll be in touch ! 184572 @qwx384572 184569 @qwx384569 184566 @qwx384566 <h> Draught Proofing Doors <h> Insulation <h> Where should I look for draughts ? <p> Around the door frame <p> The keyhole <p> The letterbox <p> Obviously draught proofing external doors should be the priority , since this will stop cold outside air entering the property ; but doors that separate cold rooms from warm rooms should also be draught-proofed to prevent the unwanted circulation of air between the two . This maybe the case if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the winter to help save on your energy bills . <h> How can I draught-proof around the door frame ? <p> The first step is to fit a brush strip to the bottom of the doorframe , as this is where the largest gap tends to be between the door and the frame . Most draught excluders are screwed in place , so first you need to measure the length of the bottom of the door . It is important to measure the door when it is closed , as the fixed brush strip may otherwise stop the door shutting . The brush strip then needs to be cut to length using a hacksaw . Once it has been cut to length , screw the brush strip in place , ensuring that the bristles of the brush reach the floor as this is what is going to stop the draughts . <p> A hinged flap draught excluder may also be used as it works on a similar principle ; however instead of brushes this method relies on a flexible strip to prevent draughts . <p> Around the sides and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strip or brush strips to minimise draughts . The foam strips tend to come attached with a self-adhesive surface , so prior to fitting them to the door , you need to clean the door surface with soapy water ( and let it dry ) to ensure the foam strip sticks properly . <p> The brush strips tend to be a lot smaller than those used at the bottom of the door , so again they tend to come with a self-adhesive surface to stick them to the door , but in some cases you will be required to screw them in place . The pre-drilled holes that attach the brush strips to the door do not hinder the memory ' or bounce-back-ability ' of the seal . This enables it to return to its original shape , even after periods of heavy door usage . <p> Gunned silicone sealant may also be used in the draught proofing of doors .

These draughts are easily prevented by installing an- escutcheon plate ( essentially a metal disc that is attached at the top of the key hole ) . - This will swing open allowing you to insert the key and swing shut again to stop draughts . <h> How can I draught proof letterboxes ? <p> Standard letterboxes produce a surprisingly large draught . We recommend installing something like the Ecoflap letterbox as it is 100% effective , easy to install and is low cost . It- is a simple method of draught proofing and completely stops any potential heat loss through the letterbox .

@@36749112 @5749112/ <h> Ground Source Heat Pumps <h> Heating <h> What are ground source heat pumps ? <p> Ground source heat pumps- use- the earth as a heat source , taking- advantage of the stable- temperatures in the ground- to provide heat and hot water for the home . <p> Ground source heat pumps are not a new concept and have been around since the 19th century . This technology became very popular in Sweden in the 1970s and since then units have been sold worldwide . <p> In the UK , there has been a sudden surge in demand in heat pumps since the launch of the Renewable Heat Incentive , which pays homeowners for each unit of hot water produced . Although rates are no longer as high as they were , they can still cover much of the initial install costs of the systems . <h> How do ground source heat pumps work ? <p> A ground source heat pump system uses heat trapped beneath the ground- and boosts it to a higher temperature using a heat pump . This heat is then used to provide home heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role as a boiler does in a central heating system , but uses ambient heat from the ground rather than burning fuel to generate heat . <p> Initially , a heat transfer liquid- ( normally glycol ) is pumped through pipes buried deep in the ground . As the liquid- travels through the pipework it absorbs ambient heat from the ground- and warms up , before returning back to the ground source heat pump unit . Once it returns , a heat exchanger removes the heat from the liquid and it then continues to travel round and round the pipework in a continuous cycle . <p> The low-grade heat is transferred through the heat exchanger , then passes through a heat pump compressor which drives the temperature up to a level that is usable for heating and hot water . <h> How much pipework does a GSHP require ? <p> The length of the ground loop depends on the size of your home and the amount of heat you need longer loops can draw more heat from the ground , but need more space to be buried in . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If laid horizontally , the pipework tends to be buried in trenches 2-3m deep , spread over- a huge surface area to ensure the heat transfer liquid has the opportunity to increase to a sufficient temperature . If the pipework is installed vertically , boreholes get drilled in to ground ( at a cost of -6,000 -8,000 for each borehole ! ) . These need to be drilled by professionals and will regularly exceed 100m in depth to ensure that the heat transfer liquid again has the opportunity to absorb enough heat . <p> There are two types of ground source heat pump , and both- have a few components in common they- consist of a ground heat exchanger , a heat pump and a heat distribution system ( e.g. underfloor heating or radiators ) . <h> Closed loop ground source heat pump <p> The majority of ground source heat pumps installed today are closed loop heat pumps. - As the name suggests , no outside- liquid enters the loop of pipework at any point . In this set up , a sealed loop of high density polyethylene pipe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat transfer- fluid is in a completely closed system travelling through the pipework and returning back to heat pump . <h> Open loop ground source heat pump <p> The open-loop ground source heat pump uses ground water to pump around the system ; however the number of- installations of this type are decreasing , mainly- because- you need a source of groundwater . Also an additional- associated issue with the- open loop ground source heat pump- is that- the quality of the groundwater can actually have a- detrimental- effect on- the system . <h> Ground source heat pumps require electricity <p> The fact- that ground source heat pumps run on electricity suggests that they are expensive to run ( electricity is approximately 15p / kWh while gas is just 4p / kWh ) . However heat pumps are in fact incredibly efficient . <p> In fact , ground source heat pumps are even more efficient than air source heat pumps , converting each unit of electricity ( required to run the pump and compressor ) into 3.5 4.5 units of useful heat . Compare this to a brand new energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just 0.9 units of useful heat . <p> The efficiency of air source heat pumps is measured by the Coefficient of Performance ( CoP ) , which is simply how many units of useful energy are produced from each unit of electricity consumed to operate the system . With air source heat pumps , the coefficient of performance changes throughout the year . This is because since in the winter months , the unit needs to work harder ( and hence uses more electricity ) to drive the temperature up to an acceptable temperature . <p> For ground source heat pumps the coefficient of performance is relatively consistent this means that even in the middle of winter , when hot water and heating demand are at a maximum , the GSHP should be running equally as efficiently as it does on a red hot summers day . This is because the temperature underneath the ground- remains relatively constant all year round and this is one of the key advantages of GSHPs over air source heat pumps . <p> Heat pumps do have some impact on the environment as they require- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground is constantly being renewed naturally , hence they are considered a renewable heating source . <h> Installing a ground source heat pump <p> The- Energy Saving Trust ( EST ) recommends households considering a ground source heat pump to consult a Microgeneration Certification Scheme installer and only use a properly accredited professional to complete the work . During its trial , the EST found- a variety of heat pumps incorrectly installed , which therefore did n't perform as efficiently overall as they could have . It is essential to use an- MCS-approved installer to qualify for the- Renewable Heat Incentive . <p> It is important to shop around and we always recommend getting several quotes before choosing the best option for you . Studies have shown that most suppliers tend to exaggerate the savings in energy costs this system will produce . <h> Renewable Heat Incentive <p> Heat pumps are part of the Government- Renewable Heat Incentive- ( RHI ) scheme . It means that you can get paid for every unit of renewable- heat you generate . You- can- get a significant chunk of the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the savings to be made from the heat pump itself . Read more on that here . <h> Benefits <p> Ground source heat pumps can lower fuel bills , especially if you are currently using conventional electric heating ( saving of -420 ) , LPG or oil ( saving of -50 ) . <p> Ground source heat pumps are often classed as a fit and forget ' technology because they need little maintenance , and no fuel deliveries are required , however they provide space heating and hot water 24/7. 184564 @qwx384564 <p> Ground source heat pumps require a reasonable amount of land outside to lay the coils underground .

I am after a ground source heat pump system that works ! Do n't  want it too fancy so I am in two minds about Nibe or the Dimplex . Now , the house we live in has a fairly large garden and I am sure we can have a trench in there as well as a borehole . However , having read various forums , I have seen that most people go for the borehole as their solution . Not too worried about the cost as we were looking to have internal refurbishment and installing underfloor heating with the system . Would you recommend anything else before we embark on this journey ? <p> I 've had a geothermal ground source pump installed to my 2nd home last year . It was working fine up until last week when we simply could n't turn off the hot water . Do you know if they are typically on a timer or switch or thermostat ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then they may well have gone into administration . What would you advise ? <p> Ive been following your blogs for a long time . My wofe and I would now like to explore changing our heating system to a ground source heat pump with underfloor heating . Can someone explain to me how it all works with the green deal and the renewable heat incentive which you call rhi . <p> I have to say I am on abit of a crusade at the moment . I got a ground source heat pump fitted 8 years ago and it cost just over -4,000 . It was ok for several years but last winter it broke down and I was told it would cost about -13,000 to replace the unit . <p> Either I got a great deal or people are getting ripped off for heat pumps these days . I 'm going to go with the latter . What do you say to that then GreenAge ? <p> Hi Jim , We had a very similar call just last week on this one I think to be honest you got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the cost of a ground source heat pump and the price of the unit itself ( pre install ) is -14k inc vat this is a Dimplex one on the plumb centre website . <p> I do n't  though think people are getting ripped off nowadays much of the initial outlay comes back to the homeowner in the form of the RHI . The beauty of heat pumps is that they are actually very simple bits of kit . So the heat pump unit itself should just last 25 years plus ( far longer than a boiler ) . <p> I do n't  know how you can charge -14K for a simple bit of kit ? How does that work ? If its that simple it should be the same price as a boiler ! Can you tell me what the cheapest heat pump unit on the market is ? <p> The RHI is all very good but it does n't  really help with the cost up front . Not sure where I 'm going to find 13,000 from at the moment . Good job i don ; t need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a second mortgage . <p> Hi Jim , thanks again for the comment . The -14k does include everything required for the heat pump to operate including a hot water tank . Vaillant GeoTherm 10Kw Ground Source Heat Pump is -6.5k to buy , but that does n't  include anything else it is just the ground source heat pump unit . To be honest , I would go for a well known make since it will likely last longer than simply going for the cheapest model . <p> In terms of the RHI indeed it does n't  help with the up front cost of the heat pump sadly We have spoken to the Government team responsible for setting up the scheme , it was simply designed to help increase uptake of renewable energy ( i.e. make it more attractive ) . That was the brief from the Labour Government at the time , rather than helping a certain part of society benefit . <p> I would like to install a ground source heat pump in Harrow , North West London . We have a 800ft by 200ft garden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know if there are any planning restrictions that would prevent us installing a ground source heat pump in a fairly urbanised area. ? <p> I am interested in getting a ground source heat pump . We are off mains gas and we have a large field out the back of our home which I feel would house the pipework necessary . Does the pipework need to be a certain length to ensure the water warms up a sufficient temperature ? i.e every 100m will cause the water to increase by 0.1 centigrade ? Does such a formula exist as I get that would be useful to work out hope much pipe we need to lay for the ground source heat pump as I think we could save considerably on the install cost if we do this part ourselves and get the MCS installer to install the actual heat pump . <p> My friend had a ground source heat pump installed on her property and the bore holes they drilled caved in in leaving her with an overall cost significantly higher than the starting quote . Does this happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heat pump has been installed they have been happy with it , however for us the outlay is very high so I just want to know whether they were unlucky or this is quite a common issue ? <p> Hi Xavier , Normally if boreholes are being drilled as part of the ground source heat pump install , then the drilling company will offer a certain length of collaring e.g. 10m or 20m . This means that if they go through a particularly soft area of earth they can reinforce it with a collar to ensure it does n't  collapse . The issue of course is that despite looking at the bedrock before drilling it is very difficult to know how much of the drilled borehole will require a reinforcing collar . I would suggest trying to establish / agreeing a cost for the additional collaring prior to getting the ground source heat pump bore holes drilled so if you do need additional collars then you know what the cost will be .

@@36749115 @5749115/ <h> Suspended floors vs solid floors <h> June 6 , 2017 <p> There are two basic ways to make the floors of a building . You can either have a concrete base or a suspended floor , usually made out of timber . There are various pros and cons to these types of floor , some of which impact on the energy efficiency of the building and how you go about insulating them . In this blog , we are going to look at some of the implications of this type of house . <h> Why do houses have timber floors ? <p> Timber floors were originally designed to prevent damp . Raising the floor level up above the ground acts as a barrier to damp coming up from the ground . Unfortunately , a consequence of this is that the floors can be quite draughty , with air bricks required- to keep the timber dry . <p> These days most homes are designed with concrete floors because damp proofing technology allows us to create a dry floor without an air gap . There are- still be many suspended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive and often impractical . <h> How to insulate suspended timber floors <p> There are a few ways to insulate a suspended floor , but the best , most breathable way is to hang insulation under the floorboards . This insulates the floor , but still allows some air to circulate , preventing the timber from getting damp and rotting . You can also insulate from above using a similar method to a concrete floor , but a breathable insulation must be used along with a breathable membrane to ensure that the timber can breathe . <h> How to insulate solid floors <p> It is not possible to lay insulation underneath a solid floor , so any insulation will need to go on top . It is better to install the insulation during the building of the property because any retrofit is likely to cause issues with doorways and fixtures and fittings in the property . Standard rigid board insulation is typically laid on top of the floor , with new flooring add above this . Laying the insulation is cheap , but the costs soon stack up if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted cupboards , radiators and other parts of the home . Insulation is usually added only during major refurbishment work . <h> Insulating intermediate floors <p> We often get asked whether you should insulate floors between levels , as well as the ground floor . The answer to this is that it really depends on the reason for insulating . If you are doing it to improve the energy efficiency only , then intermediate level insulation will not have any value . Because both the upstairs and downstairs are being heated , there is no heat transfer between levels and therefore no energy saving to be made . There are a couple of good reasons for insulating like this however : The insulation will act as a sound barrier helping to prevent noise travelling across the home .

@@36749116 @5749116/ <h> Why a Gas Safety certificate is not just a piece of paper <h> September 15 , 2016 <p> A Gas Safety certificate is a legal requirement for all rental properties in the UK where there are gas appliances present. - If you live in a rented home , it is the landlords responsibility to get a certificate , - but if you own your own home you should consider getting one yourself . <p> Early Autumn- is the best time to get a Gas Safety certificate , before you feel the need to switch on your heating and while competition for installers is low . The check ensures that all your appliances are working as they should and that there is adequate ventilation . Carbon monoxide can kill pretty quickly , and as its invisible and odourless , it can be difficult to detect . Therefore- its really important to check appliances are not leaking gas . Aside from providing peace of mind , there are other reasons to make sure you get a certificate- regularly . <h> Why get a Gas Safety certificate ? <p> Landlords <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get a certificate- yearly for all pipe work , gas appliances and flues in your property . Without this , - you will not be allowed to lease the property and could be fined up to -6000 ( or even face prison ) . Legally , those with lodgers or even exchange students also come under this remit . If you 're not sure whether you have to get one or not , you can check here . <p> Landlords are not responsible for ensuring the safety of gas appliances separately owned by tenants . <p> Homeowners <p> If you own your own home/gas appliances , a Gas Safety certificate is n't mandatory , but you may want to get one nonetheless , for a number of reasons : <p> To ensure the safety of those in your home . <p> It may be a requirement of your insurance . <p> The long-term manufacturer warranty of some appliances might stipulate that you need- a Gas Safety check annually . <h> How much does a Gas Safety certificate cost ? <p> Depending on what part of the country you 're in , Gas-safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and around -10 for any additional appliances . <p> It may be worth ringing around- to- check the quote you 've been given is reasonable . <h> What does an inspection involve ? <p> A Gas Safe registered engineer will come to your house and inspect gas pipework , gas cookers , gas boilers , gas fires and gas water heaters . They will check for the following : <p> Gas tightness of appliances <p> Whether there is adequate ventilation <p> Safety brackets <p> Flue flow <p> All flame failure devices will be checked for satisfactory operation . <p> Presence and effectiveness of stability brackets . <p> The engineer sends your landlord a record of what was checked and any problems found . If there are any serious problems with gas appliances , the engineer must make them safe . This could involve- disconnecting faulty equipment and arranging for your gas supply to be cut off . <p> The whole process should only take around an hour and will keep those in your home safe ! <h> 2 comments <p> great information sharing for gas safety certificates . as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for landlords but one thing in blog is confusing to me. that is the cost of gas safety certificate . you mentioned cost around -50 for 3 appliances , and around -10 for any additional appliances . Is it annual cost or need to get gas certificate only once in a life ? <p> A gas safety certificate is an annual requirement . Generally I would say that the more appliances you have the more it costs to get the certificate . A gas fire for example can take more time in conjunction with a boiler and -50 just is n't feasible financially for almost twice the work . This in part why some long term landlords and letting someone prefer installing electric hobs , cookers and fires in order to reduce the subsequent annual costs and risk to life .

From door-knocking , to window offers too good to be true , it is difficult to know whom to trust and as importantly it is difficult to gauge whether you are in fact getting- a good deal . <h> How much should new double glazed windows cost ? <p> The first thing is that you should have a very approximate figure in your head so you have something to compare against . <p> So to give you a helping hand , we reckon an average sized uPVC sash window will cost about -700 to buy and install . A wooden sash window will cost about -1,400 again to install and fit . If you want a simpler double glazed uPVC window the price can be as low as -400 per unit . <h> We would always recommend getting windows installed professionally <p> We know there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a daily basis , but to fit a double glazed unit is not easy . Please pay for a professional to do this " not only will they do it correctly , they will also be liable if anything goes wrong ! <h> How to pick the best Window installer <p> It is difficult to avoid double-glazing advertising on the TV or radio , with promises of massive energy savings and -+ price windows ( indefinitely it seems ) , but in terms of picking an installer the first thing is to make sure they are either FENSA or CERTASS certified . If the window installer- does n't fall under one of these two bodies " look elsewhere . That is our number 1 piece of advice ! <p> Be aware that if you go with one of the big boys Everest , Anglian , Safestyle , you are going to be paying more for your windows . That is not to say they are bad " in fact they are very good , but they can get away with charging more to install your new windows . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job and cost far less that the larger double-glazing installers , but we would suggest checking them out before going with them . That involves making sure they have been in the business for a while ( we recommend 10 years or more ) , but we also appreciate that new companies do form and they need to be given a chance . Getting recommendations from friends and family is also a sensible way to go , invariably if they had a good service , then you should get the same . It is also worth seeing some of their work , so ask them for some references and see if you can visit any local properties to see the windows that have been installed to see you are happy with the finished look . <h> Do n't sign up to anything straight away ! <p> One of the key selling techniques of a double-glazing company will be to try and get you to sign up to their offer by the time they leave the house . This will require you paying a huge deposit to secure the deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Get the salesman to leave the property and then let them know you will get in touch when you have made your decision . We really would n't recommend paying any more than a 30% deposit too " so if they are pushing for more , tell them you will look elsewhere . <p> In the end you want to be sure you are getting good quality windows at reasonable value . Make sure you get multiple quotes for any double-glazing you are considering , definitely do n't go with the first company that you get to come round ! <h> 8 comments <p> Good post . Both choosing the right window as well as the best installer is a difficult task . I have experienced that while renovating my home . Finally I got the help of Clera Windows , Canada .

The reason for this is that when they are burnt in the biomass boiler , the release of carbon dioxide only amounts to the same level they absorbed as plants/trees while they were growing . <p> Using this reasoning , one could argue that coal and gas are also renewable since they were once biological material " however it is really a question of timescale . Coal might take millions of years to form , while biomass fuels can take just a couple of years . <h> Fuel formats <p> Fuels generally need to be processed to be useful " some typical formats are : <p> Logs " Commonly found in domestic to light commercial with daily input required . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our near farms for ease of transport . <h> Types of biomass fuel <p> Fuels can be seen as either wet or dry and high or low density . Wetter fuels will have a lower calorific value ( i.e. less energy per kilo of fuel ) and will be cheaper , but some moisture is usually desirable as some boilers do n't run as well with very dry fuel . Density is fairly straight forward denser fuels will take up less space , but can be more expensive . Calorific value is also important , as some fuels will be dense but produce less energy than a less dense fuel with higher calorific content . The best measure of a fuel 's energy is Energy Density by Volume ' or kWh/m3 . This allows easy comparison between fuel types . <p> Virgin Wood " This includes any wood untreated with chemicals and finishes .

Using virgin wood it is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have repercussions for any environmental permits . <p> Energy Crops This is not a big market in the UK but typically it involves short rotation crops , and could use any number of plants from fast growing trees like poplar to sugar and starch crops ( beet , wheat or maize ) , to oil crops like rape and sunflower . Whatever the source , the fuel typically comes in a processed chipped form . With these fuels it is important to know whether the boiler is suitable for use with them . <p> Agricultural Residues " These systems typically require daily user input which can be a turn off for some , but for those with easy access to waste materials like wheat or barley straw , they can offer a very price competitive option . <p> Food Residues " Typically wet and can come from almost any food manufacturer in the form of oils , fruit and vegetables , distillery waste , and waste meat and fish . <p> Industrial Residues " This can include treated and untreated wood residues , like sawdust or dry wood chip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the fuel must comply with environmental regulations . You must also be careful with the use of extremely dry materials as these can adversely affect a boiler that is not designed for use with the fuel . <h> Most popular types of biomass fuels <p> The two most common types of biomass fuel are wood pellets and wood chips . <h> Biomass wood pellets <p> These wood pellets are normally about 10mm x 30mm in size and are manufactured from waste wood products . These compacted offcuts ( from saw milling , wood manufactured products and waste wood found after logging ) , are compressed down into pellets along with a binding agent , often flour or corn starch , to prevent the breakup of individual pellets . <p> The pellets can be delivered in tankers ( if demand is high ) .

Debarked logs are fed into specialised wood chipping machines , a less complex procedure than the manufacturing of pellets , and less manual handling that logs . <p> Due to their relatively high moisture content they do not tend to be as efficient in terms of transportation and storage as wood pellets , with 1 tonne of wood chips taking up a space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly used for boilers of a medium to large installation size .

After a tree is initially chopped , minimal processing is required and they are extremely easy to transport . <p> However , due to the minimal surface area of the logs , and their high moisture content , they have a much lower calorific value compared to either wood chips or biomass wood pellets .

Instead , the user will need to put the logs in the burners by hand , which means that they are far more maintenance-heavy . <p> Despite their lower calorific value and the fact they are more awkward to handle , wood logs do tend to be very popular and are used across the UK to power a variety of stoves that heat individual rooms or biomass boilers that heat both the home and the water system .

You only need- to travel as far as Canary Wharf to see some of the most modern commercial buildings in the world and all these are serviced by efficient and highly integrated air-conditioning systems . The HVAC systems were an integral part of the buildings design and as such they are incredibly efficient and work in perfect harmony with the building . <p> However , if you travel to some of the older commercial areas like in east London or Acton you will find 100 year old warehouses that has had air-conditioning installed many years after the initial premises was built while effective at heating and cooling the premises , these HVAC systems will in many cases not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is your building serviced by air-conditioning ? Do you help someone to control air-conditioning or are you responsible for operating the system ? If the answer is yes to those questions then this article may be of interest to you . <p> Did you know ? If your building is serviced by air-conditioning and the combined output is more than 12kW then it will have to have an air-conditioning inspection carried out by a qualified energy assessor . <h> What is an air-conditioning system ? <p> An air conditioning system is defined as a combination of all components required to provide a form of air treatment in which the temperature is controlled , or can be lowered , and includes systems which combine such air treatment with the control of ventilation , humidity and air cleanliness ' . <h> Why do we require an air-conditioning inspection ? <p> The whole point of having an air-conditioning inspection is that it should help improve and raise the awareness of the energy efficiency of the existing system . By identifying the issues , it should enable the person responsible for operating the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the energy efficiency ; reduce energy consumption , operating costs and the overall carbon emissions . <p> For example , the air-conditioning inspection may flag up that the refrigerant in the unit is stopping the system from working efficiently . However legislation already prohibits replacement of the refrigerant in the older units , and this will therefore incentivise the owners to replace them with much more energy efficient systems . <p> Air-conditioning units like all systems need to be kept cleaned and maintained so they operate at a high standard . As these systems usually service areas that hold a high number of people , e.g. office spaces or workshops , they have to be able to provide a healthy and comfortable environment . Refrigerant gases could be quite unpleasant , so it is imperative that they are stopped from escaping into that working environment and the equipment carries on working safely . <h> When were air-conditioning inspections introduced to the UK ? <p> The Energy Performance Building Directive ( EPBD ) was introduced in 2002 , which introduced a series of legislation designed to help improve the energy efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Different components of the legislation were phased in over the years and by 2009 a lot of the larger systems had to have the inspection by this date . By 2013 , all the buildings that had an air-conditioning output more than 12kWs had to have a valid inspection take place . <p> It is important to note that any individual or team responsible for the upkeep of the air-conditioning systems must make sure that the inspections are no more than 5 years apart . <h> When are air-conditioning inspections required ? <p> Only air-conditioning systems that have a combined output of 12kWs or more require an air-conditioning inspection . For example you may have individual units that go well under this calorific value , but when combined this may take the total output well above the 12kWs , therefore triggering the requirement to have the inspection take place . <p> The regulations stipulate that a building has a roof construction and walls for which energy is used to create an indoor climate .

Air-conditioning units that provide cooling to process applications such as server rooms should also be surveyed if accessible . Other mechanical ventilation systems that do n't provide cooling themselves but actually service an area that is cooled should be included as well . <p> If the air-conditioning system only provides heating to an indoor climate then the building or self-contained unit is exempt from the assessment . <h> Methodology behind the air-conditioning inspections <p> When the EPBB guidelines were introduced , the TM44 paper was produced by CIBSE ( Chartered Institute for Building Service Engineers ) to help produce a methodology to satisfy the requirements of the Directive . <p> The TM44 report also provides guidance on carrying out the required air-conditioning inspections taking into consideration variables such as time , cost and skill set required from the assessor . The focus is on systems that use refrigerants to produce cooling . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other forms of cooling systems , such as those that use pipes or ducts built into the fabric of the building ( e.g. cooled deck or ceiling slabs ) , or those which use aquifers or local water sources to provide cooling solutions . <h> What does the air-conditioning report contain ? <p> The inspection report must include an assessment of the efficiency of the system and its size compared to the cooling requirements of the building . It must also contain appropriate advice on possible improvements to the system " more discussed on this in the next section . <p> The inspection report must include the following key information : <p> the address of the building in which the system is located ; <p> the name of the accredited air conditioning energy assessor <p> assessor 's address ( if self-employed ) or name and address of employer <p> the date on which the inspection occurred <p> accreditation scheme number as well as the name of the Government approved certification body <p> - <h> What will be discussed in the report ? <p> The air-conditioning should make references to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and any suggestions made for improvement ; <p> any faults identified during the inspection and suggested actions ; <p> the adequacy of equipment maintenance and any suggestions for improvement ; <p> the adequacy of the installed controls and control settings and any suggestions made for improvement ; <p> the current size of the installed system in relation to the cooling load any suggestions for improvement ; <p> summary of the findings and the key recommendations . <p> Bear in mind the air-conditioning certificate is designed to inform the building owner or the manager about the energy efficiency of the system as well as ways to operate it more efficiently and reduce the operating costs . The report will identify opportunities for the owner to make the improvements to the system " they are not binding and do not have to be put in place , but the owners or the managers may want to if it makes economic , environmental and operating sense to do so . <p> The report may flag for instance that the heating and cooling of the building is not working effectively in tandem , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the operating costs . <p> Assessors can also comment on basic maintenance , such as cleaning or repairs , to equipment whose efficiency has evidently suffered through neglect .

The building owner or manager should also be provided with advice on how to keep simple ongoing management of the system . <p> Some systems are very well maintained and all the maintenance works as well as the operating manuals are well documented . In these cases the assessor should n't dwell too much on the improvement reporting and try to keep the inspection a much more streamlined process . <h> What does the air-conditioning inspection process entail ? <p> The inspection process should examine refrigerant equipment and all air moving systems , as well as the associated controls that form part of the air-conditioning system .

The power station was completed 5 years later and was opened on 18th- October 1950 by the late Queen Mother . Even today it is still the largest conventional- hydroelectric power- plant in the UK . The- Loch Sloy Dam , built as part of the project , is 56m high and 357m long and raised the surface level of the loch by approximately 47m . The resulting Sloy Reservoir has a 17km2- direct catchment area , although various pipes and intakes have provided a further 63km2- of indirect catchment area . The total volume of water held in the reservoir by the dam is approaching 36million m2 , and the potential energy contained within this mass of water is equivalent to 14million kWh of useful electrical energy . A 3km long tunnel takes water from Loch Sloy to a valve house positioned approximately 197m above the tank . From the valve house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerhouse that is situated on the west coast of Loch Lomond . <h> Extending the Sloy Hydroelectric Power Plant <p> When the plant was initially built , a vertical Francis turbines was installed in each pump and these were rated at 32MW giving the plant a total output capacity of 128MW , however in the late 1990s a -113m refurbishment resulted in three of the turbines being replaced with larger 40MW turbines . As a result of this refurbishment , the total output of the plant- now stands at- 152MW . In Sept 2010 , - Scottish &amp; Southern Energy- was given planning permission to extend the Sloy Hydroelectric Power Plant by installing a pumping station , which will give the plant pumped storage capability . The proposed pumping station will house two 30MW pumps each capable of pumping 10m3- / second of water . These would be adjoined to two of the existing pipes , allowing water to be pumped back from the powerhouse on- Loch Lomond- all the way to Loch Sloy .

It was with great sadness that we all witnessed the events at Grenfell Tower , in North West London " our deepest sympathies are with all those involved . <p> It is clear that much of the media have already begun to blame the rainscreen cladding system as a contributing factor to the accelerated spread of the fire . Obviously , a full investigation will have to take place before we know for sure , but it certainly looks like this may have been the case . <p> We feel it is important to educate people on this type of cladding system . Rainscreen cladding is a solution that is primarily designed to protect a building from the elements . It tends to be made up of a protective , decorative outer coat attached to the underlying structure of the building by a supporting grid ( metal frame in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the building structure is often used to house insulation materials , but also it maintains a ventilated cavity , and aids draining . The cavity between the insulation and the protective cladding is normally a minimum of 25mm . <p> These rainscreen cladding systems can be either retrofitted to existing buildings or incorporated into new builds . <p> Often rainscreen systems are hybrid systems based on architects requirements to improve both the look and thermal performance of a building . They therefore take advantage of materials from different companies to provide the desired effect . <h> External Wall Insulation ( EWI ) is not rainscreen cladding <p> External wall insulation on properties is very different " in the majority of cases this is retrofitted to the property to improve the thermal performance of the property while also giving it an aesthetic facelift . The materials used in external wall insulation are specifically designed to work together to produce the desired effect " they normally all come from the same manufacturer . <p> Basically , an insulation board is glued ' to the wall using cement based plaster adhesive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On top of this another layer of cement based plaster is added and a fibreglass mesh is sunk into the plaster- while it is still wet . Finally , a top coat render is added to the system to give the desired finish " this can be any colour and also comes in a huge range of different finishes . Our understanding from speaking with a few external wall insulation manufacturers is that the insulation material is fully enclosed within base rails and the cement based finish from the external elevation of the property . <h> External Wall Insulation is a regulated market <p> The external wall insulation industry is a heavily regulated industry in the UK . Independent bodies such as the British Board of Agrement ( BBA ) and KIWA-BDA are notified bodies and UKAS approved to independently test and certify external wall insulation systems so they meet the rigours of the building regulations here in the UK . As part of this independent testing , the systems are tested against a number of elements including : water absorption , wind loading and combustibility . <p> Independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems design whether this is through specifications , profile drawings and site-specific engineering calculations makes the planning stage pretty comprehensive . <p> In addition to the manufacturers or system designers , the installers themselves doing the works may also be accredited with the PAS2030 or an equivalent quality management system . While these certification and procedural elements do n't necessarily guarantee the quality of the final installation , you can rest assured that those installers will be monitored and rigorously audited on the works that they do . Monitoring bodies who enforce the PAS2030 certification have the power to kick off bad installers to keep the standards in the industry high . <p> Finally , it is also worth mentioning that on bigger projects , like a retrofit of multi-storey properties or a number of properties within an area , the system designers will also send their technical teams to provide additional monitoring of the installers to make sure they are getting installed as they have been designed on the system specification and the BBA certificate . The installers themselves should also ( via the manufacturers ) provide maintenance advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during its lifespan . <h> Mineral wool and stone wool are classified as non-combustible <p> The insulation material itself tends to be either made from mineral wool or EPS . Mineral wool offers substantial protection against fire since it is non-combustible ( Euroclass A1 ) . Regardless it is enclosed within a layer of concrete adhesive , so the structural integrity of the system would remain intact even if there was a fire . <p> With regards to EPS , it is an organic compound so it would burn in much the same way as wood or paper if fire came into contact with it ( it would actually melt first ) . In the case of EPS used in external wall systems , it tends to include a flame retardant such as polymerised bromide to help decrease its flammability . <h> EPS is fully enclosed within the external wall finish <p> If there was a fire in the property , EPS would melt within its cement-based plaster enclosure , but the mechanical fixings would support and hold the structure of the EWI in place .

Therefore , we must allow the independent enquiry to take place , which will allow the evidence to be gathered and hopefully form conclusions about this incident , leading to even more robust standards in future across the building industry . <h> 7 comments <p> On 14 June 2017 , a fire broke out in Grenfell Tower , a block of flats in North Kensington , London . The fire spread up the outside of the Tower unexpectedly quickly , and initially , suspicion focussed on the Reynobond PE ACM cladding rainscreen panels . However , on 23 June 2017 , the Police confirmed that small-scale fire tests had been carried out on the Reynobond ACM cladding and the Celotex insulation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The insulation was more flammable than the cladding .

As long as the installer installs the system correctly and then the system is subsequently looked after by yourself , then you should n't have any issues . <p> The BBA is a paid for service to regulate the industry and despite manufacturers outside the UK going through every test and specification for Europe and world sales , the BBA insist that products are re-tested at very high costs and annual fees to remain approved . Despite being a part of the EEC ( until now ) this has been allowed to continue . Typically British Standard states that the Final surface finish on EWI does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My point is that approval of each component does not mean the systems are fitted correctly or customers are given all the options available . Will the whole country be a sea of white rendered houses , and just how many issues will come out of th e woodwork as with cavity insulation sold by the Double Glazing Direct Sales fraternity . <p> Hi Viral , That should be absolutely fine the JuB system is very good . Basically the rainscreen cladding is specified by architects to do a number of jobs in this case improve thermal efficiency ( due to the addition of insulation ) , improve the look of the building and also protect it against the elements . With this in mind the architect normally specs a whole range of different products that come together as a hybrid system to fulfill their requirement . In this case they opted for PIR board ( un covered ) , plus a void plus a flammable plastic outer rainscreen . <p> The jub system , much like other external wall insulation systems basically involve sticking insulation board to the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then putting a render on top . The insulation board is completely enclosed in cement adhesive . There is no cavity that can cause the chimney effect . All parts of the system are manufactured by the same company and are designed to work in perfect harmony together . <p> Basically the media is really sending out a confusing message . <p> EWI is different from Rainscreen cladding and EWI is completely safe . Rainscreen cladding can also be completely safe provided the materials selected are appropriate . <p> Hi reading this has me horrified , not by you but the standard of work done by the green deal contractors expanded foam used in gaps under sills up too 3 ins thick gaps between slabs of insulation overfills fitted after insulation done silicone put on in pouring rain , no officials looking at back of houses I can go on and on . the worst example was a curtain of mesh covered with polyfesin render and pebbledash therefore leaving the polystyrene exposed near gas meter <p> Hi Mr Fagan , I think unfortunately that is endemic of the grants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures ( e.g. loft insulation / cavity wall insulation ) jumped on the EWI bandwagon as they felt they could make a quick buck , despite having no experience in installing it previously . I think the key ( and this is not helpful for yourself having already had the work done ) is to get an installer in who specialises in EWI . We have a network of installers who fall into this category , so you can always ping us an email or give us a ring . Likewise if someone has had the works done and they are happy with their installer , go with their recommendation recommendations are normally the best way of getting a tradesmen ! 
@@36749123 @5749123/ <h> Cavity Wall Insulation Block of Flats in South West London <p> Cavity wall insulation is a procedure undertaken to insulate between the cavity of two skins of material ( brick or blocks ) to improve energy efficiency and minimise condensation on the inside of the wall . If done carefully and diligently , cavity wall insulation improves the internal environment of the property by ensuring a home or flat is not only warmer in the winter but cooler in a heatwave . <h> Project background Cavity wall insulation in flats <p> Together with our partners at City Energy and SSE ( the energy company ) , we embarked on a project in Southwest London to insulate over 60 flats in 8 separate blocks , each 3 storeys . These flats were of early 1960s construction , which means that although cavity walls pretty much became the standard in construction , unfortunately insulation was n't yet considered . <p> The team carried out all the energy assessments on the properties to meet the strict funding guidelines of- the government 's Energy Company Obligation . In short , the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be saved from the cavity wall insulation process . The projected saving of carbon allows the funder to calculate how much the project is worth . Ideally the funding amount would cover the cost of wages , materials and all the upfront survey costs , so that the end product the customer could be offered for free . In this case we managed to secure enough funding to allow us to do this . <h> Is insulation for multi-storey apartments / flats still free ? <p> However , if you are reading this post 2016-17 , we would assume that that projects like this where they are 100% funded by grants are no more . This is because the funding is now extremely limited , and the Government want projects like these to have an element of " self contribution " from the landlord or the customer . The Government no longer sees insulation as a " free product " , but rather an element that should be valued by the end user , hence the move to self contribution . <h> What materials were used for this insulation project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in the cavity wall insulation process , but in this case the results of the technical survey pointed towards using- mineral wool. - The whole project took 4-5 weeks to complete , with at least a month of planning prior to undertaking all the surveying .

But can the product really live up to the hype ? Is it worth more than just novelty factor ? <h> How does the technology work ? <p> Pavegens tiles are electro-magnetic .

This is where I can see the logic . The floor tiles are also not dependent on weather conditions , unlike solar and wind power . They are rainproof , working underwater at a depth of 1.5m . However , each tile can only generate tiny amounts of energy compared to other renewables . <h> What is next for Pavegen ? <p> They want the tiles to be global and affordable .

They will be popping up in several cities , although covering small areas . The idea will presumably be rolled out on a grander scale if successful . <p> The company also hope to tap into the idea of- the Internet of Things . The launch put a big focus on how the tiles could track- data to see how much energy is created in different places . Ex-Apple exec Jeff Martin has been recruited to make energy creation an immersive experience . He wants to link the tiles to smartphone accounts to help people better understand energy .

Its hard to think it would be worth their while unless there are large amounts of electricity generated , which the technology is not yet capable of . <h> Final thoughts <p> At its current rate of conversion , it sadly seems like a bit of a gimmick . However , it is definitely something worth keeping an eye on . It 's an interesting idea for energy harnessing that has no adverse effects on the planet , other than the CO2 emitted during manufacture . Although at the moment the tiles do not produce a significant enough amount of energy to meet the demands of modern life , if they were adopted on a wide scale the technology might become more viable . <h> 3 comments <p> Its really awesome , generating power just by walking on it , People should start using these kind of things so that we can generate much amount of energy and these tiles should be placed in the busy areas so that more power is generated .

We have seen the introduction of smart thermostats and intelligent heating controls , remote controlled lighting and app controlled multimedia systems . Large brands such as Philips , Apple and even Google are taking home automation and pushing it to the forefront of all product ideas . The popularity of these products have been boosted by the improved connectivity through smartphones and tablets , while improvements- in the manufacturing process has meant a reduction in cost to the consumer . Now , a few of these gadgets are advertised purely as luxury and not vital for everyday living .

Now you may argue that they are one in the same , but bare with me . We have already seen products such as LED light bulbs come up trumps with regards to both of these . They are relatively cheap and are proven to cut lighting bills by as much as 90% . If you take a bulb of 5W for example as a replacement for an old 50W halogen or incandescent bulb , not only does it provide great energy savings , as that is 45W no longer being used , but it also has significant cost savings as the cost of purchasing the bulb is fairly small relative to the savings that can be made .

@@36749127 @5749127/ <h> How Do Solar Power Diverters Work ? <h> October 16 , 2015 <p> We get a fair few comments regarding solar power diverters here at TheGreenAge . These clever little gadgets prevent electricity produced from your solar panels from being exported back to the grid by diverting the electricity to the immersion instead . <h> Why send excess electricity to your immersion ? <p> The reason for doing this is that under the Feed-in tariff , very few people have an export meter fitted as part of their solar installation " instead the Government assume you are exporting 50% of what is generated and pay you this accordingly . Therefore if you can use all the electricity that you produce in your home instead of exporting it then not only do you still benefit from the maximum feed-in tariff payments available you also benefit from the maximum energy savings . <p> On the whole these solar power diverters ( also known as solar PV optimisers ) divert the electricity to the immersion . They monitor the electricity being consumed in the home and the electricity being produced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surplus being produced they divert this to the immersion unit " without the power diverter in place , this electricity would normally be exported back to the grid " this is where the most common question we get arises . <h> A common misconception regarding solar power diverters <p> If the Solar power diverter kicks in at 70 watts surplus PV output , this would not be enough to power the immersion heater , these heaters are rated at 3kW , so would consume at least 3000 watts therefore the extra 2930 watts will be dragged from the grid and electricity bills would be- very large . <p> Excess grid power should be fed to the grid until sufficient power is available to operate the appliances , 70 watts will not do it . <p> Well obviously if this was the case it would rather limit the effectiveness of a solar power diverter ! Pulling in the shortfall of electricity from the grid would in fact cost you a huge amount of money . Fortunately on the whole they do n't work like that . We spoke to Bob Morris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he said the following : <h> The truth about solar power diverters ! <p> A TV and most other appliances that require an electronic power supply can only operate using full mains voltage and the power for which they are rated . If you were to restrict the power flowing into such appliances they will not operate " put simply the TV would not be on ! <p> On the other hand a heating appliance such as an immersion heater is a pure resistive load and will work at any power regardless of the rated power . In other words a 3KW immersion element will work quite happily if you were to restrict the power flowing into to say 1.5KW but it would only produce half of its rated heat energy . <p> Our Apollo GEM system electronically regulates the power flowing to such heating devices according to the export power available , just like you can restrict water flow by partially opening a tap . <p> If the available export power is ( say ) 70W then the gem will restrict the power flowing into the immersion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be 3000W . This ensures that no grid power is imported to run the immersion . <p> A system that simply waited until 3KW of export power was available and then turned on the immersion fully would be very inefficient and only be able to save a few percent of the power exported . <h> NOW JUST -249.99 <p> So there you have it ! A solar power diverter monitors both electricity being consumed by the house and electricity being produced by the solar system and will only divert when there is a surplus of electricity being produced " so hopefully that puts to bed a common misconception of how these clever little units work ! <h> 3 comments <p> We have a two phase supply to our property . The PV system feeds one phase on which there is a modest load most of the time , though it can peak. , But the main ( house ) load is on the other phase . We only have a single ( smart ) power company meter . How would your diverter work with this setup ? <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immersion heaters are much less efficient than a heat pump . Can you use one of these solar diverters to direct power into , for example , an air source heat pump that would generate 2-3x more hot water ? Since a heat pump is not just a resistive load I assume that they need a higher power input before they work . Can a heat pump be run from one of these diverters at a reduced power level and still provide some level of heat recovery ? <p> Its very unlikely that you could run a heat pump under such reduced power conditions . The electric motors used in the heat pump compressors have very specific power requirements and would not run at all otherwise .

Some installers will insulate around the obstruction , and this may be necessary if the obstruction is completely immovable , but it will cause a thermal bridge . Wherever possible , we will remove the fence post or gate , insulate the wall , then replace the item afterwards . This can require adjusting the length of the fence piece , or reworking the gate . <h> Dealing with meters and telecoms <p> Although it is possible to remove and replace meters and telecoms boxes , unfortunately we are not allowed to do so .

We have a range of panels to suit individual needs . You will need an inverter , which changes electrical currents from DC to AC , which can be used in the home . We also sell batteries to store energy you do not use straight away . <p> Is it worth the money spent on equipment ? <p> The Feed-in Tariffs scheme ( FITs ) introduced by the government is a financial incentive . Put simply , your energy supplier will pay a set rate for each unit ( kWh ) of electricity generated . Energy you do not use is fed back into the grid and you also get paid for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feed-in Tariff mean rates of pay have considerably reduced . However , any electricity you do not use instantly can be stored in a battery . Solar PV can be expensive to install , but they pay for themselves in the long run , with the FITs and the money they can save on your energy bills . <p> What size panel do I need ? <p> Obviously the larger the system you install the more electricity it will produce . The average solar PV installed in the UK now is 3.5KW , which at 90% will produce approximately 3150kWh of electricity ( depending how much sun you get in your part of the country ) . As reference an average house uses approximately 4,800kWh . The number of panels you can install will probably be limited by either the amount you can afford or the size of your roof . Suppliers will also charge different prices for their installation services and it 's important to ensure they are MCS accredited to qualify for the Feed-in Tariff . <p> How is electricity stored ? <p> A battery is connected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun is shining during the day , the battery is trickle charged with the excess electricity produced . Basically even if you are away from the house , you have background appliances like fridges , electrical appliances and so forth that are always on and using a certain amount of electricity . <p> In theory , the battery is trickle charged for the evening when the occupiers return home from work ready to operate all their appliances . If the storage capability is large enough on the battery system , there should be enough back-up to power the appliances for the rest of the evening . <h> Off grid <h> From -119.99 <p> Off-grid electricity produced by panels ( foldable or portable , as opposed to solar PV roof systems ) is stored by a battery . <p> What size panel do I need ? <p> An average 25w halogen light on for 3 hours will need around 75Wh of energy , a radio on for 2 hours will need around 50Wh , whilst a small 12v colour TV will use around 90Wh to run for two hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of these appliances , and want to run them all evening , you will need several hundred Wh of power . <p> How much energy will I produce ? <p> A 100W panel on a bright summer 's day will produce around 600Wh of power , whilst a 660W hybrid ( solar and wind turbine ) system could produce around 4,000Wh . A small 30W panel is going to produce around 200Wh . <p> What if the sun does not shine ? <p> In winter , you will probably produce far less energy " A 100W panel will only produce around 80Wh on an average winter day- but unless you are hardy enough to go camping in the winter you will use less too ! If you need to produce energy all year round , a hybrid system might work for you . This is a mini wind turbine and solar panel combined . On average this will produce more energy than a solar panel alone in winter . <p> What battery do I need ? <p> It is not as simple as just buying the biggest battery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality of the battery is just as important . Batteries lose charge when not in use , so make sure rate of loss is not too high ( an average rate is around 3% per day ) . Another thing to bear in mind is the number of cycles ' ( charges ) before charge falls significantly . Ours can be charged around 500 times . <p> The size of the battery required will be relative to the size of the panel " a 100W panel in summer will create around 50Ah of charge during the day . Therefore , a 50Ah battery is probably about right . A 660W hybrid system on the other hand , will likely need a 200Ah battery or larger . 
@@36749132 @5749132/ <h> Where does our gas come from ? <h> March 7 , 2014 <p> Up until about 10 years ago , most of the UK 's natural gas supply came from its own reserves in the North Sea . Unfortunately , from peak production of 1.2m GWh around the turn of the century , production has fallen steadily to less than half of that today . North Sea reserves are running out , and as a result we are importing much more from abroad ; this is leaving us very exposed to the volatile international gas market . <p> In this article I want to look at where we source our gas from , the price of gas , and what it will mean for us in the future . <h> Main sources of gas for the UK market <p> Our number 1 importer to the UK in terms of volume is Norway who sells us around 25.5 billion cubic meters of gas each year . To put that in to context , we produce around 43 billion cubic meters ourselves at the moment . But whilst our production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 1% more every year . <p> Unfortunately , Norway 's supplies are running out as well . This is really unfortunate , because gas from Norway is significantly cheaper than importing from further afield . Our second biggest source of gas is Qatar " who also provide around 25 billion cubic meters of gas , but the price is far , far higher . Where European gas costs us around 9$ per unit , gas from the Middle East is around 13$ . In the medium term future , this is where the cost of gas for the British public will begin to bite , as European supplies get squeezed , and expensive gas from Qatar takes its place . <p> Compared to these two big fish , other countries pale in comparison in terms of imports .

They are the biggest exporter in the world , and the growing Asian markets want to import it as well . The supply is effectively being squeezed from all sides , driving prices up . <p> But rising demand and falling supply is n't the only reason for the increasing cost . Conflict in the Middle East and the uncertainty it is causing in the market is also having its effect on gas prices . <h> Rising price of gas and the future price of gas <p> In such a volatile market , it is really tricky to know exactly what the price of gas will be in the future . DECC for example , has estimated gas prices could be as high as 105 pence per unit within 7 years , compared to a price of around 60 to 70p today . <p> Of course , if it were n't for the economic woes of the EU , things could be a lot worse . Falling demand in Europe has helped temper the gas prices that are being driven up by the soaring demand in Asia , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could Shale Gas save the UK from sky high gas prices ? <p> The slight unknown to throw into the mix is shale gas . In the USA , shale gas has had a dramatic impact on the price of fuel , in fact US gas prices are about 3$ per unit so less than a third of what we pay over here . No doubt US gas exports to the UK will be high on the political agenda over the coming years . <p> There are also thought to be considerable reserves of shale gas in the UK , however these are currently unproven and also in our opinion , extracting shale gas in the UK will never be quite as successful as it has been in the US " you can read more on that here . <p> However successful shale gas proves to be in the UK , it is certainly not going to happen overnight and therefore it is fair to say that for the foreseeable future , the UK will be relying on expensive imports to meet demand .

Finding the best energy tariff for you is really simple too. - Loads of people get stuck in a rut- or think somehow sticking with the same provider for years will somehow pay off . Do n't  be loyal you wont be rewarded for it ! More people are switching right now than ever before <h> How can I find the best energy tariff ? <p> It normally does n't  pay to stay with the same provider for years the big companies will always put profits over their customers and wed do well not to- let them get complacent ! Energy providers rely on people not bothering to switch , and if they know a consumer will stay with them whatever happens , there 's nothing dissuading them from hiking their prices . <p> Finding the best provider , and the best tariffs within them , can be really quick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its worth doing your research to see if you could be getting a better deal . Here are a few things to think about : <h> Cost of energy tariffs <p> There are several- online tools/price comparison websites to help you find the cheapest deal . When you start to shop around , you 'll notice some big differences in tariff costs . But where should you look for the best energy tariff ? <p> The Big Six energy providers ( British Gas , EDF Energy , NPower , E.ON , Scottish Power and SSE ) are rarely the cheapest . So do n't  just pick a supplier you 've heard of , or continue with the same provider that the previous tenants signed up with . <p> There- have been a couple of big price hikes recently from the big companies and there are more expected . This might encourage you to look elsewhere for the best energy tariff . But do n't  just wait for this to happen before thinking about switching you should be checking- regularly that you 're getting the cheapest deal possible . <p> A fixed-term tariff could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a contract for the next few years . You wont be subject to price hikes , so this can be reassuring for some . However , because the price is fixed , what is a cheap deal now may not seem so attractive down the line . So think carefully before tying yourself into a long contract . The longer a contract is , the higher the price will be per unit , because the energy companies need to be able to cover some of the future price rises within their costs . <p> It could also- be cheaper to get your gas and electricity from different suppliers , so definitely research tariffs separately ; its not as time-consuming as you might think . <h> Green energy tariffs <p> If you 're interested in- the environmental impacts of energy generation , there are some green suppliers- out there . These providers generate 100% of their energy from renewable sources , and some of their prices are really competitive too . <p> However , do n't  be under the impression that the energy you use directly will be renewable your energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of who your energy provider is. - The difference is that the green suppliers promise to generate cleanly the amount of energy you use from the grid , and pay it back in . <p> Providers are normally deliberately vague about this because ( unless you generate all your energy yourself through solar PV , for instance ) , they can not promise you 'll be using all renewable energy . But while you 're not necessarily using renewable energy yourself , you 're making sure other people are , and helping the planet in that way ! The more people that swap to a green energy supplier , the bigger the pressure for the UK to increase renewable energy generation . <h> Usage habits <p> Until now , how or when you use your energy hasnt- been a consideration when choosing an energy tariff except for those using storage heaters on Economy 7 . The UKs decommissioning of coal plants will signal the end for this tariff , and the heating technology it was designed for . But now there 's something a bit different . While Economy 7 only charged lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy , new time of use tariffs will charge several different rates , depending on the time of day and the day of the week . <p> There 's only one time of use tariff offered at the moment , Green Energy UKs Tide , but more are expected before the completion of the national smart meter rollout in 2020 . These new tariffs are good news for the bill payer and for the UK as a whole , because- the cheap rates are designed to help balance demand on the national grid , by encouraging people to use energy at off-peak times . If you have a smart meter , its worth considering a time of use tariff getting used to it might take a bit of effort , but small changes like running- appliances at night could save you considerable amounts of money . Of course , if you go for one of these tariffs and carry on regardless , then you may end up paying more for your energy it will require a bit of effort on the customers part to adapt their energy use to the cheaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that if you go away a lot you might want to choose a tariff with no standing charge . With most tariffs , a fixed standing charge is added to your bill monthly , on top of your usage . If you know you 're going to be away for three months of the year and wont be using any energy , there 's no point paying this . <h> Happy switching ! <p> If you do decide to swap , or if you have swapped in the past few years , check you have not overpaid . You may be due a refund and most providers wont tell you this unless you ask ! <h> 2 comments <p> We are on a tariff with First Utility that does n't  expire until July . They are already calling us on a daily basis trying to get us to sign up to their next deal so we do n't  shop around . The number of phone calls is staggering . It makes me think they are very desperate , but when will the energy companies learn that if they charge the lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Hi Simon , the churn rate ( % of customers leaving ) is a metric that all the energy companies are trying to improve . As such they will always be keen to get you signed up to a new contract before the existing contract goes . To be honest , since the Governments drive to make people switch energy providers , these kinds of phone calls are becoming more and more common . The cost of acquiring a brand new customer is far more expensive that keeping an existing customer hence they bombard you with better offers to try to buy your loyalty .

They can make your home nice and toasty in the morning though ! <p> Old models can be really inefficient , but new ones are much better .

@@36749136 @5749136/ <h> Outdoor Heating " What are the most efficient options ? <h> November 10 , 2014 <p> It is that time of year when the patio heaters get dusted down and fired up , not just in back gardens but in pubs and restaurants as well . We hear so often that patio heating is expensive to run and highly wasteful , as most of the heat goes straight up into the atmosphere . And that is true ; most patio heaters spend very little of their output actually heating a person . They will heat the atmosphere around a person , and being warmer than the air above , will then rise up , making that heat no longer useful . Some studies suggest an effective efficiency of just a few percent , and the EU has contemplated banning or restricting their use . <p> So can they ever even approach being an efficient option ? Let 's take a look at the options . <h> Gas vs. solid fuel vs. electric outdoor heating <p> There are 3 main ways you could consider heating an outdoor area . LPG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a canister of liquid petroleum . They are the most expensive option in the majority of situations because LPG canisters are pricey compared with electricity , and the units themselves are usually bulkier and more expensive . <p> Solid fuel heater can take several forms , but usually involve a small controlled fire or wood logs or pellets . Whilst this is a really nice image , the practicalities make it less useful , especially in a commercial setting . The smoke produced from the combustion gets in the clothes , hair and skin , and is not good news for your lungs if you are around it for long periods. - If the fire is open it can cause a fire hazard , and needs regular maintenance to keep it going all evening . So it is only really appropriate in certain settings " however quaint and attractive it may be . Environmentally this can be a much better form of external heating however , as if sustainably sourced the carbon emissions are zero . <p> A solid fuel burning outdoor heater <p> Electric heating is the third option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The heat can be switched on and off easily as needed , so you do n't need to burn the heater all evening if there is no one on the patio . Often they are twinned up with motion sensors , which creates an automated heating system . Electric heating can also be more focussed , pointing the heat directly at the target . <h> Infrared Heating for Outdoor Areas <p> Infrared heating " particularly far-infrared , is a great option for outdoor areas . Because the heat is directed and only heats surfaces directly rather than the air around it , the heat will warm people and not waste the energy heating the atmosphere . Of course , the surfaces will give off the heat gradually , so that heat will be lost to the atmosphere , but not before the heat has had a chance to heat the surface in question . The majority of heat from gas heaters goes straight up , without ever having the chance to warm anyone . <h> From -189.99 <p> Older near-infrared heaters are not as effective , as they tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convection unlike the modern far-infrared design . They can also damage your eyesight if you stare at them too long ! <h> What else can you do to heat your patio ? <p> You can make your heaters more effective , or indeed less necessary , by making the environment more suitable . This means reducing wind by putting up wind breaks where possible " wind has a big impact on the temperature , especially when you are trying to heat the area . Using awnings or gazebos to create a more closed in space is also useful , but just make sure that you heater and the material are not going to cause a fire ! And there is the old putting on a thicker coat trick to reduce the need for heating . 184576 @qwx384576 184572 @qwx384572

However EDF 's strategic priority is to maintain and extend the lives of as many nuclear power stations as possible . Therefore repairs were made and it was reopened on a reduced capacity in 2009 . In 2010 it was given a further life-line when EDF granted it an additional five years , on top of the original decommissioning date of 2014 , when plans were devised to enhance output close to full-potential . <p> Heysham 2 was completed in 1988 and built by the National Nuclear Corporation , using a larger footprint while at the same time not compromising on potential output .

As a result the Health and Safety Executive advised that an area south of the site of Heysham 2 , of around 80 acres , could not exceed the semi-urban criterion . The importance of water also causes problems in many cases , due to nuclear power stations requiring vast quantities in order to pump cooling water through the system , often at a rate of 50m3 per second . However , at Heysham the stations are situated on the coast and so these problems are minimised . <h> New Power Startion at Heysham ? <p> In 2010 , Heysham was admitted onto a shortlist of eight potential sites for a new power station . However , after EDF cancelled an agreement with the National Grid , talks seemed to cool over a third Heysham station , with thoughts turning instead to Hinckley Point and Sizewell .

Typically applied to the roof and walls of the attic , once sprayed , it expands and hardens . It has to be installed by experts with specialist equipment . There are two types : open-cell ( cheaper ) or closed-cell ( less permeable to water ) . Clearly , the idea is that it keeps your home at a reasonable temperature and stops heat loss , therefore reducing your bills . Closed-cell SPF has a U-value of around 0.16 w/m2K , which is not bad. - In the US , spray foam is included as standard in new builds . The UKs housing stock is older , and the take-up of SPF as a retrofit has n't  been huge , there are a few things to take into account before opting for this form of insulation . <h> Downsides of spray foam insulation <p> Installation : - Spray foam is often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its performance .

Here is a roundup of the favourites- we have used and recommended over the past year . Some are new , some are old favourites , - some are expensive , some are certainly not But all these products- have something to bring to the table when it comes to energy efficiency . <h> 1 . Infrared heating <p> Infrared- heating technology really is amazing . Unlike traditional radiators , it works through radiant heat rather than convection , and therefore does n't  waste energy heating air . When investing in infrared , you could overhaul your heating system , wiring panels into the electricity circuit and controlling them via a smart heating system.This allows for optimal savings , as you have total control and can also monitor your energy usage . Alternatively , you can just plug panels in to the mains wherever you want them for a boost of heat . <h> From -189.99 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control every element of your heating and monitor usage , allowing you to make little changes which save electricity and keep your home at the exact temperature you want it .

Stove fan <p> Stove fans are a really cheap and easy way to make the most of heat from your stove . Stoves can be a great way to make the temperature of your home more comfortable , and having spent money on fuel , you might as well make sure it goes as far as possible . Stove fans help circulate air around the room which would otherwise just rise to the ceiling . They are powered by heat , so there are no running costs . You pay a small amount for the fan in the first place and then it can help you save money for years to come ! <h> FROM -61.95 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulation , AeroTherm paste helps to trap heat which would otherwise escape . Just 1mm applied to walls can save up to 35% of the heat energy lost from your home . Installation is quick and you do n't  have to change anything about your home just a new coat of paint over the top ! <h> From -80.99 <h> 5 . Flexible/folding solar panel <p> Not an energy-saving product as such , but one that let 's you harness free energy when you would otherwise have to go without . Take a folding solar panel kit or a flexible solar panel with you when you go camping and you can still use a few luxuries without mains electricity . These are easy to transport and can be used to charge phones or air bed pumps ! <h> From -139.99 <h> 6 .

@@36749143 @5749143/ <h> Iceland Geothermal Power <h> Geothermal Power- Iceland <p> You do n't have to back far in time , in fact only back- to- spring- 2010 , to remember how Icelandic geothermal activity- impacted the UK and north-western Europe . Volcanic activity on the island caused ash clouds to build over the UK and grounded the majority of flights coming in and out of the continent . Although this was n't a comfortable experience , in the UK we can learn much about Iceland- harnessing- this natural energy source into geothermal power- to create both electricity and district heating solutions . <h> The History of Iceland- Harnessing Geothermal Power <p> For centuries , the people of Iceland have been using hot springs for washing and cleaning , however it was not until 1907 , when a farmer- from the west of Iceland used a concrete pipe to direct steam from a hot spring into his house , taking advantage of this- naturally occurring product- for heating . Since then , Iceland has been taking ever increasing advantage of it 's unique geology . It has even got to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heated . <h> What Makes Iceland So Unique to Exploit Geothermal Power ? <p> Well it lies directly over the mid-Atlantic ridge , which is essentially the crack in the Earth 's crust where the Eurasian Plate and the North American Plate diverge from one another . As such Iceland is an area of extreme tectonic activity , with regular occurrences of both volcanic and seismic activity . <p> In the volcanic region of the island , there are 200 active volcanoes , so essentially Iceland can be considered as one super volcano , formed over millions of years from molten rock bubbling up from the seabed ; as a result , the earth is particularly porous . <p> Iceland also has abundant precipitation , which as it falls gets absorbed by the sponge like earth . Since the Earth 's crust is relatively thin , magma chambers are positioned relatively close to the surface , which heats this water . There are approximately 20 high-temperature areas within the volcanic area of Iceland , where underground temperatures reach 250-C at a depth of only 1,000m . <p> This combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with approximately 66% of primary energy coming from this source ( both heating and electricity ) . In 2008 , close to 90% of the countrys heating came from hydrothermal sources . <h> Geothermal Power Station Examples in Iceland <p> There are currently 9 geothermal power plants in Iceland , providing in excess of 5000 GWh of electricity per year , the largest being the 303MW Hellisheidi power station , - operated by a utility company owned by the capital city of Reykjavik . <p> This geothermal power plant is a flash steam , combined heat and power ( CHP cogeneration ) - plant power station , which besides producing electricity , provides hot spring water to the city , via a 20km pipe , which is used for heating . This plant consists of 50 boreholes varying in depth between 1000m and 2200m to get access to the hot steam fields . The two other large CHP plants are the Reykjanes plant ( 100MW ) and Nesjavellir plant ( 120MW ) . <p> It is important to note that while only 30% of total electricity demand is met via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power using hydroelectric so is operating on a 100% renewable basis . In addition only a very small proportion of both its hydroelectric and geothermal power potential is currently been tapped into , so as the country continues to grow it will easily be able to maintain this 100% renewable position . <h> Applying Icelandic- Geothermal Expertise to- the UK <p> The UK has by comparison a very low percentage- of clean , renewable- energy being satisfied by geothermal power , with majority coming from wind farms or hydroelectric . To do more to exploit this geothermal energy source , - on 30th May 2012 , a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the UK and Iceland that will see the two countries look at developing the deep geothermal sector in the UK . This initiative is set to- explore whether an electricity cable can be laid between the two countries allowing Iceland to export it 's electricity , helping the UK hit its green energy targets . 
@@36749144 @5749144/ <h> Air to Air Heat Pumps for Heating <h> November 23 , 2015 <p> Air source heat pumps are a really popular way to heat your property these days , but most of the attention , at least for homes , is focussed on air to water heat pumps for wet central heating systems . These types of heat pumps are fairly efficient , and can be swapped in to replace other conventional wet systems really easily , without changing your radiators . <p> There are however , air to air heat pumps , which take cool air from the outside and use a condenser to take the temperature up to a level that can be used to heat the house . They work just like air conditioning units in reverse , and they can be used to both heat and cool the property . The only real difference is that air to water pumps have a heat exchanger which converts the heat in the air to warm water , of course allowing the warm water to be used in the central heating system . <h> RHI for heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air to water heat pumps . It can be speculated that this is because many air to air pumps are purely used for air conditioning , and it would be too difficult to differentiate for the purposes of government funding . <p> For air to water , the funding from the RHI is fairly generous , with several thousand pounds usually available for the average property , spread out over a 7 year period of payments . A really nice incentive ! <h> Hot water an advantage <p> One advantage of air to water heat- pumps is that you can heat your hot water as well as your central heating . With an air to air heat pump , you ca n't do this and you have to rely on an immersion heater for your water needs . Immersion heaters are a pretty inefficient way to heat your water and your hot water bill is going to be at least double that of a heat pump heated system . <h> Does this mean air to water is better ? <p> Whilst most domestic properties in the UK go for air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why is this ? This is probably because of the fact that America has more extremes of temperature , and many homes require cooling in the summer as well as heating in the winter . Air to air heat pumps can cool as well as heat , so they are well suited to dealing with the demands of a region with big ranges in temperature . <p> Unfortunately , if you are looking to retrofit an air to air heat pump , you will need to install ducting , and this can be really tricky and tends not to look too nice unless it is installed when the house is built . Air to water pumps on the other hand need a radiator or underfloor system , which can be equally expensive to install . <p> So if you want to have your heating and cooling all from the same system , then an air to air heat pump might be a useful option . The other thing is that it will depend on the current system . If you are retrofitting a property , it is obviously going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home where radiators are already present , whereas a house that already has ducting , but no radiators is going to much less expensive to install an air to air . If the house is bare with no heating system , it is going to be a case of weighing up the additional RHI money for going with an air to water , over the warm air option . <p> But given the RHI funding , hot water heating and ease of integration , it really makes sense to go for the air to water option in the majority of cases . <h> 2 comments <p> I inherited an air to air heat pump system ( Daikin Inverter ) when I bought this bungalow five years ago . The system had been installed by the previous owners some seven years prior to that at a cost of around -25,000 so I was told . Fifteen months ago one of the three units rokr down and after several attempts to repair it , I eventually paid out nearly -4000 for a new compressor , main board and when it still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same unit failed again . At first I was told it was the fans , then the Active module board and when it still did n't  work I was told that the compressor and main board needed replacing again and they were over the one year warranty period . I have now been without heating in my main living area for over a month and do n't  know what to do for the best . I do n't  know what to do for the best but am not prepared to throw more money at this system . I have travertine flooring throughout the main areas of the house and vents in the ceilings so underfloor heating or radiators would not work . Is there a similar A2A form of heating that would give me a more reliable form of heating/cooling that would come with more than a years warranty . I have little faith in the company who originally installed the system but have had no luck with Daikin and desperately need advice . <p> I have recently installed three air-to-air heat pumps to replace old electric storage heaters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very quiet under most circumstances , and operating the bedroom unit in " night mode " overnight makes it quiet enough to be almost unnoticeable certainly quiet enough not to disturb our sleep . The Daikin R32 units have an SCOP of about 5.9 , and test results available online from " Eurovent " in France showed a CoP of about 3 even at a source temperature of -15C . So far , with just two units operating I currently seem to be using about 11kWh per day for heating when external temperatures are in low single figures . My wife is a little unconvinced though the cats are getting to love the warm draft from the bedroom unit ! <p> Total installation cost was about -8,000 including electrical works , drains for condensate , etc . That compares to about -16,000 for a system with low temperature fan " radiators " usable with air-to-water . <p> As well as the heat pumps I installed an oversized Solar PV array last year ( 9 kW inverter , though it rarely produces above 8kW even in the summer ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooling in the summer ( the PV array will produce vastly more power than the heat pumps require on the relatively few days when cooling might be required ) . <p> The plan for the hot water is to replace the current immerser based water tank with a new mains-pressure heat pump hot water cylinder ( probably an Ariston or Giona unit ) , which will also allow me to get rid of the cold tank in the attic and further improve my attic insulation ! <p> We do n't  get an RHI payment , but on paper at least the efficiency should compare very favourably with air-to-water heat pumps and the up-front capital cost was a lot lower . Comfort is probably not quite as good ( the indoor unit produces a warm " breeze " which some may find distracting ) , but personally I 'm not keen on radiators anyway and I 'm trying to be as green as possible , so better efficiency is a big point . Note that the Daikin units have just about the highest SCOP available but there are other A2A heat pumps with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitsubishi ) . <p> Generally the high efficiency A2A units are relatively " small " typically rated at about 2.5-3kW for heating , so you will probably need more than one unless you have a very well insulated modern house .

But there is one thing that maybe you had n't thought of " your heating system . <h> Why conventional heating is bad for allergy sufferers <p> Let 's take a look first at radiators , the most common form of heating in a modern home .

The meter is very complex , taking into account several different factors that contribute to the efficiency and use of the heating , and it should give a very fair and accurate figure that will be used for your RHI payment . <h> How Does Metering work ? <p> You will get an extra payment to cover the cost of the metering , but unless you have to it is never worth getting a meter installed . This is because the total amount you can claim with a meter is capped at the amount you would get if a meter was n't present ( i.e. the heat demand on your EPC ) <h> Example 2 " Solar Thermal and Heat Pump/Biomass <p> As long as your solar thermal is for water heating only , you wo n't need a meter installed if you are claiming RHI for both the solar thermal and another heating system . This is because the two systems are independent and should n't impact on each other . <p> The solar thermal payment is based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biomass or heat pump is based on the heat demand figure on the EPC . <p> One little note for your information . If you are using two different heat sources to heat a cylinder , you are going to need two heating coils in your cylinder . This is because each heat source works at different temperatures and will need a different amount of surface area to heat the water in the cylinder . 
@@36749150 @5749150/ <h> What is fuel poverty ? <h> March 22 , 2016 <p> Most of us welcomed- the official start of spring this week . We have ridden out months of cold weather and we can finally look forward to some sunshine . However , for many winter is more than a nuisance ; it is a danger . <p> Monday night saw BBC Panorama investigating UK fuel poverty . Although official figures are lower , the End Fuel Poverty Coalition puts the number of fuel poor households in the UK at 4.5 million . Many people are spending more than they can afford , or going without what most consider a basic human need . In the year 2000 , the government said they would tackle fuel poverty by 2016 . Yet it is now affecting more people than ever and there are no signs of it easing . <h> What is fuel poverty ? <p> Until 2013 , the definition was simple ; households were fuel poor- if they were spending 10% of their income on fuel . The coalition government changed this in 2013 , and currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor if : <p> They have required fuel costs that are above the national median level . <p> Were they to spend that amount , they would be left with a residual income below the official poverty line . <p> Recent figures are skewed because the definition was changed , the number of households in fuel poverty conveniently dipped by more than 1 million . This has meant that the government has largely sidestepped questioning on the issue . <h> Why is fuel poverty happening ? <p> The causes of the issue are simple " gas and electricity bills are rising above inflation , and wages are not rising alongside . This places some people in a dilemma . They must either make cutbacks in other areas , or use less fuel . Those who have already cut back on everything they can think of are left in a horrible situation . <p> Rising fuel costs are not the only cause of the problem . The UK housing stock is not energy efficient and improving it is not a priority for the current government . Millions of people are paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roof . There are currently no- nationwide grants for insulating home improvements , and many can not afford to pay themselves . A number of incentives have been ineffective and the number of efficiency measures installed through government schemes has fallen by 80% since 2012. - The Green Deal was a failure . The Energy Company Obligation ( ECO ) " which in theory creates a legal obligation on energy suppliers to improve the energy efficiency of households " is winding down . <p> The government has two schemes for those who can not afford heating . The Warm Home Discount is hard to qualify for and is only worth -140 over the whole winter period . Some benefits claimants qualify for Cold Weather Payment , but in order for it to be paid out , the outside temperature must be below 0-C for seven consecutive days . In such extreme weather , -25 worth of heating does not go very far . If the weather is one or two degrees above freezing , there is nothing to claim . <h> Who is at risk of fuel poverty ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from- 2006 until the beginning of this year , - unemployment levels had been rising . However , people in work are struggling too . A 2015 study revealed that half of UK households living in poverty had someone in work . It is a myth that only the unemployed can not avoid to heat their homes . <p> As the poverty gap widens and more people are plunged into fuel poverty , there are knock-on effects . The catastrophic- rise in the use of food banks is no coincidence , as more and more people are forced to choose to heat or eat . ' Many are suffering health problems as a direct result of cold and damp . There is a proven link between fuel poverty and cardiovascular , circulatory and respiratory diseases . The young , old and long-term ill are most likely to suffer ( the latter two because they are unavoidably in the house longer , and therefore more reliant on heating ) . There is also the grinding mental strain that worrying about money causes . <h> What is being done to tackle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can kill , there is very little being done about the problem . In modern Britain , the fact stands that fuel poverty is reducing many people 's quality of life . It 's about time the government took it seriously . 
@@36749151 @5749151/ <h> Is electric heating expensive ? <h> September 14 , 2015 <p> In the UK , the cost of electricity is 10-15p/kWh and the cost of gas is just 3.5-4p/kWh . Therefore , on the face of it , heating with electricity is considerably more expensive than heating with mains gas ( e.g. a boiler ) . <h> How much do we spend heating an average sized home with gas ? <p> An average energy bill in a gas central heated home is approximately -1300 , of which 70% is gas and the remainder is electricity . Of the 70% gas , 85% of this is for heating with the remainder hot water " that means that approximately -775 goes towards heating ( -1300 x 0.7 x 0.85 ) . <h> So gas is cheaper , but is heating with electricity really that expensive ? <p> There are three things to consider when you are heating your home with electric radiators/storage heaters/infrared heaters ( which all run off electricity ) . <p> The first is the size of the system you install ; obviously a higher rated unit ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is switched on than a lower rated unit . <p> Say for example you were on an electricity tariff that charges 12.5 pence for each kWh used ( i.e. 12.5p / kWh ) . <p> If a 200w electric radiator is on for 5 hours that will use 1kWh of electricity " so will cost 12.5 pence to run . ( That is simply 0.2kW x 5 hours = 1kWh ) . <p> If a 1000w electric radiator is on for 5 hours it will use 5kWh of electricity " so will cost 62.5 pence to run ( 1kW x 5 hours = 5kWh ) . <p> Now , a larger room is going to need more heat compared to a smaller room , so obviously you will need either multiple smaller rated heaters or one large rated heater . The effect will be the same though ; a big room will cost more to heat . <p> The second thing that is going to impact the electric heating cost is the length of time that you keep your heating on for . <p> Take for example the 1000W @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 hour , it would cost 12.5 pence , but if left on for 10 hours , you are looking at -1.25 . <p> This therefore depends on your behaviour ; if you are spending more time at home and you require heating during these times then it is going to cost you more to heat your home with electricity ( as it would with gas ) . <p> The final piece of the puzzle is the temperature to which you heat your home . If you have some sort of thermostatic control in your home , this will send a signal to the to the heater to switch off when the set temperature is reached . <p> A lower thermostatic temperature will mean that your electric radiator is on for less time because the radiator has to work less hard to get the room up to temperature . So even if you set your radiator to be on for 10 hours during a day , it might only actually be pulling electricity for 4 hours for example . The rate at which the heating system will warm up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> What does this all mean ? <p> Well we need to produce an example to see how all of this feeds in to our calculations . An average house is defined by the Government as being 97m2 , consisting of 3 bedrooms , a lounge and kitchen diner . So in this situation you are looking at heating the 3 bedrooms , the lounge and the kitchen as well as most likely a couple of bathrooms . <h> How much would this cost to heat use electricity ? <p> Trying to keep it relatively simple , we are going to use the example of electric radiators . These convert 100% electricity to heat ( unlike gas boilers that would only covert each unit of gas into 80-90% heat ) . <p> On average to keep a room warm you should be looking at using about 150w for each m2 of floor space " an average home therefore would require 97m2 x 150w to keep it warm " so approximately 14,450 watts or 14.45kW of electricity . A really well insulated home would need less than this and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as 200w per m2 . <p> If you were to heat the home 24 hours a day and have no thermostatic control ( so the home would get warmer and warmer ) the cost would be as follows : <p> 14.45kW x 24 hours x -0.125 / kWh = -43 per day . <p> -43 x 365 days = -15,695 to heat your home every year . <p> That obviously seems ludicrously high , but let 's start stripping the number down and see how it compares to heating your home with gas . <p> Most of us only have the heating on during the cooler months " say for example from October 1st to March 31st. - That is 6 months , so that means straight away we have made an almost -8,000 saving . <p> Then we need to consider how much we heat the home " so which hours the heating is on . For most of us , we like the home to be warm when we wake up " so maybe for 2 hours in the morning , and then a few hours in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heating for 24 hours a day , instead we are only heating for 7 hours a day . <p> So let 's see where we are now : <p> 14.45kW x 7 hours x -0.125 / kWh x 180 days = -2275.88 <p> This seems a bit more reasonable , but we have clearly assumed that when a radiator is switched on , it is providing heat even if the thermostat is telling it not too . We have also assumed that all the rooms are heated at the same time for the same length of time . <p> So firstly let 's consider this 14.45kW number " if we divide that by 2 , you suddenly have an upstairs heat demand and a downstairs heat demand . <p> Upstairs tends to have bedrooms and so is heated for maybe an hour when you wake up and just the hour or two before you go to bed to make sure the edge is taken off . <p> Therefore the upstairs calculation is <p> ( 14.45/2 ) kW x 2 x -0.125 / kWh x 180 = -325 <p> The downstairs calculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat demand into 2 " half for the lounge and the other half for the kitchen . <p> So 14.45kW / 4 = 3.6kW <p> The lounge tends to be on for in the evening when the TV is on so for 5 hours in our simplified example but not on in the evening , but the kitchen tends to be only on for an hour or so , while cooking is taking place " then the oven starts taking over and heating the home , as well as steam from boiling pots and pans . <p> Lounge calculation " <p> 3.6kW x 5 hours x -0.125 / kWh x 180 days = -405 <p> Kitchen calculation is <p> 3.6kW x 1 hour x -0.125 / kWh x 180 days s = -80 <p> Overall " the heating cost of our average house is therefore <p> -325 + -405 + -80 = -810. - <p> So , while gas is is definitely cheaper , with the lifestyle considerations we have discussed above , electricity can be affordable too you just need to make sure to install the right heating controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity is absolutely extortionate . I live in a 3 bed bungalow ( originally 2 ) with heating supplied by electric warm air heating and the bedroom extension supplied with an electric wall mounted heater . We have to charge the heating up at night ( usually twice a week ) and release during the morning for an hour and evening for 3 hours at 11 degrees : This is usually from late October to mid-April . The cost at this time is around -180 a month and drops to -60 a month from mid April to late October . As you can see the heating during winter is unacceptably high and most of the time we are still freezing , however no help is forthcoming for grants/funding for alternative heating systems ; yes we own our home ( paying mortgage ) but are on a low income and struggle to pay for our heating costs . Energy companies are a rip off and do not care about how a family is affected by decisions on eating or heating . <p> I 'd say your home is either poorly insulated or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size all electric home and even in the depths of winter our bills come in at no more than -120 p/m and that 's with me having the heating so high that its warm enough to happily sit around in light pjs or even shorts which I like to do in the evenings . <p> You need to compare like with like . If you make the same assumptions for gas about how much you have the heating on and replace the 0.125 price for electricity in the calculations with 0.035 price for gas then you get -91 + -113 + -23 = -227 . Plus add on 10% or so because the efficiency is not 100% . Still much cheaper than electricity . <p> Your explanation is well written and your conclusion is pretty much as I had expected , however , you have n't mentioned the additional cost of servicing these modern boilers that give 80% efficiency ( If they are under full load ) . The reality is that using gas will add at least a further -100 per year for servicing alone .

Ensuring your renewable system is hidden from view will keep complaints at bay . Siting solar panels out of the public eye is clearly dependent upon the position of your roof , and wind power ideally needs to be situated away from any sheltered areas like trees .

In many cases , people just do n't fully understand renewables and the impact they have . When it comes to wind turbines especially , many people hear the extremist criticisms in the papers and worry about the impact on them . Wind turbines as part of a permitted development , for home use , are small ( span less than 3.8 metres ) and generate very little noise .

The promise of free electricity was fulfilled , their panels did not all blow off the roof in a storm and those- in the south of England demonstrably benefited from their geographical location , just like the salesman said ! Taking advantage of the Feed-in Tariff , a huge number of people made an absolute killing from their solar system . But even though 600,000 households have installed solar on their homes , there has always been one thing missing with solar energy- " the ability to use your own solar generated electricity 24 hours per day . <p> The exciting news is that this- is no longer the pipe dream it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar battery storage <p> Solar panels on roofs are no longer a novelty ; those who dismissed solar as a gimmick are now seeing it come of age , thanks to new battery storage technology . Its now all about maximising the benefits for those who have invested in solar . <p> Most of the 600,000 people who have installed solar panels on their properties have installed grid tied solar systems . A grid tied solar system allows you to feed the electricity produced by the solar panels back to the grid if you are creating an excess ( i.e your electrical appliances at home are using less electricity that is being generated from the panels ) . The other major benefit from a grid tied system is that when the sun does n't  shine you can draw electricity from the grid . <p> If you quickly consider the cost of electricity ( about 12.5p / kWh to buy ) , it makes sense to try and use as much of the free electricity you are producing as possible instead of sending it back to the grid . Battery storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess electricity back to the grid , you store it in a battery that can then discharge and power your appliances when the sun is n't shinning . <p> So with all this in mind where do you start when looking to install a battery storage system ? <h> Picking the right battery for your battery storage system <p> You have 3 choices at the moment when you are considering buying a solar battery storage system for your home . <p> Lead acid batteries <p> Lithium ion batteries <p> Flow batteries <p> Lead Acid Batteries <p> This type of battery has been used for decades as part of renewable energy storage systems , normally when people have tried to make the transition to living off grid . They are the cheapest type of battery on the market at the minute ( although Tesla are trying to change that ! ) , however they are limited on the number of charging cycles they can handle before they need replacing . Also lead acid batteries often require more maintenance then either lithium or flow batteries . <p> Lithium Ion Batteries <p> Lithium ion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the Tesla Powerwall and Powervault ( although Powervault also make a lead acid battery ) . These batteries are marginally more expensive than Lead acid batteries but can be charged and discharged far more- meaning they last longer . Lithium Ion batteries also tend to take up far less space than lead acid batteries and they are also self contained so they can sit easily indoors on a wall or out of the way basically they are maintenance free ! <p> Flow Batteries <p> These are the new kid on the block and could well be the future due to the fact that they can be charged and discharged theoretically an infinite number of times . There are two issues with Flow batteries firstly they are expensive , about twice the price of the Lithium Ion batteries . Secondly they are very complex , often requiring ancillary equipment such as pumps , sensors , control units and secondary containment vessels . This obviously adds to the cost , but also means they generally take up a big amount of space . <h> Get yourself a solar- battery management system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you are looking to store all that electricity you have created from your solar PV system ; but a major feature for the efficient use of this electricity is a battery management system .

The BMS also helps to make the- right decisions as to what to do with this valuable free electricity your solar system is producing . Almost certainly , your weekday usage will be different to that at weekendsv the BMS manages all this for you ! <p> A fully charged storage system will easily supply a familys lights and background usage once the sun goes down. - Sure if you need to run- a particularly power-hungry appliance , it may require more input than is supplied by your battery system .

But it goes without saying that the bigger the battery you choose , the more you will pay for the system .

When there is an excess of electricity being produced , this would normally be exported back to the grid , but the solar optimiser redirects this electricity to a storage system e.g. the immersion element on the hot water tank , a storage heater or a battery .

If there are no plans , or they are n't accurate , then the whole property must be measured up from scratch . In this instance , the layout was fairly simple , so the measurements only took half an hour or so , but sometimes this can be a long and frustrating exercise .

Some will have some very basic programmability , like a night and day temperature . <h> Programmable Thermostats <p> These are the most advanced type of thermostat , and allow you to control the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , usually with several different temperature settings in a single day . These allow you to be much more precise about the temperature you want and provide more flexibility . In addition , they can be used in conjunction with other heating controls to provide intelligent heating control . Technologies like the Nest , Heat Genius and Honeywell 's Evohome all are looking to take the programmable thermostat to the next level . <h> Quick Recap on how thermostats work <p> Regardless of which type of thermostat you have in your home , it will be working in tandem with your boiler to let it know when to turn on or off . <p> When you select the temperature on the thermostat , this is the temperature at which it will tell your boiler to fire up or switch off . If the house is cooler than this temperature , the thermostat will tell the boiler to turn on , hopefully warming up the house . As soon as the house hits the required temperature ( as set on the thermostat ) , it will send a signal to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for trying to maintain a consistent temperature in the home without having to manually turn on and off the boiler several times a day . The thermostat will also work together the a programmer giving you additional control , for instance , regardless of the thermostat temperature if the programmer is off , then the boiler wo n't fire up " this is great for when you have a relatively settled routine " for example there is little point heating the home if everyone who lives in the house is out between 9am and 5pm . <p> These heating controls are absolutely key to reducing energy bills since they ensure the gas boiler is only running when it is absolutely needed . <h> How do I use my thermostat ? <p> The most important thing to remember with your more basic thermostat is to set it and leave it . Set the temperature to the lowest comfortable temperature and you should n't need to adjust it very often , if at all . Using the thermostat as a way to turn the heating on " by temporarily turning the dial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you forget to turn it back down later , will waste a lot of energy . <p> To avoid this , we suggest starting at 18 degrees and turning up a degree each day until you reach a comfortable temperature . You should only really need to change the stat with the seasons from then on , and not just to turn the heating on on a cold day . <p> It is also really important to place the thermostat in a position where you have a free flow of air " if the stat is covered by curtains or furniture it will not work properly . So make sure it is in a nice open area like a corridor . <h> Using a programmable thermostat <p> Programmable thermostats offer a far more detailed control of the temperature . This is great because people tend to need different amounts of heat during your average day . At night , the thermostat can be set much lower , as the body needs less heat and you will be under a thick duvet anyway ! First thing in the morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our bodies have been in an inactive state all night " so this is a good time to have your thermostat set a little higher than usual . During the day you are likely to be out so the temperature can be set low again , and return to a comfortable temperature in time for you to return in the evening . <p> Of course , this is going to vary from house to house , and the programmer can be set in any number of combinations to best work with your lifestyle " but the principle remains the same . <h> When a thermostat is not enough <p> Whilst a good thermostat will really help you control your heating , it may be worth looking at thermostatic radiator valves ( TRVs ) for each of your radiators . TRVs let you control the heat in each individual room , so you are not overheating or underheating a room . You can also look at zone control and intelligent heating systems , which work especially well in larger properties to regulate the temperature in each individual room . <p> With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heat Genius system , you can actually change the temperature of your home using an app on a tablet computer or smart phone , providing you with even greater ability to save money . <p> With fuel costing so much nowadays , I would have thought its worth controlling each room separately if you live in anything bigger than a studio flat . No point heating the whole house when you 're only using one room . So either the cheap option of TRVs and running around adjusting them all the time , or the more elegant solution like Heat Genius . I imagine a system like that could pay for itself relatively quickly ? <p> Yep very true , we are getting more and more requests for this additional heating control . I think as time goes on , and energy prices continue to rise , the energy savings produced by things like heat genius are going to make them even more attractive but one of our customers recently said they saved 1/3 on their gas bills each month as a result of having this system installed so I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Help ! , I am a technophobeand having lived with an ancient boiler for almost 30yrs am having to . learn to use a boiler with a thermostat I NEED A SIMPLE EASY TO , USE THERMOSTAT.ANY SUGGESTIONS. ?

@@36749156 @5749156/ <h> What insulation materials are used in EWI ? <h> February 4 , 2015 <h> What insulation materials are used in external wall insulation ? <p> There are lots of different external wall insulation systems used to insulate solid wall properties " the EWI system includes the type of insulation , the render as well as the fixings that attach the insulation to the wall . <p> In this article we are simply going to look at the three different types of insulation material that can be used within a system " Expanded Polystyrene ( EPS ) , Mineral Wool and Phenolic Resin . <h> Using expanded polystyrene ( EPS ) in external wall insulation <p> Expanded polystyrene is the most popular product used in external solid wall insulation . It is a relatively inexpensive yet durable product and is lightweight , non-toxic , and is completely recyclable . <p> The expanded polystyrene ( known as EPS ) has fantastic thermal properties " for example applying 100mm of the EPS to a solid wall will take the u-value down to 0.3 W/m2k or better , which is an excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials , the thicker the product you use , the better the level of insulation . <p> Despite the EPS not having quite the same thermal properties as phenolic resin ( looked at below ) , its price and ease of use make it a favourite with external wall insulation companies up and down the country . It is also the most stable of all the sheet insulation used " so once it is put up on the walls there should be few , if any , issues down the line . <h> Using mineral or stone wool in external wall insulation <p> Mineral- or stone wool insulation used for external wall insulation is not the same make-up of product that you use up in the loft ! The wool used for this application comes in slabs and can the therefore be handled in the same way as the EPS boards . The thermal properties are very similar the EPS , however it is a more expensive material to install . <p> The one big advantage of mineral wool insulation used in external wall insulation is that it is fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the European Classification for fire prevention in building products ) , so in the event of a fire it will emit negligible amounts of smoke and fumes ( more on this below ) . <p> The other fantastic advantage of the wool products is that they are also great at reducing the noise pollution . The fibres in the wool are great at absorbing the acoustics , and perform much better in this category versus the other insulation materials . <p> The wool slabs are normally treated with a water repellent additive to ensure that no liquid water will pass through the insulation so you can be sure that if used on your home " there is going to be no penetrating damp in the home ! <h> Using phenolic resin in external wall insulation <p> Phenolic resin tends to be a more expensive form of insulation , and for some people is a popular solution . The reason for this is that the thermal properties of phenolic resin are very high " so you can achieve the same thermal insulating properties with a much thinner amount of material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Solid wall installers will avoid phenolic resin ) is that it can shrink and cause cracking down the line as the material shrinks on the wall . Now the shrinkage is not very big " just 1-2% , but even so , this can be enough to cause the material to fail in the long-run . <h> -99.99 <p> As a result we would strongly recommend you to look past phenolic resin if you can , and go with either the expanded polystyrene boards or the mineral wool insulation . The only reason we can see for using this product is if you genuinely need to adhere to some space restrictions ! <h> A quick look at fixings mechanical versus adhesive EWI fixings <p> Whatever the type of insulation used , there are three potential ways to attach it to the wall . You can either stick it on with a type of adhesive ( basically a form of cement based plaster ) with supplementary fixings or you can attach the system with- mechanical fixings and supplementary adhesive if required. - Or you can attach using a fully bonded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend that any installer you get to do your solid wall insulation uses both the adhesive and the mechanical fixings . Some companies will just stick the insulation to the wall , which over time can lead to it just falling off . Do n't let your installer cut corners for the sake of that little bit more money . If you are spending that much anyway , get the job done right first time ! <h> Fire classification of external wall insulation systems <p> The wool products are rated as non-combustible or A1 class as per European classification for building products . When added within an external wall insulation system , the fire classification can range between A2-s1 and A2-s2 ( taken from a sample of BBA certificates ) , which is either non-combustible or very difficult to ignite . Therefore for commercial buildings , high-rise blocks and public buildings , the wool insulation is a good choice- as it meets the very high- standards for fire prevention . <p> On the other hand , the EPS and phenolic systems tend to range between B-s1 and B-s2 fire prevention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry ) , which mean they are still very difficult to ignite . We have seen EPS used as a very popular insulation material in the EWI system , in low-rise and domestic properties , particularly as it is very easy to work with in the installation process . <h> Permeable or impermeable EWI systems <p> When people refer to external wall insulation , they talk about insulation systems " including the insulating material , the render and the means of fixing it to the wall . Although there are many different systems for solid wall insulation , one of the key things you need to check with the installer is whether the insulation system being used on your home is permeable or impermeable . <p> A permeable insulation system will allow the wall to breathe ; this means that water vapour ( not water liquid ! ) will be able to cross through the wall and insulation . This is very important since otherwise you can get moisture build up in the home , which can lead to much bigger problems . <h> Independent insurance for your EWI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is covered by a long term and independent- guarantee . External insulation is an extensive and expensive addition to the property , and if you have any issues with the insulation in the future , it could prove costly . Industry guarantee schemes like SWIGA or insurance backed schemes like GDGC , Kinnell , mean that even if the company you got to install the insulation is no longer in business , you will still have the consumer protection to take your claim forward and get your wall seen to and fixed . 184574 @qwx384574 184572 @qwx384572 <p> Its interesting you mention " permeable " insulation . I have read recent blogs from specialists in renovating old homes ( Victorian in my case ) that solid wall insulation ( Foam ) is a no-no as this can lock moisture in the solid walls and cause issues many years down the road . I would be interested in your thoughts on this as I would like to consider the Green Deal or alike to insulate my old cold house , but have concerns I would be doing harm than good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To insulate an older Victorian property , you can either insulate internally or externally ( no cavity sadly ) . We recommend external over internal for two main reasons firstly it protects the underlying brickwork and also since you are insulating externally you wo n't lose any internal space . I had external wall insulation on my property and we went with 10cm of EPS insulation ( it is also a Victorian property ) this would result in a significant loss of space . <p> In terms of materials to use we would only recommend EPS or Mineral wool ( e.g. Rockwool ) . Some companies are using PIR board , but these boards shrink over time which results in cracking of the system which can lead to water ingress . in terms of moisture being locked in this is not something we have come across to be honest . If water ingress occurs then that can cause problems but if the insulation is installed correctly then there really should be absolutely no problem . 
@@36749157 @5749157/ <h> How do smart meters work ? <h> February 9 , 2017 <h> What are smart meters ? <p> Smart meters measure your gas and electricity and automatically send readings to your energy providers . They are currently being installed free of charge across the UK the Government wants every house to have them by 2020 . <p> Smart meter readings are sent directly to your energy supplier via a secure national network ( DNN ) created specially for the purpose . This network is not reliant on wifi ; instead it uses radio waves . <p> You will get two meters to replace your current models , plus an in-home display . This screen will show your energy consumption in the last day , week or month . It will also tell you how much you 've spent , updated every half hour . Depending on the model , it may show other information too , such as the indoor temperature , or whether you 've gone over-budget . At the moment , it looks like they will have to run separately to smart heating systems- with separate displays- but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Smart gas- meters are battery-powered and give readings every 30 mins . Smart electricity meters run off the mains and gives moment-to-moment readings. - The in-home display is also wired into the mains and costs less than -1 a year to run . <p> They will be provided and installed by your energy provider. - If you have different suppliers for gas and electricity , the person installing the second meter- will be responsible for ensuring it links to the first , and that both link to your in-home display . - The smart gas meter will be around the same size as your current gas meter , and the electricity meter might be slightly bigger . They will be tucked away like your current ones are , however , so you probably wont even notice they 're there ! <h> What is the point of smart meters ? <p> Smart meters have quite a few benefits for householders . First of all , they remove the fuss of having to having to read meters or send readings yourself . <p> The other big benefit is that it does away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're also much less likely to get a big surprise when your bills come through at the end of the month . This is because- you can easily track how much energy you 're using as you go along , in real time . <p> Because you can better track your energy consumption , it should be easier to understand and control it . This could save you money on your bills if it encourages you to make some small behavioural changes- in the way you heat your home or use your appliances . <p> Prepayment customers will be able to top up more easily , without the need for a key or a card . They will also be able to see how much credit they 've got left , hopefully preventing the worry and annoyance of having your supply cut off . <p> Some people will take advantage of having smart meters to sign up for new time of use tariffs . If used smartly , these allow householders to take advantage of really low energy rates at certain times of day . The Economy 7 tariff which charges cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UKs coal power plants are closed down . Time of use tariffs are a sophisticated successor . The first was- introduced a few weeks ago , but most if not all providers are expected to launch them in the next few- years . <p> The long-term advantages of these changes are not just limited to householders , because UK energy network infrastructure could be put under less strain as a result of time of use tariffs . These could allow the National Grid to better manage power supply by flattening peaks in demand . This is important considering worries about the countrys approaching energy deficit . <h> What are peoples reservations about smart meters ? <p> Charlie , in the photo above , recently had a smart meter installed by British Gas . He s extremely happy with it at the moment . <p> - " The reason I organised for a smart reader to be installed is because my British Gas bills were very inconsistent . The smart reader allows me to track my weekly usage whilst also paying a static monthly bill which does n't  change dates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use and insightful . I must admit , I 'm a bit of a numbers man so analysing my usage is quite interesting , especially if it saves you money . " Charlie Rose <p> But some people are n't  quite so sure <p> Some people are worried about the hidden costs of smart meters . Energy providers- claim they are free , but the -11 billion nationwide budget has to come from somewhere , so it will be passed on to homeowners through their energy bills . However , the cost per household is low an estimated -6 per year . <p> There has been a lot written about the rumoured health impacts of smart meters . The truth is , they have undergone rigorous testing and Public Health England says smart meters pose no threat . Exposure to radio waves from smart meters is well within guideline levels , and is many times lower than daily exposure from wifi and mobile phones . You can view detailed- information from the Government here . <p> Others are worried about energy companies sharing personal data . This is no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are only allowed to share information which you agree to in your contract . The most- personal information they- could share would be to tell- companies such as price comparison websites how much you spend on your energy but they can not even do this without your consent . <p> Fears of hacking seem groundless , considering - the systems have been designed by GCHQ and other leading security experts. - It wont be easier- for your supplier to cut you off remotely or possible for them to fiddle your readings in order to charge you more , unlike some people claim . <p> What if you decide to switch provider after having a smart meter installed ? In theory , it should be possible to use your meter with any energy supplier . - Ofgen- has introduced guidelines stating- that providers should n't cause obstacles if you are switching to another provider . However , we have heard from consumers that switching providers- forced their smart meters into dumb mode ( which you can read about below ) . <p> . @beisgovuk Except having switched supplier at your suggestion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I cos you rushed it . <p> These teething problems should resolve themselves as the national rollout picks up pace , as they seem to have mainly affected early models , installed pre-2016 . <h> What if you do n't  want a smart meter ? <p> Energy companies have been instructed by the Government to take all reasonable steps to install smart meters in every home , but the bottom line is that they ca n't force you to have one ! <p> If you decide to opt out , your supplier may say it still has to replace your old model for safety reasons even the new ones will need to be replaced every 10 years but they will probably install a new model in dumb mode . This means the meters- smart functionality is disabled , - and rather than transmitting , it is instead read once a year in the old-fashioned way . <p> This is just us speculating , but it might be that as the point is to standardise smart meters , energy companies may not be happy about some householders- doing things differently. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on old-fashioned tariffs in future , effectively to penalise you for making things difficult ! <h> Our thoughts <p> A lot of research has gone into smart metering , and some of the concerns we hear about seem to be influenced more by conspiracy theories rather than facts . Smart meters are governed by strict security regulations and there is no evidence to suggest that they are hazardous to health . <p> It looks to us like smart meters will be worth our while in the long run The lowest time of use tariff rate at the moment is 4p per hour , which is insanely cheap , so if you can make the most of this , you 're on to a winner ! <p> If you 're worried about anything or you want more technical information , you should contact your energy supplier . <p> Have you had a smart meter installed ? Let us know what you think of it in the comments below ! <h> 4 comments <p> Smart meters are a ginormous scam by government and energy companies . Of course they are n't  " free " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you will pay a fortune at 6:00pm . So most people will suffer hugely . <p> Hi Dave I disagree ! There 's no reason why installing a smart meter would necessarily cost people money on their bills . Its actually likely to do the opposite . First of all , you do n't  have to change your tariff if you get a smart meter , in which case your rates will be the same as they are now , but you 'll be able to better track your energy usage . <p> The first time of use tariff LONG ... which was launched recently , only charges 11.99p per hour for electricity all through the day and a lot of the evening , which is cheaper than the average rate of 12.5p . The ( admittedly very ) high rate of 24.99p is only charged for 3 hours on weekdays mid-evening , and not at all at weekends . Its got to be a good thing if it encourages people to slightly change their habits so the National Grid can balance demand and avoid energy shortages in future ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our smart meter not working . It was installed in mid-December 2016 , but presumably missed the later in 2016 introduction of the DCC system . Just a waste . <p> Hi Tim , I agree this is completely ridiculous and something we have spoken to Government about . It is ludicrous that people are now unable to switch between energy suppliers with the freedom that they have previously had due to a new technology being installed in the home . It makes the energy industry more uncompetitive especially at a time when the big six are introducing huge energy price increases .

To date , approximately 3.3m smart meters have been installed , but the government has plans to get them in every home by the end of 2020 . <p> The theory behind them is sound ; the meters allow the energy companies to accurately measure how much energy is being used . They therefore only bill you for what you use , meaning no more estimated readings . <p> Smart meters should also allow the household to better gauge their usage and therefore take energy saving actions as a result . The energy companies providing the smart meters also provide a physical unit that sits in the house ( known as an In Home Display or IHD ) to make checking energy usage that little bit easier . <h> Time of use tariffs <p> Smart meters actually have another advantage seldom reported " all to do with time of use tariffs . At the moment , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 tariff , which allows people to draw electricity at two different rates depending on the time they use the electricity . <p> The Economy 7 tariff came about because the UK had large power plants that could n't be turned on and off like today 's gas plants . These tended to be nuclear and coal plants which would produce electricity 24/7 , so in an effort to increase demand during the middle of the night they charged less for it . <p> Time of use tariffs allow the energy companies to charge for gas and electricity at several different rates during the course of one 24-hour period .

Well the reason was highlighted by the Science and Technology Committee in an update they provided last month in the latest update on the smart meter rollout:The Government has known for years that early smart meters can lose their smartness if the customer switches supplier . Ministers merely have an ambition ' to fix this by 2020 . Taxpayers will be unimpressed with this situation , and timely action is needed . <p> It is pretty incredible that a scheme that will end up costing -11bn was rolled out with the knowledge that early smart meters will require replacing to remain functional .

It is all free and they reckon they can do it in 90 mins . I think it makes sense for us to do as I assume there is somewhat in which I can then check online my energy usage so I can make sure we are not using too much and try to cut energy usage when we are . The data protection side of it worries me a little though since if someone can hack this then they will be able to see when we are using energy and when we are n't  e.g. if we are in the house or we are n't  or likewise if we are on holiday . I wonder what you think about this ? Is this a risk ? Would be interesting to get your thoughts . 
@@36749163 @5749163/ <h> External Solid Wall Insulation , Barking East London <p> When we first visited this 1930s semi-detached , it looked tired and rundown . The first floor render was chipped and in need of serious repair , while the brickwork on the ground floor was being weathered and in a poor state . <p> From a energy- point of view , the property was losing heat rapidly through each of the three walls meaning bills were high and comfort was low . The old solid walls had a U-Value of around- 2.7W/m2k , so the customer frequently complained about being cold and damp . However , our installation of external solid wall insulation brought about a new U-Value of- 0.27W/m2k , which is better than current building regulations . <h> What External Solid Wall Insulation system was used ? <p> We decided to- insulate the property- with 100mm of EPS expanded polystyrene insulation with a Silicon Silicate render . This completes a breathable system with incredible results . This external solid wall insulation system transforms- the U-Value of the walls from 2.7W/m2k down to just 0.27W/m2k for all who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it simply means that the property is now more insulated than a brand new house built with cavity walls . The Silicon Silicate render- provides a fantastic finish , makes the property look new again and has- many of other advantages including the following : <p> Breathable system <p> Impact resistant <p> Durable " the render is 1.5mm thick . <p> Great- value quick payment <p> The job took just under two weeks to carry out this external solid wall insulation , with all pipework and fixings extended to maintain the thickness of insulation across the property and minimise thermal bridging . We ensured that waste pipes were only out of action for a 24 hour period to minimise the inconvenience on the household . <h> External Solid Wall Insulation , Tooting South West London <p> This solid wall insulation job involved insulating a 1895 Victorian property with 100mm of insulation . We see 100s of these properties every month and they all tend to be the same cold and draughty ! <p> The issue with these properties- is that the solid wall construction does nothing to slow heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the walls , you slow the movement of heat out of the house which means the heating system needs to work less hard to keep the house warm . <p> In this property in South West London , we wanted to insulate as much of it as possible without changing the appearance at the front of the house . It was for these reason that we decided to only insulate the back and sides of the house , leaving the front completely untouched to keep it in keeping with the rest of the street . Obviously in an ideal world from an energy saving point of view , we would insulate the whole of the property , however for this type of property we appreciate the aesthetic beauty of the brick itself and often it tends to be hard to get the relevant permissions from the local councils because - of the change in appearance . In this case it was deemed this was the best solution ! <h> What Solid Wall Insulation system was used ? <p> We opted to insulate the home with 100mm of EPS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silicate paint . This solid wall insulation system takes the u-value of the walls from 2.1W/m2k down to just 0.27W/m2k now for most of us who do n't  take in u-value speak that is better than a brand new insulated cavity wall built today to conform with building regulations . The mineral render and Silicon Silicate paint provide a fantastic finish and have a raft of other advantages including the following : <p> Breathable system <p> Impact resistant <p> Durable " the render is 1.5mm thick . <p> Great- value <p> The great thing about the solid wall insulation being applied to the outside of the brick is that this becomes a heat store , so will continue to release heat back into the room well after the heating has been turned off . <p> The job took just two weeks to carry out , with all the pipework extended to ensure a consistent thickness of insulation across all the walls . We ensured that waste pipes were only out of action for a 24 hour period to minimise the inconvenience on the household . <h> Infrared Heating Panels Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the- challenge <p> With ever rising- home working in the UK , demands for home office space is increasing this is why the Muspratts wanted to convert their garden room into a fully functioning office . Initially the room was retrofitted with insulation , in the roof space , walls and floors to bring the heat demand of the property down . Insulation should always be the first step for homes and businesses before heating systems are looked at . Insulation reduces draughts and increases the heat retention of the property . <p> Having completely refurbished the garden room , the Muspratts came to TheGreenAge to talk a little bit more about infrared heating . Initially infrared heating appealed very much because - it is easy to install , it can be installed on the ceilings , therefore blending unnoticed in the environment and the heat is drying and low cost to run . <h> The infrared heating panel solution <p> Having shared the floor plans of the property , the team helped the Muspratts size the panels appropriately so as not to be disappointed in the heating output . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you go too low then the heating output will not be adequate enough and you may be disappointed . The solution in this case was sized to accommodate heating - of 50 watts per m2 , which is fine because the property is well insulated . If you have uninsulated solid walls or unfilled cavities , then you many need to accommodate 100 150 watts per m2 . <p> The Muspratts went for three 850watt carbon fibre panels to heat an area of approximately 40m2 . Although they were slightly oversized , it is not a bad thing because the room would get to target temperature much quicker and therefore reduce the frequent thirst for electricity to power it . <h> Installation of the heaters <p> The heaters themselves were installed as part of the general retrofit of the property . This is a good thing because it further makes the installation process easier to- administer , as this can allow- for a nice and tidy wiring job with minimal trunken . The panels were wired to a wireless thermostat to allow the Muspratts maximum temperature and time control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer months , Mr Anderson decided that enough was enough and it was time to replace their old storage heaters . Instead of- directly replacing them- with new storage heaters they wanted to consider- other heating solutions that might be available to them considering they did n't  have access to mains gas . <h> What about the property ? <p> The flat itself was ground floor with 2 bedrooms and built in the 1970s with- cavity walls that have since been insulated by injecting them . The heat demand of the property therefore is not nearly as big as an equivalent solid wall property and since the house was mid-terrace there is very little heat loss with their neighbours and likewise through the ceiling because there is another flat above , however the heat demand is far higher than a house built today to building regulations . <p> Since the house did n't  have access to mains gas , a new central heating system was not possible , therefore efficient- heating- options were limited in our opinion there were 3 options , an- air source heat pump ( which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , infrared heating or fan assisted storage heaters . <h> Why install Infrared in the home ? <p> Mr Anderson was extremely keen to go down the infrared heating route for a number of reasons firstly the panels are thin- and therefore do n't  steal space in a room ( they stick out just over 2.5cm from the wall once installed ) , secondly the warmth they can produce can be felt far quicker than traditional heating systems and therefore are more cost effective since the heating does n't  need to be on as long . Lastly the panels look rather slick compared to other types of heating system . <h> How did- he go about the change to Infrared ? <p> We received the floor plan through from Mr Anderson so we could accurately size the panels based on his specific requirements. - We recommended 4 panels , one for each bedroom , one for the lounge and a final one in the corridor , each with their own thermostat ( to create heating zones in the home ) . <p> In addition to supplying the panels , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners to carry out the install in the home , which took just 1 day . His new infrared heating system cost just over -1000 and he now has a cost effective way to heat his home as and when he needs it , with the added benefit of being maintenance free unlike a wet central heating system . He also has the piece of mind that- our select range of infrared heating comes with a 5 year warranty and our Inspire range , built in Germany , comes with a 10 year warranty should an issue arise . <p> We are getting more and more customers who do n't  simply want to use infrared to supplement the heating in their home , they want to take advantage of infrared heating as a whole home heating system . <h> Combi Boiler and Nest Thermostat Watford , Hertfordshire <p> This installation comprised of a brand new Baxi Duotec condensing combination boiler- ( combi ) with a- Nest thermostat . The boiler and the heating controls were funded by the Green Deal , which is the Government approved energy saving scheme for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deal , customers like Mr Mileusnic can take out a Government loan and pay this back through their electricity bills . The scheme is a " pay-as-you-save " scheme , which means that installing energy efficient measures like new condensing boilers and state of the art heating controls can save the average occupier -100s on their heating bills . The Green Deal Finance component is the borrowing against that anticipated savings , so the consumer like Mr Mileusnic is no worse off . <p> To qualify for the Green Deal , Mr Mileusnic used us for the Green Deal Assessment , where in this case Henry ( one of our assessors ) went round the property and spent about 2 hours explaining all the energy savings that the customer could benefit from . A new boiler , heating controls as well as solid wall insulation were the top 3 recommended measures . With this assessment , Mr Mileusnic through our local Green Deal Provider partner organisation applied for the Green Deal Finance and with it progressed the measures right up them being installed on the wall as you see here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deal the customer managed to minimise his households upfront cost for the installation , and also have a brand new boiler that is guaranteed for 7 years ( labour &amp; parts ) . <p> The new Baxi Duotec combi boiler is an A-rated boiler , having a seasonal efficiency of over 89% . The Nest thermostat is not only a tool allowing the customer to set the room temperature , it is also a highly technologically advanced heat control system . With the Nest the customer can set-up electronic on-off times , use the sleek left and right toggle to adjust the temperature , be told about the weather and most importantly set-up the thermostat so that it can be controlled with a smart phone remotely through the internet . <p> Not only are customers benefiting from energy savings , but they can use the thermostat to function around their own day-to-day busy schedules . <h> External Solid Wall Insulation Ealing , London <p> Ealing is a fairly central part of London and most of the houses there were built over 100 years ago , and most of these homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Energy Saving Trust , uninsulated solid walls can account up to 35% of total heat loss , therefore addressing this area can make a big impact on the energy efficiency of the property . <p> The Elsleys are benefiting from a much more insulated household , having installed external wall insulation to the back of their mid-terrace home . Most of you may think that mid-terrace properties are ok - in terms of keeping the heat as they only have two exposed walls - while some of that is very true , as you can see the back of the house has in fact 3 exposed walls and if left uninsulated the heat just escapes and the property is not comfortable to live in . <p> Here , 100mm of Kreisel EPS solid wall insulation was used to insulate the external walls . The insulation boards stuck on with adhesive and are then mechanically fixed to the outside brick , held together by plastic caps . Once the boards are put in place they are then rendered over and finished with the waterproof top-coat . <p> The Elsleys were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was available to a limited number of applicants in 2014 , with the rest of the project being self-funded . <p> According to the EPC report that was conducted before the installation date , the Elsleys should save in the region of -200--250 on their annual heating bills and as well as that should have a much cosier and warmer home . <h> External Solid Wall Insulation- St Albans , Hertfordshire <p> St. Albans is a small a picturesque town on the edge- of London , and if you have visited it yourself you would have noticed that the buildings are predominantly made out of solid brick walls . <p> This latest install happened right on the edge of town , which features many 1920s and 1930s solid brick properties . Mr Pipers home is a 1920s detached property , and the reason he wanted to have solid wall insulation installed was not only to provide comfort and warmth but in addition to make his air source heat pump work more cost effectively . <p> 100mm of the Kreisel EPS solution was installed to the main flank walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the property . The Kreisel system is held together by mechanical fixings and reinforced but supplementary adhesive . The insulation is then prepared and finished over with a waterproof silicon silicut render . <p> The property had many openings for windows and doors and the key with external solid wall insulation is that as the walls are thickened with the boards , the window sills are extended and finished off so that no water penetrates the house . At the start of the insulating process the fixings like dishes , alarms and soil pipes are removed for the boards to be fixed in place . After this is done the fixings are put back into place and the top layers of adhesive , inner coat and outside render can be applied . <p> According to the energy reports carried out before and after the installation , the energy rating went up a whopping 15 points , going from a high E rating to a low C rating . Given that most solid brick properties have a poor energy score ( less than than the average band D ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> External Solid Wall Insulation Greenford , London <p> The external 100mm solid wall insulation solution has been installed on this semi-detached property in Greenford , Middlesex . In this case , Mr Smith- has benefited a little bit from the Government grant with the rest of the project being self-financed . <p> Many properties in this part of Middlesex- and Greater London- were built either in the late 1800s or early 1900s with solid brick walls , which means cavity wall insulation is not possible to do . Solid wall insulation can either be installed on the inside or the outside of the property , and the customer chose external due to space considerations and to maximise the benefits of the externally applied render solution . <p> Having the 100mm EPS Kreisel system solution installed , has brought- the property up to a band D rating on the EPC register . Not only has it improved the energy rating , the external wall solution will on average save Mr Smiths family- nearly -400- on heating bills . With the property being cosier and warmer it is also now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of the insulation to provide all these additional benefits . <p> The photos below show some of- the stages of the installation installation process : <p> Applying Kreisel EPS insulation boards . <p> External solid wall insulation at the back of the property , Greenford- London . <h> External Wall Insulation East London <p> The house in Greenwich was insulated with 10cm thick EPS insulation boards and then rendered with a silicate render . The External Wall Insulation ( EWI ) system used was the Kreisel System , which is an approved Green Deal system . <p> Adding the 10cm of insulation to the walls resulted in a u-value- of 0.27W/m2k , which is comparable with brand new cavity walls built today. - <p> It is estimated that this will save Mr Mincher over -180 a year ( and it is worth noting that he is a low energy user ) without taking into account any future energy price rises despite the fact in cash terms energy prices have doubled over the last 7 years . <p> In the following photos , you can see the transformation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pre Install <h> Boiler &amp; Flue Gas Heat Recovery System South London <p> With the help of our installation partner , this boiler was installed in South London under the Governments Green Deal Home Improvement Fund , which allowed Linda ( the customer ) - to access -1,500 worth of Government cashback towards the cost of the new boiler . The Green Deal in this case has significantly reduced the cost of the install to ensure that it was cost effective for the customer , and without it , the- cost of the job would have been prohibitively more expensive . Linda also had an option to take out Green Deal finance , which can also reduce the upfront cost however this option was n't taken-up this time . <p> The installation of this new Baxi combi boiler ( including the flue gas heat recovery system ) has taken the energy efficiency of the property from 46 on the EPC up to 55 . In addition as part of the boiler install- a Nest intelligent thermostat was also installed . This really is a neat piece of kit , allowing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; off times- through an application over the internet . So , if you are on holiday and forgotten to turn your heating off , then you can use this thermostat stop you worrying . <p> It is estimated that the new heating controls along with the new heating system will save Linda- approximately -118 per year without taking into account any future energy price rises <p> TheGreenAge works across Greater London and the surrounding areas to provide energy saving advice as well as working with approved partners to deliver installations of - energy saving measures ( insulation , energy efficient boilers , windows &amp; renewables ) . 
@@36749164 @5749164/ <h> Will the new Green Deal scrap the Golden Rule ? <h> March 21 , 2017 <p> We wrote a few weeks ago saying that the Green Deal is going to be relaunched . First , though , there are a few issues to iron out . The main sticking point left over from the last Green Deal is the so-called Golden Rule ' . This is n't easy to explain , but what it essentially meant was that the householder could n't pay more for an energy saving measure than it saved them on their bills . Whilst this sounds good , the Green Deal golden rule was- unrealistic and effectively meant some people ended up with insufficient funding for their measures . <h> The Golden Rule <p> This Golden rule ' made installing anything other than low-cost measures unattractive , and this contributed to the Green Deals demise in Summer 2015 . <p> Householders installing various energy saving technologies paid for them in small instalments through their energy bills ( the same amount they were expected to have saved in energy that month as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , the Government would only pay out ( as a loan ) the amount you were expected to save on your energy bills over the expected lifespan of the measure . Realistically , this- was n't always enough to pay off measures that cost thousands to buy and install . <p> Low-cost measures such as loft insulation paid for themselves pretty quickly . But of course , loft insulation and cavity wall insulation were and still are pretty well covered by the ECO grant , which means that a loan is very unattractive when a grant is available ! High cost measures with limited or no grant funding would be ideal for a loan scheme , but the Golden rule combined with some rather unattractive interest rates and set up costs made this also a poor option for a homeowner making a big investment . <h> So , what was the issue with other technologies ? <p> Take a boiler , for example . Someone might save -100 a year by installing a new boiler , so , after the 12 years the funding ' runs for ( the expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back around -1200 . Say their boiler actually cost -2500 " they are left with a deficit of -1300 which they will have to pay with no help from Green Deal funding . This is because the Golden Rule prevents them from paying back more than they have saved on their bills . Add 12 years of interest to the remainder of the debt . This left some people footing quite a big bill " an issue for many who were promised the scheme as a money saver . <p> So with the Green Deal scheme due to launch any time soon , providers are working to come up with a solution so that they can get going and hopefully bring people the genuine help the scheme was designed to provide . <h> What will change ? <p> The Golden Rule is set in stone by government legislation , and the new scheme can only break the rule if the law is changed . This may well happen in the future , but with a releaunch being imminent , it is unlikely the scheme is going to get rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to take some time to get the legislation in place to allow larger loans on the electric meter . <p> The relatively high interest rate of the old scheme would probably also need to be reduced in order for a bigger take-up of the scheme this time around . Our sources tell us that this also is unlikely to change , at least in the short run . <p> So how is it going to be different ? One of the key changes we are hearing mooted is that there will be a change in how the savings from the new measures will be calculated . The old scheme used some generic assumptions about the savings to be made from installing a new boiler or a heat pump for example . The new scheme is likely to consider the model of the new installation and this is likely to mean the predicted saving swill increase somewhat , allowing a greater loan to be provided that still meets the Golden Rule . <p> We also expect there to be fewer Green Deal Providers , which work a bit more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that assessors and installers are to be directly accredited and overseen by the new privately run company . This is a little controversial because the scheme was designed so that assessors could lodge their reports with any number of Green Deal Assessor organisations , accredited through various administrative bodies . This allowed a great deal of competition and freedom in the market for assessments , which on the whole were the most successful part of the scheme . This is another part of the scheme which needs to be looked at legally . <p> Another point that is brought up frequently regarding these loans is how it affects a homeowner who is moving home with a Golden Rule , this was somewhat easier to swallow for the new owner , as they could be sure that the savings to be made from the new installation equalled or outweighed the monthly cost of the loan . If the Golden Rule is scrapped , it would be easy to make a new homeowner pay for an installation over and above the savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of worms . <p> So plenty of things to ponder for the new private owners of the Green Deal . We think that a lot of these problems are surmountable , but there are going to have to be some legislative changes . 
@@36749165 @5749165/ <h> Changes to the Energy Company Obligation <h> December 6 , 2013 <h> What is the Energy Company Obligation ? <p> The Government has announced this week that it is to change one of its key components of domestic energy policy , the Energy Company Obligation ( ECO ) . This change comes only a year after the scheme was launched and is the result of aggressive lobbying from the energy companies . <p> In May 2010 the Coalition pledged to become the greenest government ever ' , and since then it has tried to live up this pledge by implementing schemes such as the Renewable Heat Incentive ( RHI ) for both commercial and domestic properties and the Green Deal &amp; ECO . However , the Government has already been accused of watering down these fledgling green ' policies . <p> To those reading this who are unaware of what the Green Deal and ECO are ; put simply they are the two schemes ( that can be used in conjunction with one another ) that are charged with making homes more energy efficient . They allow households @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make any big up-front investment and in some cases measures can be installed completed free of charge . <p> The Green Deal part is for those homes that want to increase their energy efficiency but do n't have the funds to necessarily do this straight away . The Green Deal allows homeowners to take out a fixed loan that they repay back through the savings they make on their electricity bills ; whereas ECO is the grant component funded by the energy companies that fully or partially pays for energy efficiency measures . It can work standalone to help pay for insulation and new boilers for vulnerable members of society or partially subsidise Green Deal measures like solid wall insulation , which would otherwise be too cost prohibitive in the free market . <p> Where ECO gets a bit more complicated is that it actually has 3 components : Home Heating Cost Reduction Obligation ( HHCRO ) , Carbon Saving Community Obligation ( CSCO ) and the Carbon Emission Reduction Obligation ( CERO ) " this year the Government committed to -1.3bn of home improvement funding and the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the following sections we look at the changes the Government are making to the ECO scheme . <h> Changes to ECO " impact analysis <h> Home Heating Cost Reduction Obligation ( HHCRO ) <p> This part of ECO is designed to help the most vulnerable members of society get insulation and cost saving heating measures to be installed . So for example if you are on pension credit you may be eligible for a free boiler replacement as well as loft and cavity wall insulation " this is subject to a detailed eligibility assessment . <p> Impact of policy change : the Government has committed to maintaining the funding levels for this particular obligation and has even gone as far as extending the funding at the same level for a further two years ( until 2017 ) . <p> Although on the face of it , there is no change to this element of ECO , we are awaiting news on whether the funding will move from an obligation on the energy companies to general taxation . <h> Carbon Saving Community Obligation ( CSCO ) <p> This particular obligation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most deprived areas of the country as defined by the ECO order .

However , in our experience very few assessors will be happy to accept existing EPCs since the accuracy of them tends to be rather variable depending on the quality of the assessor ! <p> If , since getting the EPC , major works have taken place to the property that will have significantly altered its energy efficiency , you will need to get a new EPC completed regardless . <h> What Will my Green Deal Report Look like ? <p> The Green Deal Report is a 5-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what the report looks like , and you can click here to learn exactly what each of the different sections on the report looks like . <h> How do I go about claiming Green Deal Cashback ? <p> A full , step-by-step guide to applying for cashback can be found here- - <h> What if I do n't have 12 months of energy bills <p> If you do not have any information regarding energy bills , or have lived in the property fewer than 12 months then the Green Deal Report will not be able to provide you with accurate savings tailored to you . However , this does not affect the amount of funding you may receive as this is taken from a typical household living in your property . <h> Why is there a fee for the assessment ? <p> The fee is based on the work required to produce the report , including the site survey , travel time and lodgement fees .

@@36749169 @5749169/ <h> 7 things you need to consider before installing solar PV <h> April 4 , 2014 <p> In this blog , we take a look at some of the key considerations you should be aware of before installing a Solar PV system . <h> 1 . Is your roof strong enough ? <p> Some buildings , especially older ones , may not have the roof strength to support solar panels . Post 1970 structures usually have W ' frame trussed roofs . These will readily support solar panels , which generally weight about 20kg each . Older structures may require inter-truss strengtheners , although this is not a particularly costly procedure . All roofs should be checked however , as any roof can have woodworm or termites that would severely weaken the roof . Many solar companies offer free surveys , where they will assess your roof for suitability . <h> 2 . Do you require planning permission ? <p> You do n't normally need planning permission to install solar panels , but it is always worth checking with the local planning officer just in case . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , restrictions may apply , so once again , speak to your local planning officer . <h> 3 . Do you need to replace your tiles ? <p> If you need to replace tiles on your roof having installed the solar panels already , it is going to be a costly procedure , since you are going to have to temporarily remove the panels . Therefore it is worth getting them inspected prior to installing the panels in the first place so this issue wo n't impact you . <h> 4 . How much electricity do you want to produce ? <p> One solar panel typically produces 250W of power " so we recommend going for at least 10 panels , which will give you a 2.5kW system . You can go smaller but this will obviously limit the amount of electricity you produce and the resulting money you receive from the feed-in tariff . <p> It is also unlikely you are going to be able to install a solar system that will cover all your electricity needs since you will need to install batteries to be able to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your solar system ; therefore not many people opt for living off-grid ' . <p> A normal house typically uses about 4,800kWh of electricity over the course of a year and a 3.5kW system ( 14 panels ) will typically produce about 2,900 kWh of electricity . So you are still going to have to buy a bit from the grid " the limiting factor for the number of panels will tend to either be the size of your roof or the amount you are will to pay " but on the whole bigger is better ! <h> 5 . How much do you want to spend on your solar PV system ? <p> I guess this follows on a little bit from point 4 , but on the whole this is going to be the deciding factor . You can want the biggest solar PV system in the world , but if you only have a few quid to your name , it makes paying for it rather difficult . <p> Obviously this varies with the size of the system you get installed , but as a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the UK , we experience few blackouts , but unfortunately for those with solar panels , when they do happen , you are unlikely to be able to use them to power your home . This is because most solar systems are connected to the grid using a grid tied inverter , and if the grid is shut down during a blackout to allow necessary repairs to take place , they do n't want any electricity to feed into the grid . So whilst they might be a great investment , they wo n't save you in a blackout . <p> If you do want to protect yourself from blackouts you are really going to need to invest in battery backup " this is very costly , but it can be done ! <h> 7 . Will your panels be shaded ? <p> Shading can really impact the amount of electricity produced from a solar array . If the solar panels are all on the same string , and one of the panels is shaded , all the panels will have the electricity production limited to the one shaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day when a chimney casts a shadow , but if this is at 2pm then it is significantly going to reduce the return from your solar panels . Therefore you need to have correctly positioned them ( taking on board advice from the installers ) and potentially you might wish to put panels on different strings to ensure that you maximise the electricity produced from panels if you know shading is going to be an issue . <p> Need Help ? Call us on 0208 819 9153 <p> Finally and this is something that lots of people fail to take into account . Trees ! Trees grow and they grow tall . Your solar panels will have an estimated useful life of 20 years + so think about how the growth of trees over time might cause shading . We come across so many households that have failed to take this into account and are wondering why they are suddenly not producing the same levels of electricity as two or three years ago . <h> 4 comments <p> I installed 10 solar panels at my new home in 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 years . I am now wanting to sell that property.I have a number of questions . 1 . can i sell the property but retain ownership of the panels ? 2 . Could the panels be physically removed and installed on my new home and could i then continue to receive payments , or are the panels " linked " to where they were originally installed ? <p> According to the EPIA , France produced an estimated 4,600 GWh of electricity from solar in 2013 which was about 1% of their total energy usage . Germany produced 31,400 GWh of electricity from solar which is just over 5% of their total 607,000 GWh yearly demand . <p> In terms of the UK , in January 2014 , the Government announced over 500,000 homes have now had solar panels installed on their homes this is some going ! However , the last electricity consumption figure we have for the UK was was 274,800 GWh ( 2012 ) and in 2013 solar provided about 2,015 GWh of electricity , so the amount it contributes is actually less than 1%. 
@@36749170 @5749170/ <h> Commercial EPCs " What you need to know <h> June 15 , 2015 <p> Domestic EPCs are pretty well understood " most houses have had one done by now and there are several reasons for having one . Commercial EPCs are less widely carried out , mainly because the reasons for having them crop up much less often . <h> Why do you need a commercial EPC ? <p> You will need an EPC on your premises if you are : <p> Selling the property <p> Renting out the property <p> Building a property <p> Claiming government funding for Feed in Tariff 's <h> What makes a commercial EPC different ? <p> Apart from the obvious " that a commercial EPC is carried out an a commercial property rather than residential , there are some fundamental differences in how the survey is carried out . <p> A commercial EPC looks at how each area of the building is used " whether that is for office purposes , dining areas , storage or a workshop area for example . A domestic assessment purely looks at the fabric of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the space . This means that a commercial EPC can fundamentally change depending on the user present , whilst a domestic EPC will not change with different occupants . Having said this , a commercial EPC does not take into account your energy usage , like a Green Deal Assessment , so occupancy is only partially reflected in the EPC . <p> Commercial EPCs have to consider a far wider range of properties . A domestic property always has a bathroom , bedrooms , a living room and kitchen . A commercial property could have any number of different possible rooms , some the size of aircraft hangers and some little cubicles , some heated , some only partially heated . This huge variety makes the assessment process much broader with many more things to consider . It means there is a much wider range of possible heating and cooling systems . <p> The variety means that there are assessors for different types of building " the accreditation goes from level 3 to level 5 non-domestic energy assessors . The vast majority of assessors are qualified to level 4 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . Level 5 assessors are the only ones allowed to produce certificates on complex properties with large atria and curved structures . For most customers this wo n't be an issue , but if you have a very unusual property , you may need to pay more for a level 5 assessor " there are n't that many around the country as the demand is not very high ! <p> The process to produce a commercial EPC is much less automated . Over the years , the domestic EPC has been refined by the various accrediting bodies , and various streamlined software produced to allow the EPC to be carried out quickly and simply . The commercial EPC is currently a smaller market , and that has meant the various software and support has lagged behind . Consequently commercial EPCs are much more time consuming for the assessor and will cost more to produce . You could expect your assessor to be on site for hours , and in some cases may need to revisit another day . They will also ask for a number of different types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so be prepared to provide specs on the HVAC systems , floor plans , planning documentation , details on any renewable installations and any number of other pieces of information that the assessor may not be able to ascertain themselves from a site visit . <p> Cost is one really big difference . Domestic EPCs , even for the biggest of properties , should cost well under -100 , with some companies offering them for under -50 . Commercial EPCs are much more expensive , with starting prices for smaller properties starting at -100-150 and larger properties costing several hundred . The largest and most complex properties could cost you thousands . You are much more likely to find wildly different prices in the commercial sector also , with the competition not quite the same . <p> So there are a few things to consider with a commercial EPC that you would n't have to think about with a domestic assessment . The key thing is to make sure you provide your assessor with as much information as they require , and allow them access to the whole property . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your property . The more information you provide , the less the assessor will have to assume default values ( these are always poor and will produce a much lower rating on your EPC ) and the higher your EPC is going to be . <p> Give us a call if you have any queries about your commercial premises " we will be happy to help and provide a quote . 
@@36749171 @5749171/ <h> Types of Solar PV Setup <h> Renewables <p> Each solar setup has its own benefits and limitations , and it is important to gain a real understanding of these before you invest in a potentially expensive solar PV system , to help avoid disappointment further down the line . <h> Grid-tied solar PV Systems <p> 99% of solar systems installed on peoples homes are what 's known as grid tied systems . These grid tied systems allow you to take advantage of the free electricity you create from the solar PV system as well as the the electric grid . This gives you much more flexibility , since you are not reliant on the sun shining to allow you to use electricity you can use as much electricity as you want at any time . <p> Any shortfall in supply from the solar PV array can be met by additional electricity supplied via the grid , but there is also the added benefit of being able to sell any surplus back to the grid . In essence , a grid tied system will go someway to reducing your dependence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money savings ( obviously any electricity supplied from the grid needs to be paid for ) , but will give you the comfort of 100% supply from the grid if something were to go wrong . These systems are also simple to install and are less problematic than other types of solar PV installation due to their lack of batteries . <p> Grid tied solar PV installations have become incredibly popular in the UK recently due to generous- government subsidies- ( guaranteed for 25 years from the date of installation ) . They do help reduce your reliance on the grid , and also reduce your electricity bills . However you still need to be connected to the grid for this system to work effectively . <h> Off grid/standalone solar PV systems <p> Producing 100% of your own electricity in a clean and sustainable manner is the dream scenario for many people ; the thought of never paying another electricity bill , and never suffering from grid blackouts is obviously a very attractive proposition . <p> However an off-grid system does not need to be this sophisticated and grand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden shed , or a water fountain in your garden . For this reason , the off-grid installations are in fact the most common type of solar installation across the globe , providing electricity to any isolated location , normally where no other electricity source is readily available . <p> The disadvantage is that you essentially become the utility company , so any costly repairs fall under your remit . If there is a problem with your supply for any reason , you will not have electricity . Solar power is also an intermittent source ( not producing power 100% of the time ) , so if you need electricity during the night ( for lights in your house etc. ) you will need to install batteries within your system , that enable you to store energy during the day and use this when you are not producing . <p> The rewards for installing an off-grid system are clear , however the increased responsibility of owning your homes electricity supply could make this a potentially daunting task for solar PV beginners . <h> Grid tied with battery backup systems <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the grid tied solar PV system described above . The batteries will require additional maintenance and add significantly to the final cost of the system , and they will also introduce additional inefficiencies within your system " potentially a 15% loss in overall performance . <h> Grid fallback systems <p> Electricity is taken from the batteries and run through an inverter to provide the electricity required in the home . Once the batteries begin to go flat , the system automatically switches over to grid power , allowing the solar panels to once again charge the bank of batteries , and the process starts again . <h> Installing Solar PV <p> Are you thinking about installing shortly ! <p> Interested in getting a solar PV system installed ? 184572 @qwx384572 
@@36749172 @5749172/ <h> What are the lifespans of your energy saving measures ? <h> January 13 , 2016 <p> In this blog , I am going to give you a rundown of the expected lifespans of all the various energy saving measures around the home . Some I think will surprise you ! Many people do n't take into account the expected lifespan of a measure before they go ahead and install it , and that means they perhaps do n't understand fully the costs and benefits of going for certain technologies . <p> Boilers " Energy efficient boilers are extremely high performance at up to 90% efficient . Unfortunately , modern boilers also have lots of things that could potentially go wrong , and their lifespan is much shorter than older boilers . Most estimates give 12 years as a rough guide to lifespan of a boiler . <p> Cavity Wall Insulation " Cavity walls can be insulated with polystyrene beads , spray foam or fibre glass . These materials do not break down and whilst a top up is sometimes required far down the line , the insulation should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorrectly installed is there likely to be a need to remove and replace it . <p> Energy Efficient Lighting " Where old halogen and tungsten filament bulbs used to blow all the time , modern CFL and LED bulbs should last a very long time , and many are rated for 10,000 up to 50,000 hours . That means you bulb could still be running 20 years from now . Lower quality bulbs however will not last this long " you get what you pay for here . <p> External Wall Insulation " Having EWI installers Be Constructive in our office , we can reliably inform you that EWIPRO has been age tested by the BBA and is expected to last 30 years or more . It will probably require a bit of TLC by this time , including painting every 10 years , but the insulation itself will not degrade . <p> Heat Pumps " Various studies we have looked at give a range from 14-20 years as the life expectancy of a heat pump . These are complex bits of machinery that are in constant motion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the years . Expect to have to replace them every 15 years . <p> Loft and Floor Insulation " Loft insulation has been around for years in a few different forms , but the most common type of insulation " the mineral or rock wool " does not lose efficacy and there is no reason why it will not still be insulating your home 100 years down the line . Floor insulation is made from the same material and there 's no reason why it wo n't also last a very long time . <p> Secondary Glazing " Sheltered by the outer pane of glass , secondary glazing will likely last longer than the external window , however this life expectancy will vary with the exact style of glazing . <p> Solar PV " Solar panels are incredibly durable , and although they will gradually lose some generation ability over the years as the panel 's age , they will still be producing energy 30 or 40 years down the line . Bear in mind that the inverter will need changing at the cost of around -1,000 every 10 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thermal system is 15 to 20 years . It is significantly shorter than the lifespan of PV because of the moving parts and wear and tear that it will go through in its life . The RHI will pay you over seven years rather than the solar PV feed in Tariff , which pays over 20 years however , so you will get you cash back fairly quickly . <p> Storage Heaters " These heaters again have few moving parts , and are of a fairly simple design . You can expect a storage heater or electric heater to last a very long time . Indeed , most old 70s storage heaters are still working today . The same will apply to other kinds of electric static heating systems , like electric convection heaters and infrared heaters . <p> Wind Turbines " Turbines go through a lot of wear and tear over the years as they are constantly in motion , unlike a solar panel . Government estimates put the average turbine at 20-25 years of life , but as they approach their latter years they will need more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Double glazing is a favourite for those doing home improvement . Nothing sharpens up the look of a home like some new windows . Unfortunately the outlay for windows is huge , and the lifespan can be much shorter than you would hope for . Standard double glazing will only last 20 years at best , and the vacuum or inert gas between the panes will have been compromised long before that , making the windows less efficient . Extended guarantees can be found , but it is perhaps wishful thinking that a company is going to service your windows in 20 years time " most companies do n't even last that long !

So if you happen to be out and about and want to get home to a toasty warm house , then you simply log into the software on your phone " both Android and iPhone , and turn up the heating . <h> Why is Hive Active Heating- necessary ? <p> When we are talking to customers , a lot of people do n't fully appreciate the need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the recommended levels , for example 270mm of loft insulation , cavity or solid wall insulation , draught proof the property and put double glazing in , then you could save your self a lot of money on your heating bills . <p> The only way you are going to see the savings though is by putting down the heating , otherwise you are going to spend a great deal of money , and your home is just going to get very warm . The whole point of energy efficiency is allowing you to live life the same , but using less energy to do so . So in the home , that means the temperature needs to stay the same as it was prior to installing the insulation and as a result of the insulation , you will need less gas ( or other kind of heating ) to maintain the temperature . <p> A thermostat allows you to do just that , and a wireless thermostat is even better " since you can move it around the home to the most effective place . For example positioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every time the door opens , cold air will rush into the home and fire up the boiler , when potentially this is just not needed . <p> Furthermore , British Gas have enabled homeowners to control this thermostat from anywhere via 3g on their phone and the Hive Active Heating App .

Hive is a gimmick , a product of someones warped imagination , the sort of thing someone thinks of and then tries to create a market for it .

This was in a house with plenty of loft &amp; cavity wall insulation as well as high-efficiency double glazing . I also have hot water provided from solar thermal panels so I am now maxed out on energy savings in terms of heat generation &amp; insulation . <p> The benefit from a system such as Hive is that it enables scheduling timing &amp; temperature control on a day by day basis . My remote thermostat is in the open plan living room/kitchen so directly controls the temperature in this space . <p> Recently I have installed LightwaveRF Wi-Fi controlled thermostatic radiator valves ( TRVs ) . I had hoped the Hive type system would provide further functionality of this sort ( i.e some form of zone heating control ) but that has not happened .

If no one is at home we do n't  have the heating on . Our boiler has a built in frost protection . Our current boiler can heat up very quickly so we just turn on the heating when we get home ( house is warm in 10 minutes ) and turn it off an hour before we go to bed . I fail to see how turning the heating on 45 minutes before we get home is going to save me money .

Set up your existing thermostatic radiator valves accordingly That way when the existing central thermostat hits temp the other rooms will be at your required level . Much simpler and much cheaper ! 5 . One of your commenters mentioned that the cost of keeping the Virgin router on would outweigh the cost of any savings .

@@36749176 @5749176/ <h> Identifying damp in my home <h> September 17 , 2014 <p> Unfortunately , damp is a really common problem in UK homes . Despite this , many people do n't understand what causes it and how to help mitigate the problem . In this blog , I am going to take a look at the different types of damp and ways of identifying damp , and how we can try to prevent it . <h> Why is damp in the home a problem ? <p> Let 's first look at why damp is a problem . There are several key reasons : Damp causes mould , which is bad for your health and looks unsightly . Damp can cause structural damage to a property , especially if there is timber within the structure . Further , it can damage your walls and require constant cleaning and painting to keep it at bay . <p> There are 3 different types of damp that are commonly found in the home . <h> Penetrating damp in my home <p> This is caused when water gets through the outer barrier of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain , but roof defects , faulty brickwork , defective cavity wall insulation , or defective windows also can cause it . <p> This can obviously manifest in a number of different ways , and the solution will depend on the root cause , but as a starting point , brick work can be repointed , walls can be sealed and sealant can be applied to windows and doors to prevent water entering . In addition , you may want to consider rendering the entire property " since this will produce a water impermeable protective layer . <p> If you do decide to render the entire property , we also suggest insulating it ( with- external solid wall insulation ) this will help lower the heat demand of the property at the same time thereby reducing energy bills in the home , but it has an added benefit which is discussed further down . <h> Rising damp in my home <p> Rising damp happens when ground or standing water is drawn up through the brickwork into the home through something called capillary action . You will notice a property with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wall where the water has risen . It tends to occur in old properties ( 100 years or more ) which were not built with a damp-proof course . This is a barrier built into the wall that prevents the water from rising above it . Rising damp can also occur where the course has failed . <p> A case of rising damp <p> There are several ways to treat rising damp including : addition of a damp-proof course , DPC injection , and draining the land directly around the building . These unfortunately can all be quite expensive ! <h> Condensation in my home <p> This is perhaps the most common cause of damp in a property . There are a number of causes , but they usually boil down to a mix of excess water vapour in the property ( caused by cooking , showering , and even breathing ) , combined with lack of ventilation ( caused by blocked vents , poorly installed insulation , unvented windows etc . ) <p> The best way to identify this problem is to test the humidity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , but there are some telltale signs . If you get beads of water on your walls and steaming up of your windows , chances are the damp is being caused by excess humidity . This will case mould to form in poorly ventilated areas of the room . <p> Condensation in London homes is becoming incredibly common as homeowners block up holes that have previously provided ventilation . Take for example old wooden sash windows ; if you have have ever been in a property with these you will know how leaky they are well these gaps- around the window actually do help ventilate the property , so when they are replaced with airtight uPVC double glazing you can see how this kind of problem occurs . <p> It is also amazing the number of people that cover up ventilation from the inside of the property all this serves to do is lock the moist air within the home . <p> The issue is that if the excess moisture in the air has no where to go and it comes in contact with a cold surface , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you deal with it ? <p> Increase ventilation in the home <p> Increase the surface temperature of the walls so the water vapour can not condense <p> Use dehumidifiers to remove moisture from the air <p> Increasing ventilation is relatively simple and involves unblocking previously blocked air holes in the property . You can also add additional vents in the home to help encourage the passage of the moist air out of the home . While cooking and washing , you can open windows to help get rid of the moist air too . Obviously one of the issues with ventilation is that cold air can enter the home through these vents one way of avoiding this is to use heat recovery ventilation systems , which use heat exchangers to ensure that the heat in the air is not lost to the external environment . <p> There are a few options to increase the surface temperature of the walls , but remember this is not going to reduce the amount of water vapour in the air , it is simply going to inhibit it condensing on the walls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; this means that the brick work will warm up , since the warmth cant travel through the insulation . The second is to use a heating system that uses radiant heating , since this too will raise the temperature of the surface it is directed at infrared heating panels are just one way of doing this . <p> The final method is the least energy efficient since you are using technology to remove the moisture out of the air these units are designed to suck in air , remove moisture and kick out the dryer air back into the room . They are not a long term solution though since they are expensive to run , so increasing the ventilation is always the preferred option . <p> So in summary to avoid condensation- you can either reduce the cause of the humidity , or increase the ventilation . It may be possible to reduce the effect by opening windows when showering or cooking , not drying clothes indoors and using devices such as dehumidifiers , but you may need to go further and add vents to the property to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure your current vents are not blocked " over the years they can easily get gunked up and stop them from airing the property . <p> So those are some of the major causes of damp Hopefully this demystifies some of those common causes and helps you understand why your home is growing mould and gives you a few options to get it sorted !

So we 've been thinking of common energy-saving tips ' we 've heard ( or even once believed ourselves ) that are in fact total rubbish . Here are some myths we 'd like to dispel : <h> Running electric convector heaters is cheaper than central heating <p> This one 's so common . In my student days , it was a recurring source of argument in my house ! Really , it could n't be further from the truth . How much exactly each costs varies on your energy rate and relative efficiency of models , but it 's pretty much unheard of for a convector heater to be cheaper . A convector heater will cost upwards of 24p per hour , which is a lot if you add it up over a day ! Even if you only need heating for a couple of hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will stay warm for longer once you switch it off . This applies both for heating one room , or several . <h> Painting radiators black makes them more efficient <p> The confusion here springs from the misconception that radiators emit most of their heat through radiation " the name is misleading ! The theory is that dark colours radiate heat more efficiently . However , as radiators work mostly through convection ( the transferral of warm energy to cooler places ) , the idea that painting them black would increase their output is nonsense . Painting your radiators is worth doing , as it helps to protect them , but do n't bother doing it for on this pretence . <h> LED bulbs are more expensive <p> No ! One LED bulb lasts as long as eight CFLs and uses a quarter of the energy over its lifetime . They are far more efficient than traditional light bulbs , which give off most of their energy as heat . In fact , LEDs use 90% less energy . Sure , they 're a bit pricier to buy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the savings you 'll make to your energy bill ! <h> Electronics do not consume energy when they are switched off <p> Some vampire devices ' use energy when plugged into the wall , even if the socket is turned off . Many of them use energy to run those red standby LEDS . Others suck energy even though they 're not on standby one way to tell is if they stay warm even when they 've been switched off . Where possible , unplug things like TV set boxes them from the wall when not in use to make sure . Similarly , chargers plugged into a computer or socket can also drain energy . <h> Double-glazing is the most cost-effective way to keep heat in your home <p> Ultimately , any see-through product is never going to be insulating and you will always lose considerable heat through your windows . We 're all bombarded with adverts reinforcing the misconception that everyone should have double glazing . Whilst double glazing can help your home retain heat and muffle sound from outside , it 's really expensive for the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Obviously , the less heat gets wasted leaking out of windows and walls , the lower your energy bill will be . You might save upwards of -100 on your annual energy bill , but it costs thousands to install double glazing throughout a house . In short , you 'll never make back anything like the money you spend ! <p> If you 're willing to consider alternatives , it would be much more worthwhile to spend the equivalent money on wall insulation . Walls prevent heat transfer far better than windows and this means a more comfortable home and lower bills . <p> Another option is secondary glazing . It 's cheap , easy to install yourself and can be removed on warm days when you do n't want your windows to trap heat ! <h> The higher the temperature you set your thermostat , the quicker the room will heat up <p> This one 's simple " setting the temperature higher means it will actually just take longer to reach and therefore cost you more energy and money .

The panels circulate liquid coolant , which extracts heat from the air around it and turns it into gas . This gas then passes through a compressor , which boosts its temperature until it is warm enough to heat water . <p> The technology hinges on the temperature variation between the coolant and the air around it .

@@36749180 @5749180/ <h> What is a capacitor ? <p> A capacitor is much like a- battery , but instead of using a chemical reaction to create a flow of electrons and therefore provide power for an appliance , the capacitor stores electrons . <p> As such a capacitor is far simpler than a battery , and is used in all sorts of electronics today , to provide a small amount of electricity storage . <h> What is inside a capacitor ? <p> A basic capacitor consists of two metal plates separated by a non-conducting substance known as a dielectric ' . In theory the dielectric substance used can be any non-conducting substance , but in practise specific materials are used such as porcelain or mica to give the capacitor particular features to fulfil its role . <h> How does a capacitor work ? <p> When a capacitor is in an electric circuit , the electrical source pushes negatively charged electrons on to one of the metal plates . The dielectric substance in the middle prevents the movement of these electrons across the circuit , so this plate becomes highly negatively charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When the repulsive force of the negatively charged plate becomes large enough , it repels further electrons from approaching the plate , and at this point the capacitor is charged . The capacitor can then discharged , which involves allowing the electrons to complete the circuit , providing electricity that can be used for anything . <h> Using capacitors in commercial scale processes <p> Capacitors are most commonly used in many everyday electric circuits and appliances , for example in mobile phones where they help maintain the power supply while the main battery is dead to prevent losing information stored in the memory . <p> Recent advances in capacitor technology have lead to super- capacitors that may have the potential to store energy on a commercial scale . <p> These super- capacitors do not have the conventional dielectric separating the two plates ; instead they consist of two plates made up of a sponge like substance known as activated carbon . These plates are separated by a nanometer thick separator and then are immersed in a liquid electrolyte where a current is applied to them . Electrons then build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional capacitor ) , but as there are free positive ions in the electrolyte solution , a layer of positive ions builds next to this negatively charge plate . <p> The same occurs at the positive plate , where free negative ions are attracted to this plate and build up around the positive charge . Therefore in an super- capacitor each carbon electrode ends up having two layers of charge coating its surface , hence these are sometimes referred to as double layered capacitors . <p> As the super- capacitor is discharged , the negative charge on the plate weakens , which releases the positive ions back into the electrolyte solution and the same happens at the positively charge plate , allowing it to be recharged once again . <h> How do you make super capacitors hold enough charge for commercial uses ? <p> The capacitance , measured in Farads , is how much electric energy a capacitor will hold given a certain voltage and is based on a few factors which are described below . <p> The surface area of the plate coating . In super- capacitors the coating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has an incredibly large surface area , helping to maximise the number of electrons that it can hold . Graphene is now being also being used in supercapacitors ; it is made from pure carbon , with atoms arranged in a regular hexagonal pattern but the sheets are only one atom thick . One gram of Graphene has a 1520m2- surface area , so this characteristic obviously helps the super- capacitor to hold an incredible amount of charge . <p> The voltage the capacitor can handle . The higher the voltage the capacitor can handle , the more charge it can hold , so it is key to pick a material that can handle very high voltages . <p> The distance by- which the two plates are separated . The size of the electrical field generated within the capacitor is inversely proportional to the separation distance . I.e. the smaller the distance the larger the electrical field , hence in supercapacitors the space between the two plates is nanometers thick . <h> The future of super capacitors <p> Tesla Motors chief executive Elon Musk has recently come out and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too distant future . They can be charged in a matter of seconds , and discharged and recharged millions of times without any degradation in performance . <p> Compared to old style capacitors , a super- capacitor has the potential to store about 1500x the amount of electricity , but only about 5% that of a lithium ion battery . However , the ability to release the power is useful , for example if a particular job requires a very short , strong burst of energy , using a capacitor would be better than using a battery . <p> The hope is that in the coming years , capacitors will become comparable to batteries , so they can hold more charge . Imagine for example , the ability to charge your mobile phone in seconds . <p> For long-term commercial energy storage , capacitors are still someway off , although even now they can provide a mechanism for dealing with spikes in demand across the grid .

It is something you can even DIY if you want to . Often however , people have a sloping ceiling , with no loft space at all . This makes insulation a lot more tricky , and indeed expensive , but if you want to bring your home up to standard , then it leaves you with little option . <h> Is my Sloping Ceiling Insulated ? <p> If you have a loft , you can simply take a look for yourself and see what insulation is there . If you have a plastered sloping ceiling it is much more tricky . The first thing you can do is to consider the build age and any renovation works that have taken place . Most properties built in the 70 's or earlier will not have any insulation in the roof . Anything built or renovated after 1980 may well have some insulation , but it is not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the sloping roof is insulated . <p> If this is all unclear , you will have to drill a hole in the ceiling and take a look with a boroscope . <h> How can you Insulate a Sloping Ceiling ? <p> If you want to insulate the roof , the first step will be to strip away the plaster and reveal the supporting beams underneath " usually wood . Your installer will then attach insulation board to the batons and then add new plasterboard . This whole process is obviously fairly extensive , and will cost around -40-60 per square meter . The process is very similar to adding internal wall insulation to a timber frame property . <h> Is it worth Insulating a Sloping Roof ? <p> Although the cost of insulating a sloping roof is fairly high ( you are probably looking at several thousand pounds for a whole house with this type of roof ) , the savings will be great . Chances are the roof has little insulation , and the savings are going to be big -300 a year would be a good estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years " not too bad when you put it into the context of other big home improvement works . <h> Loss of height with Insulation ? <p> One thing you will have to bear in mind when insulating a sloping roof is that extra layer of insulation is going to reduce the room height somewhat . Now if your roof is high or this is not an issue for you , then it probably wo n't take much thought , but if reducing the height by 10cm or so would be a problem , then your options are more limited . <h> Alternatives to full insulation <p> If full insulation is a bit too expensive for you , or you do n't want to lose room height , you could look at using a thermal liner to insulate the ceiling . This is a 4mm thick insulating wallpaper effectively , which helps keep the ceiling from losing heat . It is not going to be as effective as 75mm Celotex , but it will help reduce issues like condensation , and offer some help in terms of heat loss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meter , and you can either install it yourself or get in your own installer.

Remember , the Feed-in tariff is what makes solar PV so attractive , providing a return of approximately -800 every year ( guaranteed for 20 years ) . The return is made up of the actual Feed-in tariff payments ( for generating the electricity and exporting it back to the grid ) as well as- the reduction in your electricity bill you simply use what you produce . <p> Remember , key to getting the highest Feed-in tariff payment is to submit your application with an EPC with at least a Band D efficiency- rating if you do n't  do this , you- will be paid the- lower feed-in tariff payment , which will dramatically reduce your solar PV return . <h> Are there cheaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels , but chances are they are using low quality Chinese panels and inverters , which are liable to pack up very quickly .

HOW MUCH is it .. why wont anyone I ask about these offer up REAL TANGIABLE FIGURES ? ? ? <p> Hi Innes , The return is dependant on the amount of sun ! But follow these workings they will be pretty close . <p> So a 4kW system will produce approximately 3320kWh per year if they are south facing ( although slightly less if east or west ) . For every one of these units , you get paid the Feed in tariff for producing the electricity this currently is 13.39p / kWh . Therefore you will receive a payment of -444 per year from this . <p> The next thing to consider is the electricity bill savings electricity costs about 13.5p / kWh to buy from suppliers so if you can use all the electricity you produce ( remember solar panels only produce electricity during the day and they make a lot more in the summer compared to the winter ) , you are looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to use it all , but there are mechanisms that allow you to do this including behavioural changes and taking any excess to your immersion unit on your hot water tank . <p> Finally , you also get paid an export tariff however solar PV systems rarely have export meters installed , instead the Government halves the kWh generated and pays you the export tariff on this ( basically they assume you export 50% ) . The export tariff as of 1st May 2015 is 4.85p / kWh , so this pays you -80 based on generating a total of 3320kWh ( the workings for this are 3320 x 0.5 x 0.0485 ) . <p> So taken together this gives you a figure of near enough -1,000 so that is why people quote those figures ! <p> The Feed-in tariff payment ( including both the Generation tariff and the export tariff ) are both paid quarterly so money actually comes to you .

While the term green roof ' may also refer to that of a renewable install occurring on a roof , here we take the literal meaning of it being vegetation . <h> What are the benefits of a green roof ? <p> Green roofs have several purposes and benefits , ranging from cost savings to environmental impact . The obvious benefits include more organic matter that can improve environmental quality , reduce the risk of flash floods caused by stormwater run off and the creation of a habitat for wildlife . <p> However , the hidden benefits can often be more important and merit the install altogether .

Retro-fitting a property with a green roof is often not possible , or additional costs are required to strengthen the existing structure . Although introducing a new habitat for wildlife is seen as a benefit , it may attract unwanted pest insects that can enter the home . <h> The different types of Green Roof <p> There are three main types of green roofing , intensive and extensive . The intensive is for much larger installs , supporting around 100+ pounds of vegetation per sq foot , compared with only 20 pounds for the extensive . They require a lot more maintenance and can include small bushes and trees . These intensive roofs are often found on large commercial buildings and can often represent a park . <p> Extensive roofs are much thinner , and as they only support vegetation such as grass and moss they are self maintaining and require hardly any maintenance .

Automated systems are available and the extent of watering that is needed is decided on the plant species and the amount of matter . <p> Extensive roofs require a slightly different approach . The amount of artificial watering that is required depends on the type of vegetation , aspect , location and slope of the roof .

The Government has committed to reducing carbon emissions 57% by 2030 on 1990 levels . More efficient heating systems and better- insulation means less heating required by tenants . Some current forms of energy generation are carbon-heavy and therefore lowering energy demand is better for the environment . <p> Good news for tenants because they 're the ones paying the bills . Living in a very inefficient house means more money spent on heating therefore it is worthwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures . <p> Although enforced home improvements may not be the most welcome news for landlords , it should be seen by them as a value-adding opportunity . Tenants and property developers- will often take the EPC rating of the property into account before renting or buying . <h> What is an EPC ? <p> An EPC Energy Performance Certificate measures the energy efficiency of a property . A survey is carried out , looking at things like heating systems , insulation and the effectiveness of windows and doors in blocking draughts . The property is then given a rating between A and G. The whole process normally only takes a couple of hours . The more efficient the property , the earlier in the alphabet the letter you- are given . <p> A report is issued alongside which gives suggestions on how to improve your rating .

Pricier measures could include- getting a new boiler , double glazing or having external wall insulation fitted . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landlord in breach of the standards for fewer than 3 months will be liable to pay 10% of the propertys rateable value from a minimum of -5,000 up to a maximum of -10,000 . <p> Any landlord in breach of the standards for more than 3 months , the penalty rises to 20% of the rateable value of the property from a minimum of -10,000 to a maximum of -150,000 . <p> From April 2023 , the new MEES regulations will apply to all lettings even existing ones ( apart from those listed below ) . For more information on any of this , click- here . <p> A small piece of advice - steer clear of default- values for technologies or energy saving measures in your home - it can sometimes be difficult to find the exact information on the model of boiler we have , for instance , or the double glazing . But estimating often leaves you with a lower rating than if you had input the real information .

Give your EPC assessor some notice that you need help finding this information before lodging the EPC . <h> Which properties are exempt from MEES ? <p> Clearly , properties which do not require an EPC will not be liable for these fines . Those that will be let for less than 6 months i.e. holiday let 's do not need to meet the minimum requirement. - It can , however , benefit both landlords and holiday makers to have warm , efficient homes. - Landlords will pay lower bills and pass on fewer costs to the visitors , and holiday tenants will be more comfortable . <h> Getting a commercial EPC <p> Need a commercial EPC ?

A good place to start is your loft . Generally , most household heat is lost through the windows and roof . As heat rises , 25% of heat energy leaves through the roof . Insulating a roof can be a DIY job . <p> Insulating walls can also be effective . Modern houses ( built since 1930 ) have cavity walls . This means there is a space between the internal and external walls , which can be filled . This is a straightforward process- it is pumped into the walls- but has to be done by an expert . <p> Obviously , the catch with interior wall insulation is that it encroaches on the size of your rooms .

You can learn more about the Feed-in Tariff by clicking here , but basically it was a payment made by the Government for producing electricity with solar panels . Initially the FiT- was extremely generous , with each unit of electricity produced by the solar panels being worth approximately 43 pence . Compare this to buying a unit of electricity from the grid ; you pay about 10 " 12 pence at the moment . <p> The reason for the generosity of the Feed-in Tariff was to help people cover the installation costs of the solar panels on their roof . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 years of operation , so for 25 years the household would receive 43 pence for every unit of electricity produced by the solar system on their roof . This made the payback extremely quick ( just 6-8 years in most cases ) and then the household would still benefit from the free electricity and continued payments . <p> As time went on , the Feed-in Tariff was cut . The first big cut was on the 3rd March 2011 , when the FiT was cut from 43 pence down to 21 pence " still generous , especially when you take in to account the cost of getting solar panels installed on your property had all but halved in that time ! Since then , the FiT has continued to decrease ( it is now just 4.19 pence per kWh of electricity produced " so roughly a tenth of what it was just 5 years ago ) , but certainly when the levels of payment were higher there were a huge number of companies out there offering free solar panels . <h> Why did companies offer free solar panels ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homeowners made use of the- free electricity the panels generated and the installers took the Feed-in Tariff payments . Loads of people snapped up this arrangement A Shade Greener , one of the biggest companies offering free solar panels , installed over 67,000 solar systems ! <p> Obviously for solar installers to offer the free solar panels , there were a few conditions to be met- " the most important thing was that the solar panels were always producing electricity ( when the sun was shining ) . For example , if the household needed to remove the panels for a period to do repairs , they would have to compensate the company for any loss of FIT income . There was a benefit though ; since the install companies wanted panels to keep producing electricity , " if any issues occurred with the panels ( i.e. inverter blowing ) , then they would act very quickly to get the system back up and running . <h> Why might someone want to remove free panels ? <p> The contracts tend to last for the full term of the Feed-in tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property during the term of the FiT , - the potential buyers ( and banks offering mortgages ) need to be happy with the arrangement since they would need to keep the panels in place on the roof . <p> We are sure this is going to become a more and more common situation , especially since the terms of the Feed-in contract were quite so long ( 25 years originally , although now just 20 years ) . In fact , it was a few years ago that the Council of Mortgage Lenders ( CML ) and RICS ( Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors ) issued warnings that people could face problems when selling their home when free solar panels were installed . <p> Likewise , issues could also rear their heads when homeowners are looking to re-mortgage their properties , with some mortgage providers running miles when the term solar lease is mentioned . <p> Just this week , we have had an email from a son whose mother has sadly just passed away " he is having real problems selling her property due the presence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract the panels ca n't be removed . <p> The only real solution is to find a buyer who is willing to take on the contract , or pay the install company to get out of the contract . Not quite the free electricity ' deal that was signed up to originally . <p> Do you have free solar panels ? How have they worked for you ? Would you recommend this scheme to friends " let us know your thoughts below ! <h> 12 comments <p> Absolute rip off , I 'm trying to extend my property and cant get the funding from lenders because of the solar panels , Solar Sun 9 have written back saying its nothing to do with them so tough luck .

Can I make a legal claim of ownership <p> I got mine from a firm called Norton ( who then went bust ) via the Govt scheme at the time I think -I am now having problems with the Company who took over Norton SLS and their Lawyers .

The best solution is to shut them off completely the new owners ( if any ) who bought your lease from the dissolved company will then see that your panels are not reporting and should contact you to see why . The new owners benefit from the feed-in tariff , so need to make their money , so non-reporting units need to be looked at . It could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( may be to go through a calendar month reporting cycle ) , but when they do youll then have the new details . <p> You may have to switch them off for longer , but hopefully at least within a month they should contact you ( just keep them off for as long as possible ) . <p> It can be a mine-field , especially with the scheme being widely available to anyone that wanted to start a business with good credit ! The government should have vetted these companies more , or foreseen some issues down the line very poor indeed . <p> The company that installed them were Ideal Solar 4U . The leases were then acquired by Ecovision.I am very disappointing by the whole thing as not only as its devalued my house ( by -15K because of this lease ) , but it also will make it selling a real pain because the buyer has to accept the solar agreement is there , but also go through a mortgage company that agrees they are fine with the lease . Another issue I had was re-mortgaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it cost me about -1K more over a year being on my old mortgage ! <p> I need to get out of this contract one way or another and don ; t see why I should pay anything at all , namely because its devalued my house and for the issues I 've had tracking the new owners ( who are actually making money out of my misery ) . <p> Any help anyone has with specialist help in getting out of the contract would be gratefully received ! <p> This is such an issue qe have just lost a buyer for our home because of this type of agreement . I have seen in many discussion forums that others have experienxes the same problems although the solar company deny this ! And proactively claim that this type of arrangement can help you sell your property what a load of rubbish ! ! ! Mis-selling rouge trader tactics spring to mind here ! .

We did not have a mortgage then and decided to apply for equity release , to help our children out , in July 2016 . We were using a well known company and initially were told that we had to have property deeds altered to have both our names listed before our application could go forward . We did as requested and then an application was made to a company who would agree to lending on a property with leased solar panels . Then the fun began . The deed of variation issued by the original company was not correct . We could not find a contact address so went via the local panel maintenance company to request current phone number . We were then contacted by the operations manager of another solar panel company . The company that we had the agreement with had been dissolved and taken over by another of 12 companies registered at Companies House . We were not informed of the transfer but were told that it was quite a common occurrence ! We informed him that their deed of variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ti provide an acceptable deed of variation that the new company could copy ! , The mortgage broker explained that another solar panel company had worked with the mortgage company to produce an acceptable deed of variation so a copy of that was sent to our solar provider . The deed was altered and returned to me to send to the mortgage broker . Refused again . Could anyone give me advice on what to do ? We have a house which is unmortgageable and will need to sell in the near future to provide care fees . I have already contacted the Law Society but they are not able to help directly and have advised to find a specialist solicitor . Does anyone know of a relevant solicitor to contact ? Any help would be appreciated .

They are efficient , take up little space , and can heat your hot water as well . So , what are some of the pitfalls and problems that come with an ASHP installation ? <h> Quality of ASHP unit <p> Just like with boilers , there are good quality units and there are bad quality units . ASHPs can be quite expensive , and that can lead the consumer to go for a lower-quality product . Furthermore , because the market is- fairly new and people do n't  necessarily know the best brand names , it is easier to fool the customer into thinking they are getting a good quality system when perhaps they are not . <p> Low-quality ASHP units can come with plenty of problems . They tend to have smaller heat exchangers more liable to freezing in British winters . This can lower the efficiency of the heat pump as it tries to defrost itself . Better quality units designed for the British market have larger heat exchangers which are designed to avoid- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <h> Siting the heat pump <p> The heat pump needs to be sited in the right spot . If sited incorrectly , the efficiency will likely be much lower , as the air that is released from the heat pump is drawn back in the other side . The other thing is noise they are n't that bad , but we have heard stories of neighbours taking issue with them , so do yourself a favour and keep them happy . Make sure the pump is sited away from your neighbours house just in case . <h> Quality of installer <p> Being a relatively new technology , there are plenty of cowboys out there who do n't know what they are doing . Make sure you use only MCS-accredited installers for this kind of work , and do your due diligence to ensure the installer has good feedback from other customers . <h> Inappropriate property for ASHP <p> You can have a perfectly installed heat pump , but if the property is draughty and poorly insulated , the heat pump is never going to get the property up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and radiators sufficiently sized . This is something that an installer should check as part of the initial survey , but make sure that this is checked one way or another ! <p> Its also very easy to get suckered into getting a heat pump when your property is on the gas grid and it would actually be cheaper to run off a gas boiler . Even though heat pumps are one of the most efficient ways to heat with electricity , they are still more expensive than using a gas boiler . This is because the price of gas is around 3-4 times cheaper than electricity , and any efficiency gains from the heat pump will not- be enough to compete with the low cost of gas . We only usually recommend heat pumps for those off the gas grid . <h> Claim your RHI <p> For those who are aware of the Renewable Heat Incentive , this part is obvious .

It can be difficult to know how to heat it , and the fact it is built from glass means it does n't  retain heat well. - Aside from being expensive for your bills , and potentially attracting damp , it is pretty frustrating not to be able to sit comfortably in a part of your own home . Too cold in the winter , too hot in the summer ; it can be really difficult to reach a balance . <p> Obviously , glass is nothing like as good at insulating as solid walls , so hot air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold air can get in from outside .

There are things you can do to offset some of the problems though ; were going to run you through a couple here . <h> Insulate your conservatory ceiling <p> A modern method of increasing the energy efficiency of your conservatory is to attach insulation to the inside of the roof . Clearly , you will lose some of the natural light entering your conservatory , but it will still come through the walls , and you will be able to create a more comfortable environment . Insulating drastically reduces the amount of heat that can pass through a surface , and because heat rises , ceiling insulation is a measure that can make a real difference . As well as keeping your conservatory warmer in the winter months , it will also stop some of the thermal gain from sunlight hitting your roof in the summer , meaning the room will not overheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> First , battens are fixed to the inside of the roof . Quilted foil insulation is then added between battens , and more battens are attached on top of this . Finally , it is all covered with plasterboard and skimmed with plaster , to create a smooth surface for painting. - Ventilation must be added to ensure the insulation does n't  encourage damp , by allowing condensation to collect between surfaces . <p> Its a relatively cheap and quick process , and wont cause much disruption to the household . <p> The insulation works as a barrier to prevent heat rising through the glass ceiling . In fact , the measure can reduce heat loss from the conservatory from 90% to as little as 10%. - It also stops sunlight causing the room to overheat . <p> For help finding a local installer for the measure , fill in the contact form at the bottom of the page . <h> Install infrared heating <p> The main issue with conservatories is that their temperature is badly affected by draughts . Normal convection heating ( i.e. radiators ) heats the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conservatories . Because infrared heats via ( safe ) radiation instead , its easier to reach a certain temperature and maintain it . Infrared heat rays heat the fabric of the building , and its contents , directly . <h> From -419.99 <p> Herschels Aspect heater is a great option . Its a stylish and discreet bar heater that can be placed on the wall and will direct heat down and outwards , heating the floor , the furniture and you ! This thermal mass will then stay warm and continue to radiate heat , even after the heaters are turned off . You will feel radiant heat even if draughts enter the conservatory , because infrared is a completely different , more direct form of heating . You can also get portable infrared heaters for extra boosts of heat when sitting there on a cold day . <p> It goes without saying that your conservatory will never be the warmest room in your home , but if you want to heat it , infrared definitely makes the most sense . <p> Interested in having your conservatory insulated ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are kiloWatt-hours and what is the cost per mile of an electric car ? <h> July 11 , 2017 <p> Prices correct as of July 2017 <p> When you 're thinking about buying an electric car , you 'll hear lots of technical terms bandied around . You may get told , for instance , that a car will cost a certain amount to run per kiloWatt-hour . This might not mean much to you or me ! What does it mean in real terms ? <h> What is a kWh ? <p> A kiloWatt-hour is the most common unit for measuring electricity usage . Watts have- been used for a long time to measure the electricity requirement of lights and appliances , and the kWh ( 1000Watts ) is now used to measure the efficiency of electric car models . Roughly speaking , the cost per kWh in an electric car is the equivalent of what you pay per litre for petrol or diesel at the pumps with a normal car . In- practical terms , the way to explain the cost of kiloWatt-hours used by electric cars goes something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you pay for one hour of electricity from the National Grid . The average price per unit ( kWh ) is 12.5p , but it depends on your tariff and provider . <p> The second is the size of your cars battery in kWh . The larger the capacity of your electric cars battery ( in kWh ) , the further it will be able to go before recharging . But it will take longer to charge in the first place ! <h> So how much does it cost to charge an electric car ? <p> To work out- the charging costs of an electric car , simply multiply the cost of electricity per unit- ( kWh ) by the battery capacity of the model in kW . <p> Let 's take the example of a standard single-rate electricity tariff and a mid-range electric car ( Renault Zoe ) : <p> 12p x 41kWh = 492 <p> This means a total home charging cost ( to full battery capacity ) of -4.92 . <h> How does this cost per kWh compare to cost per litre for a normal petrol car ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of petrol per litre- and multiply it by the size of the fuel tank in this case , we have taken the example of a 45l Renault Clio . <p> -1.19 x 45l = -53.55 <p> So a full tank of petrol will cost you -50 , but a full charge of an electric battery will cost a fiver . <p> Its worth saying at this point that you cant really compare like-for-like , as the range ( i.e. how far a car will get before requiring re-fuelling/recharging ) is different for petrol and electric cars . The majority of petrol cars have a range of around 2-3 times that of an electric car . Costs per mile are difficult to estimate because of the wide number of variables that affect them . Clearly , how long exactly this 41kWh lasts/how far it gets you depends on your driving speed and the load of the car , among other things . So the real-life range will be different from the one specified by the manufacturer . This aside , - there is still a big difference in the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out far cheaper per mile . <h> Cost per mile of electric cars <p> To work out the cost per mile to run an electric car , you divide the cost of charging per mile by the range of the car . If we round up the -4.92 charging cost for the Renault Zoe above , and use the manufacturers specified range ( 250 miles ) , we get : <p> 5/250 = 0.2p per mile . <p> Compare this to the cost per mile of the petrol car above ( more than -1 ) and you can see why electric cars are known for their efficiency ! <p> As mentioned above , real costs would probably be slightly higher , because this range assumes full efficiency , but hopefully we 've explained why electric cars are a cheap option , at least in terms of running costs . These could be reduced even further if the battery was charged at- off-peak times with an Economy 7 or time of use tariff. - The cheapest way to charge an electric car is at home , and the easiest way of doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Installing an electric car- charging point <p> Interested in having shortly ! <p> Interested in having a home EV charging point installed ? 184572 @qwx384572 184569 @qwx384569 184566 @qwx384566 <h> Can I get an air source heat pump if I live on the coast ? <h> July 6 , 2017 <p> A few people have asked us- whether it is possible to have an air source heat pump if they live- near the coast . This might seem an odd question at first , but there are good reasons to be- careful when considering getting an air source heat pump on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumps are a great way to heat an off-grid property . They are usually cheaper to run than an oil boiler or electric heating , plus you will receive government Renewable Heat Incentive payments . <p> Normally , you wont have any problems running a heat pump , but if you live by the coast , you need to be aware that an air source heat pump is particularly vulnerable to corrosion from the salty air . Any property within 4 miles of the coast should be aware of this issue and your installer should be informing you and letting you know your options . <h> Avoiding corrosion with coastal heat pumps <p> Whilst corrosion can be a real issue for coastal heat pumps , there is a solution . There are protective coatings that can be applied to the heat pump to avoid corrosion . These are applied at the time of installation and may need touching up over the life of the unit . This is a simple and effective way to avoid expensive repairs and ensure the longevity of the heat pump unit . <h> Sizing coastal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more exposed , and so the heat pump will usually need to be sized slightly larger to accommodate the additional heat loss associated with the location . This is not a reason to avoid having a heat pump , but it is important that the system is sized correctly as an undersized pump will not get your home up to temperature . <h> Locating your heat pump <p> The location of your heat pump is really important . This is true for any heat pump , whether on the coast or inland , but we feel it is important to emphasise . Heat pumps need to be away from walls and fences , and need to allow good air flow around them . If this is not the case , air can leave the unit and go back into the intake . This lowers efficiency and is therefore something you 'll want to avoid . <h> Getting a heat pump on the coast <p> If you are worried about the lifespan of an air source heat pump in your locality , it might be a good idea to look at alternatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source heat pumps take their heat from the ground rather than the air , there is no danger of corrosion .

Instead the car giant will be adding electric battery technology to all cars built . <p> Volvo is looking to introduce a portfolio of electrified cars across its model range , embracing fully electric cars , plug-in hybrid cars and mild hybrid cars . Between 2019 and 2021 , it will launch 5 fully electric cars , 3 of which will be Volvo models and the other 2 will come via their high-performance car arm , Polestar . This announcement represents perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional car makers , in the move towards electrification .

The benefits of electric cars are becoming more widely known , and the market will only increase. - A quarter of UK carbon emissions- are from road transport , petrol and diesel cars are increasingly unpopular since the VW emissions scandal . Manufacturers and potential buyers are currently supported by generous government grants to help EU countries reach ambitious carbon reduction targets for tackling climate change and urban air pollution . <p> This announcement also comes on the back of battery prices dropping dramatically ( as a result of mass production ) and it seems the fabled $100/kWh price is only months away ! <p> Where once electric cars were a gimmick , they are now an attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mean for the petrol car market ? <p> Volvo estimate that by 2025 they will have sold 1m electrified cars ( either hybrid or full electric ) .

More people know them by their common name : the air conditioning unit . In the UK , they are more often found in offices than in the home , but they are becoming more popular for domestic properties , particularly in new builds . The difference with modern heat pumps is that they can actually heat a property , as well as cool- it . <p> The unit works by taking in heat from the outside air . This heat is amplified using a compressor and then released into the home . With an air to water heat pump , the heat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through radiators or underfloor heating . With- air to air heat pumps , warm air is emitted directly from the unit . <p> Of course , with an air to air heat pump , you will need to have ducting around the house to allow the air to circulate . With an air to water system , a conventional radiator or underfloor system will be required . <h> Are air to air heat pumps good for domestic properties ? <p> Air to air heat pumps are a very efficient way to heat a property . That is why many larger commercial buildings will use a heat pump with integrated ducting to condition a property . They also have the added advantage of being able to cool during the summer and heat during the winter , where central heating systems do not . <p> Air to air is often not practical for domestic properties because of the additional ducting required , but for a large scale retrofit or new build , it could be a viable option . Using warm air to heat a home is actually really efficient and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must remember that whilst air to air heat pumps are pretty efficient , they are usually more expensive to run than a gas central heating system because of the relative price of gas to electricity . We usually recommend sticking with gas central heating if that is available where you live , if cost is the major consideration . <p> One more thing to remember is that an air to air heat pump will not heat your hot water , whereas an air to water pump can be used to help heat your hot water too . This can save money because immersion heating of hot water is very expensive . <h> How much do air to air heat pumps cost ? <p> Because central heating is not required , air to air heat pumps will actually cost less to install than an air to water equivalent . The more difficult part of the installation is working out how to include the ducting , as this is not normally considered in a home heating installation . Depending on the size of the property , you will likely be looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of the ducting . <h> Are there any grants for heat pumps ? <p> The governments Renewable Heat Incentive is available for air to water and ground source heat pumps , but not available for air to air pumps . The RHI pays out a few thousand pounds over 7 years following the installation of an air to water heat pump , so it may be worth going for this option once you have crunched the numbers . <p> There are currently no government grants available for air to air pumps . <h> Air to air vs. air to water heat pumps <p> As we have touched on , there are a couple of factors you need to consider when deciding between the two , so we have made a list of pros and cons for you to help decide : <h> Air to air <p> Cheaper to install than air to water , dependent on the cost of ducting . <p> Provides excellent conditioning of rooms and heats quicker than radiators <p> Can also be sued to cool property as well as heat . <h> Air to water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook up to existing radiators or underfloor in most cases <p> Can heat your hot water as well as central heating <p> So we hope this has helped you work out what is right for your property .

A qualified assessor visits your property and- looks at every- aspect of the building and the systems within it and gives it a rating from A-G , with A being the most efficient property possible . The survey can be done in as little as an hour , and afterwards you can- be sent a personalised recommendations report , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the property . This considers things- like the heating system and how much insulation the property has , and how installing or updating them could improve your rating . <p> EPCs can be split into two categories domestic and commercial and its a legal requirement to have an EPC of a certain rating if you are renting out a property ; but more and more people are choosing to get an EPC on their own home . Let us explain why ! <h> Commercial EPC <p> Getting an- EPC every ten years has been a legal requirement for every rented property since 2007 , but stricter guidelines have recently been brought in. - The new Minimum Energy Efficiency Standards ( MEES ) require your property to have a rating of E or above on your EPC . If not , the- landlord will not be allowed to let the property , and will be liable to pay a fine of up to -150,000 . Ensuring properties are not hugely inefficient has two benefits : ensuring some level of protection for tenants against high energy bills , and reducing carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to take EPC ratings into consideration . A more energy efficient property means cheaper bills for those living in the property , - and happy tenants are more likely to pay their rent on time ! It also means- less work for property developers if you ever come to sell . Therefore , if you 're looking to sell or rent out your property , its worthwhile making sure it has the- best chance of a good rating . All potential tenants and buyers- are legally entitled to see this information before making any decisions . <h> Domestic EPC <p> Although not required by law , getting a domestic EPC is a great way to get to grips with how you could make your home more efficient . Knowing the best ways to improve your homes energy efficiency can be a bit alienating for the ordinary homeowner , so its useful to have a guide of what to think about. - If you make the changes suggested ( some of which , like insulation , are fairly cheap ) , you could find it cuts your bills significantly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic EPC normally only costs around -50 and the benefits are clear cheaper energy bills , a warmer home and the knowledge that you are reducing your carbon footprint ! <h> Getting an EPC <p> Need an EPC ?

The national rollout scheme originally intended to be completed in 2020 is now encountering more problems , with fears that rising costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rollout delayed <p> The rate of installations needs to increase , as its been much slower than first hoped. - Up to 7 million smart meters have been installed to date in the UK , of the 53 million originally intended by 2020. - The cost to suppliers of rolling out the scheme is rising , as many customers have been harder to persuade than expected . <p> Due to a lack of clear advice , a lot of people fail to see the benefits of having a smart meter installed especially as it basically means taking a day off work . Scaremongering has n't  helped , with theories circulating about ulterior motives for collecting customers usage information ! - Momentum has also been halted by serious technical issues , as some peoples meters have stopped working after switching supplier , despite repeated assurances otherwise . <h> Rising costs of smart meters <p> There has been a lot of criticism that the scheme has been badly run and suggestions it should be be paused and reconsidered , before costs spiral further . The cost per household of having a smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative costs from chasing hard-to-reach customers . Although householders wo n't shoulder the whole cost of installation , a fraction will be passed on to them via their energy bills exactly how much- remains to be seen . <p> The increased cost per household has been blamed in part for the big six energy companies recently rising bills . If bill payers end up shouldering higher costs for installation , it will contradict promises made by the government , further fueling- mistrust . <h> What 's next for smart meters ? <p> The government included its commitment to smart meters in the Queens Speech to Parliament . There was a veiled admission of defeat in the subtle change of wording used ; there 's now only a promise to offer a smart meter to every household by 2020 . This buys them more time to ( hopefully ) iron out all the problems Something that might worry some people is the fact that the Queens Speech also mentioned the possibility of smart meter regulations being changed in the future . <p> Many already have fears over how data will be stored and used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  collect any more data than ordinary meters , and energy companies cant share it unless you give them explicit permission . <p> Importantly , no-one will be forced to have a smart meter installed but there is still a lot of hope for their benefits , provided current issues are resolved . Proponents say that the positives of smart meters will mean they pay for themselves in the future , but in order for the benefits to be realised , the majority of UK residents need to be persuaded to co-operate . The government and energy companies have a lot to do to reassure people and encourage them that getting a smart meter is in their best interests . <p> Have you had a smart meter installed ? Do you think they are a good thing , or an expensive mistake for the UK ? - <h> What to think about when installing solar panels <p> Solar panels are a popular choice for those wanting to generate their own electricity . They 're relatively quick to install , easy to maintain , and can save you money while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider when thinking about installing them , though " we are going to run you through some of these . <p> The three main things to think about : <p> The roof you install the solar PV system on should ideally face between south-east and south-west . <p> The inverter ( which changes the direct current generated into alternating current to be used by domestic appliances ) should be placed close to the PV panels , to minimise transmission losses . <p> The roof should not be prone to overshading from trees or other buildings . <h> Placement/angle <p> Be careful about the placement of your panels . Although solar PV panels are at their most efficient when facing south , they will still generate some electricity in other generations but not as much . It 's worth taking this into account when thinking about whether or not your home is suitable . North-facing orientations should be avoided . <p> The angle of the panels is also really important . A mid-point between horizontal and vertical " such as a typical UK house roof at around 32- will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , so the minimum tilt you need to allow rain to wash away dust is 15- off horizontal . If your array will be facing east or west , a shallower tilt angle will work better , as the sun is lower in the sky as it moves away from due south . If you have a flat roof , you can mount panels on frames and angle them where they will get the best yield possible . <p> You can get an automatic- solar tracker , which moves your panels to make sure they are always facing the sun . However , these are more expensive and do n't  perform as well as their stationary counterparts in harsh weather conditions . <h> Shadowing <p> Shadows have a big impact on the performance of solar panels . If your panels are even slightly shaded by large trees or nearby buildings , they will not work as effectively . This is because solar panels are connected into strings and even- if only one cell in a string is blocked , the output of the other panels in the string drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheat this to a certain extent by arranging modules so that shadows will affect one whole string if possible , rather than the end cell of multiple strings . <h> Inverter <p> Solar panels produce electricity in direct current ( DC ) , which needs to be converted into alternating current ( AC ) before it can be used in the home . Systems include an inverter for this reason , and to work at maximum efficiency , it should be installed as close to the panels as possible . Most choose to place it in the loft.The placement of your diverter is also important if you are hoping to claim Feed in Tariff payments . <p> It 's well worth doing your research to find a good solar PV installer , as they 'll know- all the above and will be able to ensure that it is taken into account . <h> Optional extras for maximum efficiency <h> Solar PV diverter <p> Installing a solar PV diverter will make sure you maximise savings on your bills , by allowing you to use as much of your self-generated electricity as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels that is not used straight away is sent to the National Grid , and you 'll have to pay to import electricity like anyone else- at times when the sun is n't shining . If you install a diverter , it sends surplus electricity you do n't  use to your immersion heater , meaning you 'll save money on water heating . <h> Solar PV battery storage <p> You could even go one further and install a solar battery storage system although itll cost you . This allows you to store the electricity you generate , to be used whenever you want it , leaving you less reliant on national energy stores , and cutting your bills even further- as a result . <h> Installing solar PV <p> Are you thinking about installing shortly ! <p> Interested in getting a solar PV system installed ? 184572 @qwx384572

@@36749200 @5749200/ <h> January 15 , 2013 <h> 2012 Positives in the UK <p> The year just- passed- showed some encouraging signs for renewables in the UK ; Installed capacity was up almost 25% from 2010 to 2011 topping 12,000MW . In September , early figures for 2012 showed this figure exceeding 14,000MW . Mainstays of the UK renewables mix continued to see considerable upticks in capacity , but microgeneration has also made forward strides , with ever more solar panels and micro wind turbines seen in domestic settings .

Politically there were negatives as well , the COP18 in Doha once more struggled to progress global climate talks and on a national level , the Government has signalled its intention to focus on natural gas as a solution to the looming energy gap the country will face by 2015 . <p> For those unaware , the UK is closing several of its coal fired power stations in the coming years , to fall in line with EU emissions regulations . It means that by 2015 , energy capacity of the grid will not be sufficient to deal with peak demand . It is a pressing problem , which has prompted the government to look at importing gas to resolve the situation . Unfortunately natural gas only offers a small reduction in carbon emissions compared to coal , and the lack of a local supply means the UK will be relying on imports from other parts of the world like Russia and will be exposed to both volatile prices and political pressures . <h> Fuel Poverty and the Rising Cost of Energy <p> The rising cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of the major energy companies hiked their prices well above inflation and the number of people in fuel poverty increased dramatically , with some surveys suggesting as many as a quarter of households have to choose between food and warmth during the winter months . <p> This is where new Government initiatives like the Green Deal will come into play . Aimed at those who can not afford to pay for expensive energy efficiency measures up front , the scheme allows consumers to install measures and pay back the initial cost with the savings made . Energy efficiency has a huge role to play in both meeting carbon reduction targets and cutting energy use and hopefully the Green Deal will help deliver these aims on both a residential and commercial perspective . The Energy Company Obligation , designed to work where the Green Deal will not , will replace the Warm Front scheme , helping to provide energy efficiency measures for low income households . <h> Can Adversity Breed Change ? <p> The flooding experienced during 2012 was unprecedented and many fear that climate change will mean these sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet perhaps it can help change public opinion as well ; it is a well known phenomenon that people tend not to change their lifestyles until it affects them directly .

This gets compressed , raising the temperature , before being fed into a heat exchanger which transfers the heat into water and is pumped around your heating system . Its an efficient form of heating because the conversion rate of electricity into useful heat is higher than with radiators . You therefore get more out for what you pay in , saving you money on your energy bills ! <p> Ground source heat pumps will not be suitable for every property because the installation process involves drilling large bore holes either vertically or horizontally for pipework .

We cant give a definite answer on this , because the cost of systems and the rates paid by the scheme- vary greatly depending on your home and change from year to year . <h> Ground source heat pump costs <p> The Energy Saving Trust estimates the cost of installing a ground source heat pump at between -13,000-20,000 . <p> We used the online RHI calculator to work out estimated payments- for installing ground source heat pumps in two example properties .

Its worth noting , however , that this is just an estimate ! Clearly , the figure given- falls short of the amount of installation possibly by quite a bit . Its also- not a one-off payment : it is now only paid out over the course of 7 years , in quarterly instalments . This- relies on you having the initial capital to invest , as you will be paid back over such a long time . You will be shouldering the cost for years . <p> Example property number 2 <p> In England/Wales <p> Semi-detached <p> Built since 2007 <p> 3 bedrooms <p> Insulated cavity walls <p> Thick loft insulation <p> Post-2005 LPG/gas boiler <p> According to this example , RHI payments would only total -7,000- over 7 years .

@@36749202 @5749202/ <h> Pros and Cons of Onshore Wind Turbines <h> March 7 , 2013 <h> UK Onshore Wind Turbines <p> In this weeks blog we are going to look at the advantages of onshore wind turbines . In the UK , wind energy plays a significant role in our energy mix , providing enough electricity to power 4.5m homes in total . <p> Onshore wind has an installed capacity of 5,619MW , roughly twice that of offshore wind , and produces about 13,000GWh of electricity , enough to power about 3m homes per year . <p> There has been lots of press attention recently over the role of wind turbines in our energy mix , so we are going to weigh up what we see as the potential advantages and disadvantages of this form of renewable technology . <h> Advantages of Onshore Wind Turbines <h> It is a proven Technology <p> It is already helping provide a significant amount of electricity to the grid . In 2010 , onshore electricity provided about 7TWh of electricity to the grid , approximately 25% of the renewable energy in the energy mix in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as high as 30TWh by 2020 . <h> It is comparatively Cheap <p> Onshore Winds primary advantage is that it is the cheapest renewable energy source currently available to the UK , working out at about 8p / kWh . This puts it slightly more expensive that gas and the other more established fossil fuels which come in about 4-7p / kWh , but is substantially lower than situating the turbines out at sea . <h> It is quick to install <p> While a nuclear power station might take in excess of 20 years to construct from the initial planning permission phase , a wind turbine can go up and start providing electricity to the grid in a matter of months . <h> Limitations of Onshore Wind Turbines <h> Not 100% Green <p> So are wind turbines completely green ? Well no , despite producing emission free electricity when in operation , they are limited emissions associated with their manufacture and installation . <h> Noise Pollution <p> Some people who live in close proximity of the wind turbines complain of the noise they make when the wind is blowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually are . <h> Eye-sore <p> Onshore wind turbines are often criticised for their visual impact , ruining what previously have been areas of natural beauty . They are typically spread out over larger areas than other energy producing installations , and therefore have a larger impact on the local environment . <h> They do n't produce electricity 24/7 <p> The other major issue with any type of wind turbine is that it produces electricity intermittently . This would n't necessarily be an issue if we could store the electricity produced when demand is very low , but energy storage is currently very inefficient , expensive and unproven . <h> The Future for Wind Turbines <p> If the cost of manufacturing wind turbines falls , then very quickly the cost per kWh of electricity produced from wind will reach parity with electricity made from burning fossil fuels . <p> Potentially , as the wind industry continues to grow , economies of scale can be introduced ( ability to make something cheaper , the more you make of it ) and the technology will become more efficient ( for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy in the wind ) so the price to produce the electricity from wind turbines will continue to fall . <p> There are initiative solutions to make renewables produce power 24/7 currently in development . The Crescent Dunes Solar power plant takes advantage of molten salt technology to keep electricity flowing while the sun does n't shine . <p> In theory , Wind Turbines could be coupled with pumped storage such as the Dinorwig power station in Wales , but even that storage mechanism is limited , and requires a lot more energy to create the electrical potential energy , than can be used for useful work . <p> Have a look at our energy storage section to see other potential solutions that make make 24/7 production viable . <p> The last point here , and the one that I think is most important , is that as people begin to grow up with wind turbines around them , they will become the norm and therefore more accepted . Currently many of the people complaining about them have seen these things installed in the last 5 years or so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . <p> Children growing up now will know no different , the wind turbines will simply be part of the furniture ' and therefore they will recognise them as what they are , simply smaller scale energy power plants . <h> 6 comments <p> Beauty is in the eye of the beholder James Arjuna and it is ridiculous to think that someone who disagrees with your version of beauty is brainwashed . How are they inefficient for the space they take up ? The land can still be farmed or used for pasture . You ca n't farm in a power station . Wind power in association with solar is the quickest and best way to reduce CO2 emissions . <p> I 'm pro wind power but your article is very disingenuous regarding noise . Decibels are not really a good measure of noise pollution as anyone with some acoustic wherewithal will know . The frequency and pattern is probably more important and less easy to measure . <p> A turbine will sound different depending on the conditions and context it certainly wont sound like a fridge or an AC unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be to live near one for a month or two or listen to those people who do live near them . <p> The biggest disadvantage is they are brainwashed into people brains because they do n't  understand electricity . If you want to stop using wasted power , then use solar panels on your house and reduce the load using DC lighting and DC equipment and go OFF grid and tell the rich elite plutocrats who sell this crap to ignorant lemmings to go sell their electricity to some other stupid person who knows nothing about science . <p> Hi James thanks for the comment . While I agree they are not everyones cup of tea , I do n't  think they are quite as bad as you are making out ! I think the major problem is that in the UK we need to increase our energy independence i.e. be less reliant on other countries for gas and oil . Wind turbines do just that , but I guess the major problem with them and many other renewables is that they are intermittent , meaning they only produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the big issue is energy storage to better meet supply and demand , but storage technology seems to be playing catchup while there are some interesting ideas out there , they all seem to be in the R&amp;D stage at the moment so it will be interesting how this area develops in the coming years . <p> Hi Alexander . thanks for commenting and point taken . But surely if you look at the paragraph in the article you will see we have appreciated the fact that a " noise " can be a problem rather than dismissing it altogether . I would also say that all forms of energy generation have their pitfalls , but if we are against every form of new generation due to a particular flaw then are we not giving ourselves a bigger headache in the ability to keep lights on going forward ? <p> i think that overall this artice is brilliant it goes into detail about the pros and cons of onshore wind turbines is covers all aspects of it and even goes into depth about the noise pollution uses statistics about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . i agree with it being relatively quick and cheap to install because they are not dependant on weather for example like the off shore turbines where they cant install them if the sea level is about 1.4 meters or if the sea is too rough 
@@36749203 @5749203/ <h> Should I get a borehole or a trench for my ground source heat pump ? <h> June 13 , 2017 <p> Ground Source Heat Pumps ( GSHP ) are a great way to heat a modern home , especially if you are off the gas grid . They do require a bit of room in the garden though , so they are n't for everyone ! <h> How does a GSHP work ? <p> Heat pumps are designed to move heat from one place to another , even when the source is colder than the room you are trying to heat ! It may seem a little counter intuitive , but heat pumps work just like your fridge or freezer , but in reverse . In a GSHP , a refrigerant liquid is pumped around pipes laid in your garden , absorbing the latent heat in the ground . This heat is then released into your home after being amplified by a compressor . <p> GSHPs are great because the temperature of the ground is pretty much constant throughout the year , unlike an air source pump , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to operate efficiently . As such , GSHPs operate at a very similar level of efficiency all year round , and will always be more efficient than an air source equivalent . <p> The trickiest and most expensive part of a GSHP installation is laying the pipework under the ground . There are 2 ways to do this . You can lay the pipes in trenches running up and down the garden ( horizontal collectors ) , or you can drill a borehole and sink the pipe way down in the ground . <p> Clearly , laying trenches is much cheaper than boreholes . Boreholes cost a small fortune to dig , and reinforcement will be required to prevent the hole from collapsing on itself . The cost of this is often -10-15k . However , there are some benefits of having the borehole . <p> Boreholes only take up a fraction of the room that trenches do , so if you only have a small garden , this is the only option for you . Further , it means you wo n't have to dig up half your garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GSHP takes up when you have to run the pipes through trenches . It really will destroy the garden . The good news is that once it is laid and finished , you wo n't be able to tell that it 's there , and you can plant your garden again . Be aware though that this land will no longer be usable for trees , driveways or ponds . The area needs to be free from large roots and must be porous . <p> Also note that to drill a borehole a very large piece of drilling machinery is required . If your garden is inaccessible to vehicles then it may not be possible to get the drill into the garden . <h> Local geology can make a difference <p> For horizontal collectors , the ground needs to hold water well to be most effective . Even at 1.5m deep which is the typical depth for a trench , the temperature can vary season to season , and the geological conditions can make the difference . Your installer should be able to advise if your property is suitable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temperature is very consistent , so you wo n't have any variation in efficiency at all between seasons . This makes borehole heat pumps great for cooling in summer , as well as for heating in winter . <h> Which is better : boreholes or trenches ? <p> This is really a tricky one to give a definitive answer to . It really will depend on the heating and cooling requirements of the property , the geology and local conditions , room available , costing and aesthetic considerations in the garden . <p> Whichever route you go down , though , ground source heat pumps are is a great way to heat your home . Remember that there is a very generous RHI grant available from the government for this type of system , and you will definitely see considerable savings on your heating costs when compared to other off grid heating like oil boilers . <h> Could I save money with a ground source heat pump ? <p> Technology <p> Expected Savings with GSHP/yr <p> Gas Boiler ( G Rated ) <p> -600 <p> Gas Boiler ( A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> -800 <p> Storage Heaters ( Modern ) <p> -500 <p> Oil boiler ( G Rated ) <p> -400 <p> Oil boiler ( A Rated ) <p> Increase of -50 <p> LPG Boiler ( G Rated ) <p> Increase of -1,100 <p> LPG Boiler ( G Rated ) <p> Increase of -400 <p> *Figures- approximated based on an average house .

With increasing frequency of heatwaves caused by global warming there are several accompanying problems for homes such as : <p> Decreased indoor air quality within the houses <p> Decreased thermal comfort of the occupants <p> Increased energy consumption for summer cooling , as a result of mechanical ventilation systems and air conditioning <h> Natural Ventilation as a Solution to Overheating and Air Quality <p> Natural ventilation focuses on the supply of outside air to reduce the internal temperature of the house and ensure good air quality . The effectiveness of natural ventilation as a cooling strategy depends on the following parameters : <p> The house location , as the houses located in the UK could achieve lower temperatures than those in warmer countries . <p> The house orientation , as the wind speed and direction could be different depending on the area and the local weather characteristics <p> The size and the location of the windows within the house <p> The volume of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need more air changes per hour to reduce the temperature within a space <p> The number of occupants and the amount of lights and electrical equipment , as more people and lights produce more heat reducing the effectiveness of natural ventilation <p> The occupant 's behaviour " this could mean things like leaving your computer on during the day , leaving your windows open and what sort of temperature you feel comfortable at . <p> The last parameter is a key factor because even the houses that have been designed to perform natural ventilation , using the minimum energy for cooling , can fail due to inappropriate occupant behavior . In order to achieve the maximum effect of natural ventilation to your house you can follow one of the next strategies depending on the layout of your house : <p> Single sided ventilation can be achieved in rooms that have a single window at just one wall .

The hot air is less dense than the cooler air so it has an upward route when the indoor temperature is more than the outside air . So , if your house has roof windows or a chimney a good way to naturally ventilate the space is to open them rather than just opening the lower windows of the house during the hot days . <p> Night ventilation is a very effective strategy during the summer months especially when the house has high thermal mass . High thermal mass components , such as the walls , the floor and the roof , can absorb large amounts of heat during summer . This mechanism keeps the house cool during a summer day .

Now although on the face of it , this sounds like the tenants are getting the rough end of the deal , in fact the main mechanism of the Green Deal means that the monthly repayments ca n't exceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tenant would be paying these costs anyway through higher energy bills . <p> This is big news because privately rented properties are on average , significantly less efficient than owner occupied properties and social housing .

Further , only 38% of private rentals had cavity wall insulation when appropriate , whereas owner occupiers were insulated in 57% of instances and social housing in 63% . So it is clear that there is significant room for straight forward , worthwhile energy efficiency improvements in the sector . <h> How exactly does the Green Deal and Rentals work ? <p> The first thing to say that is that , although the tenant may request a Green Deal Assessment , it is the Landlord ( or owner ) that must sign the credit and installation agreement , as the tenant or bill payer will not be liable for any payments after they have left the property . <p> Of course , in the vast majority of rentals , the bill payer is the tenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be repaying the loan .

This is a straight forward but important part of the process , otherwise the new tenant would be under no obligation to repay the loan whilst living at the property .

Legislation coming in for 2018 means no property can be let out with an efficiency rating of F or below . Plus from 2016 , tenants will be able to demand better insulation from their landlords . This means that it is very much in the landlord 's best interest to look at the Green Deal as a way to make their necessary energy improvements at no cost to themselves . It makes a lot of sense for them . <h> What about social rentals ? <p> Up until now , despite many sources telling us otherwise , social tenants have not been able to take out Green Deal finance .

Previously considered a fringe technology , they have now become very much a part of the UK 's energy generation policy . Today , up to 90 per cent of our energy is still generated by coal , gas and oil , and 6 per cent by nuclear ( considered a low carbon energy source ) , but the remaining 4 per cent is provided by renewable sources . This figure is set to increase significantly in the future as it becomes more important to cut carbon emissions . <h> Solar PV Efficiency <p> Passive solar power has long been used to heat water and structures , and is still popularly used today , but it was not until the 19th century that inventors turned their attention to the problem of converting sunlight into electricity .

Scientists continued to make discoveries , and in 1883 Charles Fritts developed the first photovoltaic solar cells from selenium . At this time they were roughly 2 per cent efficient . <p> Roll on several years . In the 1980s there had been numerous advances , and the efficiency of solar panels was hovering a little under 20 per cent . Today , efficiencies of over 40 per cent have been recorded in laboratories , and it may be possible to reach 50 per cent in coming years . Researchers are looking at methods such as spectrum splitting to boost efficiency . However , commercial solar panels still only have efficiencies of up to about 20 per cent . <p> In line with efficiency rises and increasing popularity and demand , solar power has seen significant price drops per watt in the last thirty years . In 1984- the cost of solar cells was about $16 per watt . This dropped steadily at a rate of about $0.6 every year for the next 20 years and in 2005 the price was just $4 per watt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in 2009 it dropped dramatically over four years to $1 in 2012 .

Like solar power , wind power has a very long history . Wind turbines designed to hook up to the electricity network began appearing around the 1980s , and advances in design continued throughout the 1990s . From the beginning of the 21st century , growth occurred at about 30 per cent per year . Major impacts on productivity have occurred through sheer scale " modern wind turbines are huge , with larger rotors than previous models . This means more wind can be captured . <p> The rising prevalence of wind turbines on our landscape in recent times has not been without controversy . But as with solar power , wind power has seen significant average price drops per watt over the last thirty years . Moreover , the productivity of wind power is higher and the price per watt is lower than that of solar energy .

@@36749227 @5749227/ <h> Introduction To Wind Turbines <h> Renewables <h> What are wind turbines ? <p> Windmills ( now in the form of wind turbines ) have been used for millennia to convert the wind 's kinetic energy into mechanical energy . As early as 200 B.C. , mechanical energy was used for specific tasks including grinding grain and pumping water. - Nowadays , wind turbines harness kinetic energy from the air and convert it- into electricity via a generator . <p> Much like- solar PV- installations , you can purchase a domestic wind turbine to supply as much or as little electricity as you want . If you are hoping to limit your dependence on the mains as much as possible , you will need a larger turbine , or multiple smaller turbines . If you are simply looking to produce enough electricity for a light in your garden shed , you can get away with a very small turbine . <p> Below we look at the different types of wind turbine system you can install in your property . <h> Battery-less grid tied systems <p> Battery-less grid tied systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbine systems . Their role is simple : to produce the most electricity possible to provide electricity for your home and also feed into the grid . Due to the availability of grants such as the- feed-in tariffs- in the- UK , this type of system has grown enormously in popularity in recent years . In these installations , the home owner can effectively sell the surplus- energy back to the utility company . There are no batteries in the system , so this removes a lot of the system complication and maintenance . The lack of batteries also makes it cheaper to install . <p> If your aim is to become completely unreliant on- the grid , then you need to ensure the electricity produced by your battery-less grid tied system is in excess of your total electricity usage for the year . However , this system should suit most budgets , because it will reduce reliance on the energy companies , by significantly reducing your bills . If you can not produce all your electricity , the shortfall is simply made up with electricity from the grid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that is that if there is a electrical- power cut- then you will have no power for your home , - because the inverter your energy goes through is connected to mains power , so you may require a generator ( powered by diesel or oil ) as a back-up policy . <h> Grid-tied system with battery backup <p> This is essentially the same as the grid-tied system- above , but has a bank of batteries which means that if there is a grid power cut , the inverter can still get the electricity it requires to operate , so the installation will keep providing you with electricity . The constraints of this system are primarily associated with the batteries , which are expensive and require regular maintenance . Finally , add extra inefficiency into the system ( ranging from 5 " 40% ) and this is added to the constraint side . <h> Off-grid systems <p> This system has no connection at all to the grid , relying instead on batteries to operate if no wind is blowing . However if the capacity of these batteries is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prolonged period of time . Having a system off-grid presents an ideal situation as you become completely independent from the grid , and you produce all the electricity you need . However , this type of system tends to be the most expensive and also is maintenance-heavy . If you have a garden shed that needs lighting then this system can work out relatively cheaply , but as soon as you are looking to upscale then it becomes very expensive . <p> In the next section we look at the components that you need for a successful wind turbine installation . <h> Benefits <p> Wind turbines allow you to produce 100% clean , free electricity . 184564 @qwx384564 <p> Wind turbines can be considered- a bit of an eyesore and often have to be limited to rural areas . <h> Cost <p> Entirely dependent- on the size of the wind turbine , from -1k -10k. <h> 2 comments <p> It is high time we harnessed the power of the wind properly .

Do they really make a difference ? And what type of excluder works best ? <h> What is the Best Draught Excluder ? <p> Anything that blocks the cold air from travelling around your doors or windows is an effective draught excluder . Remember that this is not intended to be an insulator in the way that loft insulation or wall insulation is . Insulation prevents heat from passing through it , whilst draught excluders prevent cold or warm air from passing around it . This is an important distinction , because you can have a really well insulated home with really high spec insulation in the walls , and still feel cold because there is a nasty draught coming from the front door . <p> That means that every home could probably do with some draught excluders , with the possible exception of very modern high spec doors and windows , which should be relatively air tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a huge difference to a home . <h> Should you use Draught Excluders- Between Rooms ? <p> People often ask if you should insulate partition walls , or stud walls in between rooms in your house .

Draughts between rooms can make you feel colder , even if the air itself is n't colder . Further , if you have your living room warmer than the rest of the house , draught proofing under the connecting doors will help prevent those convection type draughts as the colder air gets under the door from the adjoining room . <h> Draught Proofing Floorboards <p> If you have exposed floor boards you should make sure that the gaps between them are filled .

Why should you not block these ? There are two main reasons : Air bricks help reduce the amount of condensation forming on your walls , and therefore help deal with any potential damp issues . Vents are also important if you have gas appliances or old open flue boilers , as they ensure your boiler is getting enough air and the fuel is burning properly " so do n't block them . Modern boilers do n't have this problem as they draw their air from the outside rather than from the air in the room .

As a result , they can be costly to run , - requiring- a lot of heating to keep them at a comfortable temperature . It can even be worse when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into March , April and parts of May . The- resulting energy usage is estimated to be 15 " 20% higher than in normal years . <p> So you may have a well-insulated loft space and an efficient boiler , but you are still puzzled as to why the property is so bad at retaining heat . The answer is that uninsulated walls can account for 35% or more of the heat loss and unfortunately period properties , which are common across towns and cities , have solid brick walls that are simply terrible at retaining heat . <h> You can insulate a solid wall <p> The myth up to now has been that a solid wall can not be insulated as a retrofit project , because it does not have a cavity that can be filled . This is simply not true . Whilst cavity walls ( seen on houses post 1930 ) are definitely cheaper and easier to insulate ( as cavity wall insulation can simply be pumped into the cavity ) , there are methods available for these old solid walls to help them reach more modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall from the inside . The process entails adding insulation to the wall and then re-plastering to achieve a nice even finish. - With internal wall insulation you just need to be a bit more aware that by adding insulation , the living area will be significantly reduced . <p> The precise amount of space you lose will vary depending on- the degree of insulation . But be prepared to lose 50mm ( 2 inches at least ) to the walls that face the outside exposed walls . The good news is that you do n't  need to insulate party walls ( the shared walls between adjacent properties ) because in theory they are heating the wall from the other side , so no heat loss occurs across this . Therefore if you live in a mid-terrace property , you only need to worry about insulating the- front and the back walls of the property . <p> A more widely used method of insulating solid walls is applying external wall insulation , which is essentially thickening the walls from the outside , then sealing the system with a range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the render products , the finished walls may look different to their original appearance ( unless they are already rendered ) . The render is textured and can be coloured with any colour depending on what you want . The property can also have brick slips installed on top of the insulation to allow the property not to deviate too much from a traditional brick look . However , brick slip systems tend to be quite expensive , which makes rendered finishes more popular and widely used up and down the country. - The video below is an simplified- demonstration on how the external wall insulation process works . It does not necessarily capture all the little details , but you will see the- key layers that are applied externally to a wall . For more technical information please refer to an appropriate BBA certificate of an external wall manufacturer . <h> Solid wall insulation and aesthetics <p> Some of our readers tell us that they love the principle of external wall insulation , but they hate the reality of having to sacrifice property features to do so . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improver can potentially combine internal insulation at the front elevation ( thereby preserving features at street level ) with- external insulation on the sides and back . <p> Working around these challenges for a period property will also get you through potential local authority planning hurdles especially if you live in one- of the large metropolitan areas . For example , - London has a high proportion of listed properties and large areas that are covered by building restrictions . Therefore it is always worthwhile spending some time familiarising yourself with the rules and regulations covering your local area before you proceed on with your project . <h> What is the cost of solid wall insulation ? <p> If you were to go to an installer today and inquire about getting solid wall insulation installed , you might be quite shocked by the cost . From data- we have collected up and down the country , the price for the measure varies between -80 to -125m per m2 , depending on the property and the final finish . Internal wall insulation costing varies between -70 to -95m2 . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finishes . These range from the insulating material used ( EPS , mineral wool , cork , etc ) , to the final topcoat , which can be acrylic ( cheapest ) or silicone based , to- different types of brick slips or specialist finishes . <p> On the whole , looking purely at- economic payback through energy bill savings ( i.e. recouping the cost of installation will probably take 20 years + based on the energy savings it will provide ) , external wall insulation will not look sensible as a standalone metric . However , the external wall insulation system provides additional benefits it improves the visual appearance of an old render properties and helps waterproof and protect the walls from penetrating damp . <h> Grants and subsidies for solid wall insulation do they work ? <p> The economics of solid wall insulation as a standalone indicator did n't really work until the Government introduced the Green Deal . This was an energy efficiency scheme that was phased out in 2015 , and will probably not come back in its previous form . Some homeowners benefited from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 75% of the total cost . The scheme- did not achieve its aim of actually delivering a high- volume of external wall insulation improvements up and down the country . This was because- the rate of subsidy was set too high and was distributed by a very small number of first come first served users . <p> We believe that external wall insulation not only- lowers bills , but also adds value to the property and extends its lifespan . Therefore , if there is a future scheme- launched in some shape or form , it has to look at beyond the traditional success indicators , and- look at qualitative aims in addition to the economic arguments for it to be successful . A national scheme that is led purely by free money does not create the right incentives for the consumer , or to the industry trying to deliver it . <p> Our prediction- is that a future scheme will be based on the pay-as-you-save or home improvement loan mechanisms , with very small and targeted amounts of carbon-saving grants . This scheme may have some Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very much private-sector led . Expected launch in 2017-18 . <h> Why is the government now not subsidising the cost of solid wall insulation ? <p> The obvious point as to why the Government is not throwing any money at solid wall insulation is that it does n't  have any money ; and secondly , the cost of the measure is quite expensive , therefore requiring quite an outlay to make sure enough consumers out there can benefit from it . Therefore it is too difficult to go back down that road . <p> The Government is also trying to move away from sponsoring flagship policies ( Green Deal , Big Society , etc ) and pushing more emphasis back on the industry or non-Government sectors to do what it has always done well , which is to deliver for its customers or members . The Government does have to meet carbon reduction targets , but the popular view is that some of those will be missed by 2020 , with little worry about the political fall-out from doing so . <p> Cavity wall insulation and loft insulation are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK , and the limited ECO funding that is available is going towards some of those measures rather than solid wall insulation . <p> We are seeing only the most committed home owners or businesses go through the necessary steps to have solid wall insulation implemented on their properties . Very often it is this grouping that really understands the benefits of solid wall insulation and some of its long-term aims , that- chooses to make- the investment . 184574 @qwx384574 184572 @qwx384572 <p> We are contemplating purchasing a Gregorian property run off-gas near Newbury , and want to make it as green as possible . What Government grants can we use to make the cost worth it for us ? much obliged <p> Hi Mikhail , the GDHIF scheme is launching again in a few weeks which will give you a big grant towards the cost of solid wall insulation . In terms of heating provided the house is really well insulated you might want to consider a heat pump these run off electricity and are very efficient turning one unit of electricity into 4 units of useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heat for every unit of electricity ) . A heat pump also benefits from the Renewable heat incentive which pays you for every unit of hot water you produce ( this should cover the initial install costs ) . 
@@36749233 @5749233/ <h> Financial Incentives <h> What is the Green Deal ? <p> Unlike traditional finance schemes where the financial obligation of paying the loan back is directly on the individual who took out the loan , under the Green Deal scheme , the loan is attached instead to the electricity meter . <p> This means that should the current occupant of the property move out of the property ( e.g. sell or move out if renting ) the new occupants will be obliged to take on the Green Deal finance debt . <p> The Green Deal was set up to help improve the energy efficiency of properties across the UK , since many of the properties we live in are very inefficient , with solid walls , old heating systems and very little insulation . This scheme allows people to improve their homes without having to stump up the entire upfront costs of the works . <p> The scheme is open to every household in the UK , but there are 3 primary aims : <p> Help homeowners/tenants install energy efficiency measures , even if they are unable to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Green Deal is also aimed at those who want to increase the value of their homes through installing renewable energy or energy efficiency measures . <h> The Green Deal is finance , not a grant <p> It is worth reiterating that Green Deal finance is- not- a grant " it is finance and an example of a- pay-as-you-save energy saving scheme , where repayments are made through the energy bills . <p> If you take out Green Deal finance to help pay for the measures , your energy bill- will no longer just show the amount you spend on gas and- electricity : it will also show a finance amount . You can see in the table below- we have drawn a very crude representation of how Green Deal finance works . On the left you can see your existing energy bill ( 100% energy and gas ) . On the right you can see your new bill ( including the Green Deal finance charge which is in yellow ) . <p> The key here is that the energy bill does n't go up even after installing the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is central to how the funding mechanism works . <p> The Golden Rule is theoretical though , and actually in real life your energy bills may go and up and down slightly . The amount of funding you can get under the Green Deal is calculated via the Green Deal report , which calculates the yearly energy savings you could expect from installing the different energy saving measures . It takes this theoretical energy saving from the report and multiplies it by the lifetime of the measure you are installing . <h> A basic worked example of the Green Deal <p> The easiest way of showing this is using an example " so let 's imagine replacing an old boiler with a new energy saving boiler . <p> Take this -50 annual saving and multiply it by the lifespan of the measure you are looking to install . For boilers this is 12 years so -50 x 12 = -600 . <p> This is the total Green Deal funding you could expect to get in this example . <p> To be honest this example is pretty typical of the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of replacing a boiler here , but the cost is considerably more that the amount of finance you can get ! <p> The take-home message here is that , in most cases , unless the energy saving figures are very high on the Green Deal Report , then Green Deal finance is unlikely to cover the total cost of the works . <h> Getting more finance <p> As mentioned , one of the problems facing the green deal has always been the constraints of the golden rule . This really limits the amount of funding available for most people . Having spoken to the Green Deal Finance Company in March 2017 , they are planning on looking at changing this legislation to relax this rule . <p> The impact of this is very significant , because if the legislation can be changed then most people will be able to get their new energy efficiency measure installed all covered by the Green Deal loan . <p> In the meantime , there are two imminent changes being introduced to help maximise the funding for customers . <p> Add top up loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the person taking out the loan will be responsible for repaying it regardless of whether they sell / move out of the property in the future . <p> Installing energy saving measures with better efficiency factors . Basically this refers to the software currently in use " basically it simplifies the whole process and says that if you install a new boiler , the energy savings are the same regardless of the new boiler used . In reality , new boilers vary on efficiency " so better boilers will be more efficient and produce bigger energy savings . Soon this will be reflected in the Green Deal advice report , allowing for more funding if better energy saving measures are used . <h> Who can get the Green Deal ? <p> In theory , any home can access the Green Deal , but the scheme has been specifically tailored to the private home owner or the private rental sectors . The reason being is that the social housing sector already has several ways in which improvements are funded and undertaken " namely the ECO scheme . <p> The key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance needed to pay for the measure gets attached to the electricity meter ' within the property and therefore if the homeowner moves out , the new person coming in will take on the Green Deal . As a result of this , the measures included within the scheme are non portable ' , for example LED bulb lighting replacements and electric heaters that have plugs " both would be considered portable and therefore ineligible for the Green Deal . <h> The Green Deal Process <p> The following section talks a bit more about how the Green Deal process works end-to-end " starting with a Green Deal assessment , and ending with the energy saving measures installed in your property by a Green Deal Installer . <p> Get a Green Deal Assessment completed on your property by a certified Green Deal Assessor . This is a standalone service that requires an assessor to visit your property and undertake an assessment of how energy efficient the home is . Following the visit a Green Deal Report is produced , which lists the recommended energy efficiency measures listed as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green Deal report and decide if they are- appropriate- for you " the finance available will be based on the energy savings . There is no obligation to carry out any works ! <p> Ensure you are happy with the quote and agree the Green Deal plan with the provider " this can be a combination of Green Deal Finance , other finance as well as- a self-contribution . <p> An installer will complete the work and you as the customer should be benefiting from the energy improvements . <h> More details about the Green Deal Assessment <p> The independent Green Deal assessment is the first part of the Green Deal process and will take at most a couple of hours to complete " from the surveying to the actual write-up and post assessment support . <p> The first part will be a non-intrusive survey by the Assessor ( do n't worry- no floor boards will be lifted up ! ) , and the second half will be an interview with you to learn more about your energy usage habits . <p> The non-intrusive survey is known as the- Energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you have sold , bought or rented a private property since 2007 ) " this is all about the energy performance of your property but it does not take into account how you use energy <p> The occupancy assessment- is the second part of the Green Deal Assessment and this is where the assessor learns more about how the household uses energy . This takes the form of an informal interview , where the- assessor- asks about 15 energy usage questions and also takes a detailed- look at the energy bills for the home . During this- occupancy- assessment your Green Deal Assessor should in addition be able to provide you with some easy tips and tricks to help lower your energy usage . <p> Once both parts of the assessment are completed , a Green Deal report will be completed , which will suggest a series of energy efficiency measures that can be installed in your home . These will obviously vary from house to house , and the amount that you will be able to borrow will depends on the estimated savings calculated . <h> Green Deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of funding available will depend on the following criteria : <p> Age and fabric of the property ; <p> Quality of existing insulation and heating systems ; <p> Size of the property <p> In our experience though , it is very unlikely Green Deal finance will cover the whole cost of the works unless the property is particularly large ; so you need to be prepared to self fund some of the works , or take out the top-up finance. - <h> Green Deal " things to bear in mind <p> There are a few things that we here time and time again when we are doing these Green Deal assessments , so we have included a few of these things below ! <p> The finance you get is on the electricity meter , therefore if you decide to leave the home , the next occupant will take on the finance . This should not influence the next buyers decision to purchase your home , however . Green Deal finance suggests the home will have cheaper energy bills , which should more than offset the Green deal finance . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early if you so choose , although there may be a financial penalty for doing so " your Green Deal provider should be able to advise on this . <p> Just because recommendations are given does n't mean that you are- obliged- to take them . <p> You ca n't influence the recommendations " just because you want a new boiler , if the energy efficiency gains and therefore cost savings are n't there , it is n't going to happen . <p> Double glazing is great , but it does not produce the kind of savings that just about everyone we speak to presumes it does , based on the high initial costs of getting it installed ! <p> The key to increased energy efficiency is- targeting- the envelope , this includes wall insulation , floor insulation , loft insulation and draught proofing " loft insulation is cheap and can make a massive difference . <p> Manage your expectations " choose too many measures and the costs will increase meaning there may not be a big self-funding gap to plug to pay for the measures . <p> Try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aligned to installers which means they are going to be getting- commission- for selling you certain products . Impartial assessors are out there ( and we just happen to be one of them ) . <p> In the following section we look at some other aspects of the Green Deal . <h> How does the Green Deal help improve homes ? <p> By installing insulation throughout your home , the heat produced from the heating system will not escape as quickly as before so less fuel will need to be used up to keep a comfortable temperature . In addition , if a new , energy efficient boiler is installed in the home , more useful heat is produced from every unit of fuel burnt , again helping to lower bills . <p> Types of measures currently covered in the Green Deal scheme : <p> Upgrading the energy efficiency of the envelope of the property , by increasing the amount of insulation in the loft and floor and installing either cavity wall insulation or solid wall insulation . <p> Upgrade old boilers to new , energy efficient condensing boilers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Green Deal help improve energy awareness ? <p> The Green Deal Assessment is a value-added process as it makes the occupier more informed about their everyday energy usage habits . In turn , better energy awareness should drive occupiers to use their energy more wisely , which should drive down the cost people pay . For example : reducing the temperature of the hot water cylinder thermostat , installing central heating thermostats in the correct location , reducing water levels in kettles , washing clothes in eco-mode ' , and turning off unused high energy usage appliances like chest freezers should all help with lower energy bills . <p> We list 100 ways to save energy in the home here " even if you adopt a few , you should see some nice energy savings on your utility bills . <h> Green Deal finance &amp; the ECO grant <p> Green Deal Finance is a loan that customers can apply for , which is determined by the savings estimated on the Green Deal Occupancy Assessment . As mentioned the amount of finance available will vary on the type of home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity bills over a number of years . Green Deal Finance can also be used in conjunction with ECO . <p> There is an additional grant component known as the Energy Companies Obligation ( ECO ) that is available to vulnerable members of society : the elderly and those that are energy poor ( under -15,600 income ) . At present it is not possible to combine the ECO grant and Green Deal Finance <h> 20 comments <p> Who in their right mind would go for a deal like this ? You are saying 10% interest for this Green Deal scheme . I can borrow you money , charge you interest and still make a fair return without having to rip you off . Another Government scheme this Green Deal that has n't  been thought through . I am not a nimbi but we cant install energy efficiency at all costs , especially as we have had this disaster in London . That is my 2 pennys worth for today <p> Hi Ken , Thanks for your comment yes the rate is high , but the scheme does obviously appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the old iteration of the scheme . It is certainly cheaper than get money via the pay day loan schemes . I take your point though , 10% is high but as mentioned I think the reason the Green Deal interest rate is so high is just because of the term of the loan ( 12 years plus ) . <p> How do I find a green deal assessor who is part of the new green deal scheme . I am very conscious our new boiler is on its last legs . I want to get it replaced before winter but would like to take advantage of the green deal to help cover some of the costs . I have read though that not all green deal surveys / reports are accepted , so is there a way to check which companies are genuine or not or do you think it would be better to avoid all together ? <p> I had solar PV panels installed under the green deal finance a couple of years ago . We are just in the process of selling our house but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell the property . Do you know if there are any documents I should read or show the solicitors so that they can understand that this is a legitimate scheme and not that rent a roof scheme which may people signed up on . <p> I am looking for more information on how to access the funding for the Green Deal . I heard the policy came back this year , but am struggling to find out the next steps anywhere on the internet . I am looking to install external wall insulation with the Green Deal and utilise its low interest finance with some CERO ECO funding . Do you know any providers now that are offering this whole package . I have called a few from the Green Deal Orb website , but all I get are , come back to use in a month type responses . <p> Hi Toni , the Green Deal has been relaunched , but the number of companies involved has been reduced dramatically . It is no longer Government backed instead the financing will be offered by a private company . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as and when it becomes available , but I think this initial re-launch is a very softly softly approach to see the software supporting the process works etc . <p> The Green Deal is a load of bs*** if you ask me . So you are paying off a loan on a boiler for 12 years when the useful life of that boiler is only 8 years . How does any of this make any economic sense ? <p> I am after external wall insulation and a new boiler . We tried the green deal in 2013 but none of the providers had any funding and we gave up on it . Can this new green deal finance I heard about fully fund the installation measures I want to install ? Also what is happening with the Green Deal Home Improvement Fund vouchers ? <p> Can someone please call me and offer me some free advice on this green deal . I am 82 years old and retired . My house is freezing and me and my wife would like to install new double glazing , cavity wall insulation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . You have a fantastic resource here for elderly people . If left my ohone number on your email <p> Hi Fred , Thanks for getting in touch in terms of double glazing and cavity wall insulation they should be fine to get under the Green Deal , although you may now be able to get cavity wall insulation fully funded ( i.e. a grant ) under ECO . Solar PV ( the solar panels that make electricity ) are not going to be available under the Green Deal this time unfortunately . We will follow this up on the phone ! <p> Hi , i have been contacted by a compnay saying the Green Deal has been relaunched . I am interested in this energy saving scheme since the last time it came around . Unfortunately I did n't  act quick enough last time ! It closed as I was about to take out the loan to get my new solar panels . I would be very interested in still getting solar panels put on the roof of my property under the green deal scheme . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiler under the scheme . Please can you just confirm whether the scheme is indeed live again as i am pretty keen to move ahead with it if so ! <p> Hi Sean , the Green Deal has indeed been relaunched , however it is a small launch with a limited number of providers . In addition not all the technologies that were included in the first launch of the scheme are included this time around . Included in the technologies that havent made it into this relaunch is solar PV . Boilers are included though so you should be find to get that under the Green Deal . For the solar PV , you will have to wait and see i 'm afraid as to whether it gets relaunched . <p> Hi Remy , Speaking with the Green Deal finance company about a month ago solid wall insulation was one of the technologies they wanted to include in the scheme when it was relaunched so in a word yes , you can get funding for external wall insulation via the Green Deal , but there are only a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth pointing out that the Green Deal is finance , not a Grant ! You may find cheaper finance out there if you look ! <p> Hi there , We have purchased a barn which we intend to renovate and convert into our home for life . We have never had any incentives in the past with our previous homes This being our very first self-build or last should I say . What incentives would be available to us ? We currently reside in the North Pennines on a farm within several acres of our land . We reside at The Barns , Briar Dykes , Baldersdale DL129UU , Barnard Castle , and County Durham . We intend to renovate our barns into a home and would like to install a minimum 8kw solar panels to the roof ( We are South Facing ) , and we are looking at water / ground source heating combined with providing us with our own water supply . We do have free spring water which is shared and owned by a neighbouring farm , but there are some disruptions to the flow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our property has been designed as a Passive-Haus as such we welcome an opportunity to be supported with government funded projects or where we can make a saving . We are confident our barn conversion is subject to VAT saving conditions as set out by the HMRC . Our property is located near to the Hury Reservoir and I can provide you with Architectural plans if required . We intend to submit the work out to tenure dependent upon what cost efficiency savings you can offer as we only have a small sensible budget . If this is you " Then please get in touch on 01833 651859 for consultation . Regards , <p> This new deal has failed . You only need to look at the official " take up " figures that have been published to know that householders do not want to saddle their property with an onward going debt .. I believe also , that it is cheaper to apply for loan from the bank to cover the work than to accept the interest on the loans from Green Deal . I have been pestered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " consultants " . They will charge anything between one &amp; two hundred pounds to listen to come to your house and give their " expert opinion " . Of course their motivation is commission and nothing more . <p> Hi Sue , some fair points . There are companies out there where the motivation is not purely for commission and more about the " bigger picture " , and many readers who we have spoken to who have had an assessment have appreciated that service . I actually think it is the assessment that is real value added part of the whole scheme ( access solid wall insulation grand , for RHI claims , etc ) and everything else a bit up in the air ( depending which angle you are coming from ) . 
@@36749234 @5749234/ <h> How can I keep my home warm this winter ? <h> March 11 , 2015 <p> As the cold weather begins to set in , now is the perfect time to prepare your home ahead of winter to ensure that you can stay nice and toasty inside , even if the temperature outside drops significantly . <p> The key about keeping your home comfortable during the colder months is to slow the rate of heat loss out of the property . There are loads of ways to do this and in this blog we are going to tackle a few of the major improvements you can do to your home to keep it warmer this winter without having to break the bank . <p> The great thing about everything we suggest below is that there is some financial assistance from the Government to help pay for it , be it completely free under the ECO scheme ( for loft and cavity wall insulation ) . Non means tested grants under GDHIF for boilers , solid wall insulation and windows or Green Deal finance , which is available on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schemes are all designed to help make the cost of installing the energy saving measures discussed below more affordable . <p> So let 's begin ! <h> Target the envelope of the home to- keep it warmer ! <p> The key is to target what 's known as the envelope of the house , which includes the floor , the walls ( + windows ) and the roof . <p> If we can slow the movement of heat through these elements then the house will stay much warmer during the winter and the boiler wo n't have to work very hard to keep it at the required temperature . <p> So let 's take a look at each of these elements in turn . <h> Insulating your floors <p> It is estimated about 5-15% of heat loss occurs through the floors " so while certainly not the biggest area of concern , certainly one still worth considering . <p> There are basically two types of floor " suspended ( where floorboards sit on joists ) and solid ( normally made from concrete ) . <p> The suspended floors can be insulated relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first removing floorboards , and then throwing a net over the entire floor . This idea is to let the net sag between the joists and use the net as hammocks in which you can put the wool insulation . <p> By doing this , not only will you stop heat loss , you will also eliminate cold draughts . Obviously there is quite a lot of upheaval to do this since you need to remove floorboards . If you can access the underneath of the floorboards from a basement , then you can do this without having to remove them first and simply stapling the net in place as you go from joist to joist . <p> Insulating a suspended floor is a job we would only really recommend if you were going to be removing the floorboards anyway to be honest , however if the thought of this sounds little daunting you might just want to draught proof them to prevent cold draughts entering the home . <p> This can be done with a product like Draughtex , which is a squidgy rubber sausage that is forced between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is in position it holds perfectly in position , stopping any cold draughts enter the room . <p> Solid floors are insulated by adding non-compressing insulation on top of the floor along with a vapour membrane ( to prevent water entering the home ) , something like Kingspan PIR board or Celotex will do the trick . The problem with solid floor insulation is that it raises the height of the floor " or lowers the ceiling depending on how you look at it ! If you need to retain the height in the room then you will need to dig out the solid floor , which makes the job more complicated and far more expensive . <p> Insulating suspended floors and solid floors can be done under the Green Deal and you can also take advantage of the GDHIF grant . <h> Insulating your walls <p> Similar to floors , here in the UK there are two main types of wall construction " solid walls and cavity walls . <p> Solid walls were pretty much a mainstay of any property built prior to 1935 and they are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to insulate and as such the cost of doing so is rather expensive ( about -100 per m2 as a guide price ) . Solid walls can be insulated internally or externally , but the idea is the same , to add an insulating layer to the wall to slow the movement of heat across it . <p> Commonly 100mm of insulation is added to the walls , so if this is done internally it can take up a lot of space . If done externally you lose the feel of the brick , since the insulation sits in top of it and then gets rendered . The advantage of doing it externally is that it prevents penetrating damp ; the walls act as a heat store when the heating turns off and you retain the full size of your home . <p> If your home was built after 1935 , the chances are it has cavity walls " this cavity wall has historically been designed to stop water entering the home . The water can penetrate the first layer of brick , but when it hits the cavity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second skin of brick . <p> Nowadays these cavities are filled during the construction process either with wool or solid insulation board ( + a vapour membrane ) . There is a way to retrospectively fill cavity walls though and since the industry is now relatively well established ( about 6m homes have retrospectively been insulated with cavity wall insulation ) the price of doing these works is quite cheap ( about -10 / m2 ) . <p> The Government consider this along with loft insulation as the most cost effective ways to insulate properties , so much so they now offer cavity wall insulation for free for homes in the UK , but make sure any works done are carried out by a CIGA approved cavity wall installer " they provide you with a 25 year old warranty . It is worth mentioning that cavity wall insulation is not suitable for every property . If for example your property gets hit by consistent driving rain then insulating the cavities could lead to damp . <p> Whatever type of wall you have in your home , insulating it in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is estimated about 35% of the heat in your home escapes through the walls if they are uninsulated . Obviously cavity wall is can be free in many cases , but the Government are trying to redress the balance and are offering generous grants to help homes cover some of the install costs for those that are forced to go the solid wall insulation route like the GDHIF scheme . <p> In our opinion insulating the walls of your home is just about the best thing you can do to help keep your home warm this winter . Even when the colder weather does hit , your home will stay nice and cosey ! <h> Insulating Windows <p> Worth touching upon here is windows since they are normally found within the walls . Many people assume that windows are going to be the best investment in terms of improving the energy efficiency of your home " probably because they too have witnessed those terrible window adverts on TV ( and yes we are talking about you Safestyle ! ) <p> Well the truth is the windows are the real weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window is still comparatively rubbish compared to a properly insulated wall in terms of the speed at which heat escapes across it . <p> So yes , while a single glazed window might let in a huge amount of cold air ( and let warm air escape ) , spending -500 to replace it should n't really be a priority because there are things that you can do to your home to make a much more substantial difference . Do n't misunderstand this though " we are not saying double glazing is bad " undoubtedly it will improve the comfort of any room with it installed " but it just is n't as good as the adverts make out " so we would definitely not make it your no.1 priority to help keep your home warm this winter ! <h> Insulating the roof space <p> This is the number 1 best way to keep your home warm this Winter " put lots and lots on insulation up in the loft ! <p> The reason is that it is seriously cheap to do either via ECO " where it tends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll costs about -15 from B&amp;Q ) . Loft insulation will help save you heaps of money since about 30% of the heat in the home escapes through and uninsulated loft space . <p> Despite the fact you can get it done for free by the energy companies under the ECO scheme , if you want to store bits and pieces up in the loft you are going to need to do this as a DIY job . <p> We have written detailed instructions on how you can do this HERE , and honestly it is really easy so well worth doing ! <p> We recommend installing the loft insulation to a depth of about 250-300mm . This will take the u-value of the roof space down to about 0.16 " which is in line with building regulations ( i.e. what a new house today needs to be insulated to ) . <p> Even though loft insulation is so easy to do , it is estimated only about 70% of homes with a loft here in the UK have had it insulated " we really do recommend it as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Insulating Chimneys <p> One area that people seldom insulate ( or at least draught proof ) is the chimney . Even though it only gets used twice a year , they feel the need to keep the chimney open all year just in case ! It is really worth blocking it with a chimney balloon or chimney sheep if it is not in use since cold air rushes down chimneys if they are not lit and likewise the hot expensive air produced by your heating system escapes just as readily . <h> FROM -14.49 <p> These sheep / balloons cost about -25 each , so definitely a worthwhile investment ! <h> Draught proofing around doors and windows <p> Although the gaps around doors and windows are much smaller than a chimney , they still let in really cold air that can rapidly cool down your home .

If it is a small 1 bed flat , then the energy savings from replacing that boiler would be far smaller than a detached 5 bed property and therefore the amount of finance made available will be far lower . <p> In terms of costs , the cost of replacing a boiler starts at about -1750 , but costs can spiral depending on what else needs to be done ( i.e. if the boiler needs to be moved , if you are replacing a heat only boiler with a combi ) " it can however really be worth doing if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have it " lots of ways to keep your home warmer this winter ! <p> So there you have it " a quick summary of what you can do in your home to keep it warmer this winter .

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is warm where I live and the thick stone walls keep the house cool . <p> My question needs to have a scientific answer . My question iswhy , when my house is always at 20-C , do I have to put on warm winter clothes in winterindoorsbut only need t-shirt , shorts and sandals in summer ? The indoor temperature is always 20-C , so why do I feel cold in winter ? <p> I 'm sure the answer has something to do with reflection of heat or reflection of cold . Is the warmth of my body reflected away from me towards the cold air outside , or is the cold air outside reflected towards my warm body ? <p> I reiterate that despite the temperature always being at 20-C I need warm clothing in winter and only need t-shirt , shorts and sandals in summer . . <p> Hi Bruce , thanks for posting . We have been in touch with colleagues at UCLand we received this kind response from Maria Papantoni . <p> " Human thermal comfort can be affected by several parameters . Thermal comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thermal environment and is closely connected with the clothing insulation and the metabolic rate of people . <p> Of course , environmental parameters , such as the indoor dry bulb and mean radiant temperature , play the most important role to this phenomenon . The air temperature of a space can also be influenced by the ventilation heat loss coefficient which is the heat carried out of the building by the movement of air . The heat produced by the human metabolism should be equal to the heat lost by the body . During the heating season the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor temperature is higher so the air movement is also higher that makes the spaces losing heat more quickly . This causes the cold feeling within occupants , despite the fact that the temperature is constant . <p> Thermal comfort can also be influenced by internal relative humidity and air velocity . In winter , it is a very common phenomenon to have cold drafts or thermal bridges that reduces the thermal comfort of the occupants . The opposite happens during summer when hot air is absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . <p> However , physiological parameters such as the human metabolic rate are also important and can not be omitted . For example , different human activities have different metabolic rates such as when somebody is seated/ relaxed the metabolic rate is 1.0 met while when the same person is doing house cleaning is between 2.0-3.5 met . The metabolic rate expresses the amount of energy expended in a given period by the human body . " <p> No problem Anitta , hopefully enough to get you started ! Our tip is to get these things sorted well in advance of the winter months because installers charge a premium in the Autumn months ! Some of the energy saving measures also take quite a long time to get installed !

There are no batteries , no- electrical- charging required and instant light on winding . There are 3 brightness levels to choose from , so winding the handle for 3 minutes will provide 20 minutes of light with all 12 LED bulbs on , 30 minutes when 8 of the LED bulbs are lit and 40 minutes if only 4 of the LEDs are on . <h> How does it work ? <p> The lantern has 12 LED bulbs , with settings to use all 12 , 8 or 4 for varying levels of light . It is charged by winding a handle , which drives a dynamo . There are therefore no batteries required , and no carbon emissions , other than the emissions in creating it . <h> How did it work for me ? <p> Well it is camping season , the festivals are well underway , and that generally means stacks of batteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lantern . After hearing about these LED wind-ups I really wanted to give them a try , so I packed my bags for Glastonbury and put in a couple of these lanterns for the tent . <p> After taking it out of the box , I wound the handle and got an instant white light . The settings do seem to make a difference , but even on the highest setting , it was n't overly bright . But with two of them I had ample light to see what I was doing in the tent and made it possible to get changed without falling over things , and under different circumstance ( if I was on a camping trip for example ) I am pretty sure I could have read a book , although the light is a little white for me I miss the warm light that I get with my LEDs at home , but I appreciate this is a personal choice ! <p> I also found there was an initial brightness that tends to wear off after a few minutes . So , despite lasting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 bulbs illuminated , it was certainly brighter in the first 2-3 minutes , but if you were looking to read or something it would require you to wind repeatedly . The lantern would however be really useful in a power cut or when you need to get out of your tent to go to the toilet during the night though . <p> So the lantern is are a great little product if you need to do pretty simple tasks in the dark , like getting changed , or find the toilet , however for doing things like reading a book it works less well due to the continual winding to keep the optimum brightness . Perhaps one of the more expensive models has a better light and lasts longer , but that will need another review

And when you compare them to other energy efficiency improvements " which are better in terms of payback time on the initial investment ? <p> Let 's start by looking at some of the more common energy efficiency upgrades for the home and their relative cost . Putting modern energy efficient double glazing in a home with single glazing will save you around -100 a year on a semi detached property ( around -50 for a flat and -150 or more for a detached house ) . In comparison , cavity wall insulation and loft insulation could save you upwards of -150 , and at a much lower cost . <p> Let 's have a look at the payback time : <p> Measure <p> Typical Cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time <p> Double Glazing <p> -10,000 <p> -100 <p> 100 years <p> Cavity Wall Insulation <p> -1,000 <p> -150 <p> 7 years <p> Loft Insulation <p> -300 <p> -150 <p> 2 years <p> As we can see , the payback on glazing compared to other measures is very poor . <h> Why is glazing so poor at paying back ? <p> There are two main reasons why the payback for glazing is so bad " the first is the cost of a window ( glass + frame materials ) compared to something like fibreglass insulation . When you consider the windows need to be made to measure , as well as the fact they have mechanical parts ( sash windows or hinges ) and some include vacuums between the glass it is obvious that the cost is far more expensive than a roll of fibreglass for your loft . <p> The other reason glazing does n't pay back well is that the area of window compared to the area of exposed wall is so little . A typical house may only have 10-15% of its surface area as window " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving the insulating properties of that wall is a far better investment than installing brand new windows . <p> It is also important to note that you can make big gains on the efficiency of your windows by simply adding some good draught proofing or inexpensive magnetic secondary glazing . New windows are nice to have , but there other energy efficiency measures that we would get installed first based on the payback . Having said that , windows do definitely improve the comfort of the property , and if the seal has gone in your old double-glazing and they have fogged up " replacing them might be the only option . <h> Funding for windows <p> The other thing that makes windows less attractive as a measure is that the funding available is not particularly great . You can get up to -650 cashback on the Green Deal , and perhaps get 10-20% financed ( paid back on your electricity bills via the Green Deal ) .

In some cases you are looking at just a few pounds a year ! <p> Old windows with rotting frames may need to be replaced anyway . <p> That means it is never usually worthwhile getting new windows on energy efficiency grounds alone . If you have other reasons for getting new windows " like reducing noise , rotting frames or aesthetic reasons , then of course it may make sense for you .

Remember that approximately 4 million homes in the UK are n't connected to the grid ( out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many , oil boilers really are their only option ! <h> Is heating oil expensive ? <p> As of July 2016 , the cost of 1 litre of was 33.78 pence based on a 1000 litre delivery . Obviously a bigger order may mean the cost comes down a little per litre and a smaller order may mean you might pay a little more . <p> In 1 litre of Kerosene , there are 10.35kWh of heat " so each kWh of oil works out at 3.2 pence per kWh . This is marginally cheaper than buying a unit of gas from the mains grid which works out at about 3.8p / kWh . <h> The 2 downsides of heating oil <p> There are a couple of major downsides when you heat your home with heating oil <p> The first one is that you can run out ! <p> When was young , we had a oil boiler at home which we used for our heating , hot water and cooking . I remember it was around Christmas and we ran out of oil , obviously this is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had very friendly neighbours who made sure we did n't starve ! <p> This is one of the major issues with oil though and is the reason that even though the price of heating oil is a bit cheaper , many people with access to mains gas will always stick with that ! <h> The fluctuating price of oil <p> Secondly , the price of oil fluctuates based on world events , and therefore the price you pay for a full tank can be very different each time you fill up the tank . While it is currently comparatively cheap to buy heating oil ( 3.2p / kWh ) , only 18 months ago it was 4.5p / kWh . We would always recommend buying heating oil plenty ahead of time ideally at the beginning of the summer when demand is generally low and therefore prices are also lower . <h> Where can I buy heating oil ? <p> You can use the Federation of Petroleum Suppliers ( FPS ) directory to find suppliers in your area . <h> 3 comments <p> Thanks for the advice on heating oils and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that heating oils were used on the range ; however , now I know that you can use them to heat up the home as well . My wife and I are actually looking for more cost efficient ways to heat our home and so we might try this out ! Thanks again ! <p> I use oil , I changed from gas 20 odd years back , because gas was so expensive ; , second winetr quarter bill was -440. my property is an 80 year old bungalow , fairly well insulated and all glass is sudg , there is some underfloor insulation , but its not complete and I have exposed floors ( no carpets ) , there is a small log stove in lounge/diner , mostly for looks , but mainly I have rads , some I have updated to the low capacity convection type and will also do same to beds , in due course and when can get comparable size , of rad not involving too much pipe work . The boiler is regularly serviced and the plumber also does a few other jobs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank be careful here if you have pressurised , this often gets missed and any overflows can work out costly , fortunately thames water were accomodating on my waste when this happened in 2015 , so pressurised not quite so brilliant as first sold to me , and you lose an airing cupboard as hot tank not needed as such . Oil is fine , but the winter 7/.8 months in uk uses most fuel , I do n't  know comaprsions with gas , but for that period I 'd suggest oil is little better , however the rest of time of year , you can have tons of hot water and negligible bills , IMO , regarding oil fillups , you really need a bigger tank than a lot of these modern plastic things , else you will be calling tanker round more than necessary , I use about 2500 litres annually , so get 2 calls a year , I never run tank dry , so in summer when oil is cheap buy some , the tank has a visual gauge or you can dip same or get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see what you 're using and what its costing you .

@@36749243 @5749243/ <h> The proposed reduction to the solar PV feed-in tariff in Jan 2016 <h> September 1 , 2015 <p> The Feed-in tariffs scheme ( FITs ) was introduced in April 2010 by the UK government to promote the deployment of small-scale renewable and low carbon electricity generation technologies as part of their obligation to meet the Renewable Energy Directive . The scheme is applicable to a number of technologies including PV , Wind , Hydroelectric and Anaerobic Digestion ( AD ) up to a maximum total installed capacity ( TIC ) of 5MW . The main aim of the feed-in tariff is to drive down the cost of those technologies by providing potential investors with the security to make long-term investments . <h> Previous Legislation in the UK <p> The 2009 Renewable Energy Directive had set a target for the UK to achieve 15% of its energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020 . However , in 2010 the UK produced 6.5% of electricity from renewable sources , falling short of its 10% target and in 2011 it only reached 9.6% . Failure to meet the 2010 target raises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binding EU target set for 2020 , however the FIT was introduced to encourage uptake of these renewable sources . <p> The FIT scheme provides three financial Incentives : <h> Generation tariff <p> The energy supplier will pay a set rate for each unit ( kWh ) of electricity generated . The level of tariff is dependent on the technology and size of installation . Once registered , tariff levels are guaranteed and index- linked . This will be covered later in this section . <h> Export tariff <p> All technologies receive a further fixed rate for each unit of electricity supplied to the grid . Currently , it is estimated as 50% of the electricity generated. - <h> Electricity bill savings <p> Electricity generated on-site will reduce the amount of electricity required from the grid resulting in reduced energy bills . <p> The scheme has been hugely successful in increasing the installed capacity generated from PV . In total over 500,000 properties have had solar PV installed since the launch of the FIT scheme . <h> The current FIT figures <p> The table below summarises the latest PV tariffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of December 2015 . <p> Solar PV- System size <p> Generation tariff <p> Export tariff <p> Eligibility date- 1 Jul 2015 to 30 Sep 2015 <p> Eligibility date- 1 Oct 2015 to 31 Dec 2015 <p> Eligibility date 1- Jul 2015 to 30 Dec 2015 <p> Higher rate ( EPC band D or above ) <p> Lower rate ( EPC not band D or above ) <p> Higher rate ( EPC band D or above ) <p> Lower rate ( EPC not band D or above ) <p> 4kW or under <p> 12.92 p/kWh <p> 5.94 p/kWh <p> 12.47 p/kWh <p> 5.94 p/kWh <p> 4.85 p/kWh <p> &gt; 4kW " 10kW <p> 11.71 p/kWh <p> 5.94 p/kWh <p> 11.30 p/kWh <p> 5.94 p/kWh <p> 4.85 p/kWh <p> &gt; 10kW " 50kW <p> 11.71 p/kWh <p> 5.94 p/kWh <p> 11.30 p/kWh <p> 5.94 p/kWh <p> 4.85 p/kWh <p> Stand-alone <p> 4.44 p/kWh <p> 4.28 p/kWh <p> 4.85 p/kWh <p> If you imagine a 4kW system installed on a south facing roof ( comprised of 16 x 250w solar panels ) , you could expect that to make approximately 3,800kWh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only can you use- the electricity you produce in the home ( meaning you do n't  need to buy it from the grid ) , you will also be paid for every unit you generate . <p> That means you will be paid 3800kWh x 12.92p / kWh = -490.96 per year guaranteed for 20 years . <p> The big issue however is the Government is proposing to slash the generation tariff ( part of the feed-in tariff ) by 87% down to just 1.63p/kWh . <h> The- end of the solar Feed-in Tariff is nigh ? <p> The Government is proposing to reduce the FIT by as much as 87% come January 1st 2016 " so for a household ' sized system the payment would reduce from 12.92 p/kWh down to just 1.63 p/kWh . <p> So while under the current feed-in tariff , the annual payment of the 4kW system described above would be just shy of -500 , under the proposed feed-in tariff from- Jan 2016 , this payment would be just -60 per year " taking the total return to just -1,200 . <p> Obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff ( where you are paid for exporting electricity back to the grid ) and also the energy savings one could expect because of the ability to use the electricity produced in the home rather than buying it from the grid " however the proposed reductions will have a huge negative impact on the amount of solar that gets installed . In fact DECC have admitted that the proposed changes to the feed-in tariff rates could wipe 6GW off UK renewable generation capacity by 2020/21 . <p> With nuclear power plants and coal power plants closing at a rate of knots , it is going to be interesting to see what the Governments next move is to try and maintain the headroom between the UK 's energy supply and demand .

There are also several new features in new models ( by companies such as Dimplex ) that make them a more attractive option than they were . <p> The controls are better , meaning you can normally set heating schedules for greater efficiency and thermal comfort . This means you do n't  have to waste heat chucking it out when you 're not even in the house . <p> Some models have a Boost function , meaning you can still heat your home when there is more demand than usual .

While the Economy 7 tariff is still around , you can charge your storage heaters at night , while electricity is at its cheapest .

We have demand of 47GW , of which 18% is coming from nuclear , 20% is coming from coal , 54% is coming from gas and just 8% is coming from renewables ( wind / hydro / biomass and solar ) . <p> The bad news is that nuclear , gas and coal are all running pretty much full tilt at the minute . <p> Why oh why have the Government not bothered planning for this ? ! We have just been given the green light on a new nuclear power plant which will certainly help , but the chance of this being constructed and connected to the gird before the other nuclear plants begin to go offline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be added to the grid and this is something we are huge advocates of , however the fact that most renewables are intermittent and a lack of energy storage at the moment ( batteries in the most part ) , means there is always going to be a need for base load power in the grid . <p> It is exceptionally easy to blame the push towards renewables as the main problem , but why is Government so short sighted ? We have had 50 years to create a succession plan for nuclear plants but it has just been left to the next Government . The bottom line is that it is n't currently competitive for the UK to pull coal out of the ground or drill for oil from the North Sea , therefore we are always going to be reliant on other countries for our fuel sources , but whatever way we go we need to be building power plants . Obviously - we would prefer a- push towards gas rather than coal , but nuclear certainly does have a part to play . All the while we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliance on other countries to provide our fuel . <p> We have discussed this before but the real turning point will be when we have the first blackout . It will suddenly bring the issue to the forefront of the average Joe rather than those that take an interest in energy policy . Tell someone they ca n't turn their heating on , or that they ca n't boil a kettle , and people have reason to be upset . <h> What 's next for UK energy policy ? <p> Energy efficiency will of course have a huge part to play , since this should reduce energy demand , meaning less capacity is required . Likewise , demand side management is going to have a part to play , but even this is going to cost the tax payer money since we will need to foot the bill to encourage big energy users to use less energy at peak times . <p> As the BIG report alludes to , the cost of emergency power is very expensive and this is costing the tax payer . Well , surely it is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine energy policy where we begin to build up baseload capacity . <p> My closing thoughts are this " yes , it is easy to drive past a wind turbine and get angry that it is n't spinning , but look at the bigger picture , the Government has dropped the ball in such a huge way over the last 20 years . They talk and talk but never actually do anything " surely new base power is marginally more important than investing in HS2 . The Government needs to act , and it needs to act now ! <p> I am suprised you are not highlighting the benefits of renewables more . Offshore wind ( which the UK is a leader in ) is becoming more and more affordable as the size of the wind turbines increases . Dong and some of the other offshore turbine companies are vowing to cut costs to -70 per MWh by 2025 . If so , the strike prices may start to match the wholesale price of electricity in the UK market . This would mean that the these companies would start paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The industrys research arm Inwind is already drawing up plans for the next generation of 10-20 MW turbines . The Sandia National Laboratories in the US are exploring 50 MW monsters with segmented ultralight morphing rotors . <p> So maybe the costs are going to fall even further . While I agree the Government seem completely inept with regards to energy policy , we certainly should n't stop supporting renewables just when we are on the cusp of producing something pretty special . I also think the great benefit of the off-shore turbines is that far few people complain about them because they are n't  in their backyard . <p> I for one think we should have a mix of offshore wind ( admittedly unpredictable ) , gas plants for baseload because they are so reactive and tidal because that is perhaps the most predictable type of renewable . If we were to get to that place then we are stop this stupidly expensive Hinkley C experiment and focus on the technologies that we can then export around the world .

But more than that you may be prevented from renting out the property at all , until improvements are made . <h> EPCs and the law <p> It is a legal requirement for all rented homes in the UK to have a valid EPC certificate . These must be renewed every 10 years . An EPC survey measures the energy efficiency and typical energy use of your property , giving it a rating from A ( most efficient ) to G ( least efficient ) . It then gives suggestions of how to improve your rating , such as installing measures like loft insulation . <p> From 1st April 2018 , a change of legislation means that any properties rented out in the private sector must have a minimum energy rating of E on their Energy Performance Certificate . The regulations will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with effect from 1st April 2018 and for all existing tenancies on 1st April 2020 . It will be illegal- to rent a property which breaches the requirement for a minimum E rating , unless there is an applicable exemption . If there is a breach in this legislation and the property- has- a low EPC rating then the landlord could have to pay a -4000 fine . <p> The reason for these rules is that an energy inefficient property is considered substandard accommodation , as it places higher heating costs on the tenant . It is the landlords responsibility to ensure their tenants are comfortable and are not paying over the odds on their energy bills . The stepped nature of these changes means that if you are a standing tenant or do n't  require a renewal of the contract then there will be no obligation to improve the energy efficiency before 2020 . Existing tenancies will be part of the legislation from April 2020 , so at this point every rented property in the UK will need to be brought up to an E rating or higher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being implemented , there is no harm in getting ahead why not book your property in for an EPC now ? - It is well worth spending the minimal amount- an EPC costs and avoiding a potentially hefty fine further down the line . Prices start at around -35 , although it varies greatly- depending on where you are , as well as the size and complexity of the building . <p> Plus , if you find that your property is not up to standard , then it gives you enough time to take remedial action . If you leave it until the last minute , then it could be a mad rush to get the property up to scratch , or risk losing out on valuable rental income whilst works are carried out . <h> How do you get your low EPC rating up to an E ? <p> Most properties in the UK are at least an E rating .

@@36749251 @5749251/ <h> 5 reasons to get solar panels <h> May 25 , 2017 <p> Solar panels ( also known as solar PV ) are a great way to generate electricity at home . Although they are not a cheap investment , they are the most common type of home renewable in the UK . Weve put together our top 5 reasons to get solar panels . <h> Free electricity <p> Yes , you 'll have to pay the upfront cost of the system , but after that you will benefit from free electricity . The payback time will vary depending on the price and size of the system installed , whether or not it incorporates battery storage , and the financial incentives available at the time . They could pay for themselves ( in savings on your bills and Feed-in Tariff payments ) within 10 years , or it could take longer . But if you 're going to be staying in your home for decades to come , the system will almost always pay for itself over that time period . Maintenance costs are low , as the only routine attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Cut your carbon footprint <p> Generating your own renewable electricity is a great way to reduce your impact on the environment . When you import your energy from the National Grid , you cant know exactly where your energy comes from . In the UK , a lot of it is generated using fossil fuels , which has detrimental effects on the environment . If you make your own energy , you know exactly where it comes from the sun ! Solar energy does n't  produce any emissions or harm the planet , so it is an obvious choice for the environmentally conscious . <p> The more people that supply their own green electricity even if it makes up only some of what they consume the less pressure on the UK to generate enough energy at all costs . Unfortunately , the current governments plans for keeping the lights on revolve mainly around fossil fuels . <h> Get paid for what you generate <p> The government Feed-in Tariff pays you for every unit of renewable electricity you generate . Although rates have dropped , free money is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months and years , and its a welcome benefit if you would like to install the technology for other reasons . Payment rates change regularly , but ( depending on the size of the system ) , some are- currently as much as 4.5p per unit . See current rates here . <h> Get paid for what you export <p> The Feed-in Tariff also pays you ( per kWh ) for the leftover energy you export back to the grid . All solar PV systems have a generation meter , but most do n't  have an export meter . This means that the government has to estimate the amount of electricity you generate . This is called deeming , and at the moment the estimated export amount is set at 50% of a systems generation reading . Youll be paid this even if you use all the electricity you generate yourself , and do n't  in fact send half of it to the National Grid , like they estimate . <p> Battery storage can take this one step further . Until recently , there was no way to store electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the point of generation , or redistributed to be used somewhere else . Batteries transform electrical energy into chemical energy for storage , which can then be used later on . Recent advancements mean battery storage systems are now available on a domestic scale . This means you could potentially keep all your own electricity and maximise savings , because you wont need to pay to import as much , and youll still be paid for what you generate . However you 'll need to bear in mind that although these systems are dropping in price , they are still expensive . <h> Independence from the grid means more stability <p> If you are in a position to create your own electricity at home , you will be less vulnerable to energy price hikes , like the ones we have seen in recent months ! The less energy you need to import into your home , the less reliant you are on energy companies ( the vast majority of which are out to make huge profits ) . <p> An increase in people generating some of their own electricity could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the UK energy distribution is currently unclear , due to increasing pressure on the National Grid from reduced generation levels . Experts are warning that we may soon face blackouts. - Every unit of energy produced by domestic systems is a unit that does n't  have to be delivered by the UKs straining grid . An extra benefit is that if you have the right kind of battery storage system , you may have backup power in the event of a power cut ! <h> Installing solar PV <p> Are you thinking about installing shortly ! <p> Interested in getting a solar PV system installed ? 184572 @qwx384572 
@@36749252 @5749252/ <h> First time of use tariff introduced <h> January 4 , 2017 <p> We 've been wondering for some time now if energy companies would start offering time of use tariffs in a bid to soften the predicted energy shortage in the UK . In fact , we first wrote about the idea back in 2012 . <p> A new tariff offers discounted off-peak electricity , aiming to encourage people to run their most power-hungry appliances at night , when demand is at its lowest ; thus putting less strain on the National Grid . This could hopefully save us having to import even more gas from Norway , after decommissioning coal power plants has left the UK with a dip in electricity production. - Although reducing air pollution by shutting these plants is good news for the planet , there has been nothing built to replace them with , as the Government continue to ignore renewables <p> The answer could be on its way , thanks to- supplier- Green Energy UK ( which notably gets all its energy from renewable sources in the UK ) introducing the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariffs <p> The new tariff means- lower bills for customers and less pressure for UK infrastructure . By running appliances such as dishwashers and washing machines at night , power surges can be avoided , hopefully ensuring a constant supply of energy . The tariff requires a smart meter , which are currently being installed free of charge by energy providers all over the country . These give you real-time information on much energy you are using and allow you to track costs . The national roll out- of smart meters is already underway and the government aims to install- 53million by 2020 . Hopefully , the more people who have them installed , the more energy providers will realise demand is there and introduce their own time of use tariffs . <h> How are Time of Use- tariffs different from Economy 7 ? <p> Existing Economy 10 and Economy 7 tariffs are both time-based electricity tariffs , but these need special meters and are only good value with storage heaters ( which are often inefficient and problematic , especially as some do n't know how to use them so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway ) . Besides , Economy 7 probably wo n't be around for much longer . Coal and nuclear power plants ( which ca n't switch off at night , hence the introduction of- cheap night rates ) are- being decommissioned. - This means there will soon be no reason to continue offering the tariff . <h> What savings can people expect to make ? <p> Pretty big ones ! Green Energy UKs plan offers electricity at 20p cheaper per unit overnight , so if you 're smart about when you run your appliances , you could see a big reduction in your bills . - <p> The prices of their Tide ' tariff are as follows : <p> WEEKDAY <p> 23:00 " 06:00 <p> 4.99p/kWh <p> 06:00 " 16:00 <p> 11.99p/kWh <p> 16:00 " 19:00 <p> 24.99p/kWh <p> 19:00 " 23:00 <p> 11.99p/kWh <p> WEEKEND <p> 23:00 " 06:00 <p> 4.99p/kWh <p> 06:00 " 23:00 <p> 11.99p/kWh <p> The cheapest rate is 11pm-6pm- every night , when electricity is just 4.99p per unit . <h> A word on battery storage <p> These tariffs could lead to a bigger take-up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximise savings from time of use tariffs . With a battery storage system ( which there are quite a few of on the market these days ) , people can charge batteries during the hours of cheaper electricity and then use this electricity whenever they need it. - The current average price for energy- is around 12.5p per unit , so buying most of a households electricity at the price- of- 4.99p instead could save people- hundreds of pounds over the course of a year . <p> So , this is pretty big news and we think good news too ! It only requires easy behavioural changes for consumers and could make a big difference in terms of energy demand . <p> Are you moving to a time of use tariff ? Let us know how you get on in the comments below ! <h> 4 comments <p> As far as I can see , Green energy are only offering this tarif if you have both gas and electricity from them . For those of us who do not have a gas supply , we are unable to take advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting point here . I expect batteries to really find their place during 2017 . I think they will become more and more mainstream because they will become more affordable but also I think people are recognising the plight that the UK is in with regards to black outs that could well become a reality in the coming days / months / years . <p> Hi KevinP , thanks for your comment . I guess the hope is that the industry settles on a particular technology . Many of the battery energy storage companies are looking at relatively low capacity batteries ( Lithium ) which are designed to help reduce the need to pull electricity from the grid , but also help manage the export of electricity produced from solar panels ( i.e. do n't  export it back to the grid , instead use it in the house ) , but time of use tariffs do open up the possibility of getting much larger home battery systems installed to take advantage of drawing electricity when it is cheap .

For once , we thought it would be worth looking around the globe at other countries and if we could learn anything about insulation that could apply to UK homes . <p> The UK in fact has some of the lowest gas prices in Europe , so why does it cause so many more problems than other countries ? The key lies in insulation " and the UK has some of the worst insulated homes in Europe . In Scandinavia , where insulation is absolutely vital , deaths from the cold are much lower than in Britain . That just should not be the case , when insulation is such an easy way to reduce your bills . There are some grants available now that can help pay for the cost of the installation however , so make sure you check out our insulation page if you need insulation yourself . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken the lead in many areas of the energy industry , from producing clean energy , to top insulation standards , to green roof technology . It also invented the Passivhaus Standard . This is a building standard designed to make homes super efficient " making them ultra insulated and airtight , with excellent ventilation and heat recovery systems . It means that heating is almost unnecessary " and indeed , many do not come with any conventional heating at all . The UK is heading towards this philosophy in its code for sustainable homes , but it has n't quite taken the idea to heart like Germany has . <p> Like Germany , Norway takes insulation really seriously . In a country where temperatures drop down to -20 , home insulation standards have been in place since the Second World War and homes are generally very well insulated compared to the UK . Deaths because of the cold are also much lower in Norway " largely because of these top standards . <h> Insulation in Australia ? <p> It might sound odd , but insulation is taken very seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australian deserts often have a huge range of temperatures over the course of a year . This difference , often from 45 to 0 , creates extremely difficult and uncomfortable living conditions . However , just insulating the roofs and the walls of properties allow for cool air to be trapped in the house during summer , and the building to maintain its heat throughout winter . Insulating and making a property airtight " without draughts prevents the warm outside air from getting into the house , and helps improve the efficiency of the air conditioning . This leads to savings on the energy bills as well as a more comfortable living environment . This is a lesson for those of us in the UK who say our home is warm enough and does n't need insulation " you could n't be more wrong " the more insulation , the cooler your house will be in the summer months . <h> Extremely cold climates <p> The UK , whilst getting below freezing at times , rarely experiences extreme temperatures . Where it gets down to -20 degrees or more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important . There is some research to suggest that at very low temperatures , blown , loose insulation and wool/fibre insulation is less effective . As a result , airtight foam or rigid insulation is preferable in order to ensure effective insulation at these temperatures . <h> Economic trouble in Greece <p> Greece has , in recent years , faced some turbulent times . Job cuts , high taxation and tough economic measures have created a dangerous scenario for the domestic homeowner . In fact , it was so tough that domestic fuel use dropped by around 2/3rds simply because of the number of people who could not afford to have their heating on during the winter . A few easy steps per household , taken out prior to the county 's problems , would have provided the ideal solution and protected them from the cold . As it is , thousands are freezing with only short-term fuel subsidies to give them temporary relief . A more long-term solution would be to provide the public with stability , in the form of insulation . <p> Insulation is important around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We hope that the UK can improve on the currently insulation levels , and homeowners can start to protect themselves from cold weather and volatile energy prices . <p> It seems crazy to me that the UK government pay out a yearly winter fuel allowance to those in need ; which does n't  come close to covering the cost of the fuel they need to heat their poorly insulated homes . Surely it would be much more efficient to spend this money on improving the insulation in these homes . I have done many visits to the elderly during the winter months and on one occasions found a lady with her oven turned on with the oven door open to keep her house warm enough ! !

There are huge implications for them too " they will be able to bill people accurately , no more disputes ( or at least only a few compared to now ! ) and these things should improve their profitability . <p> Aside from the cash implications for the energy company , the information provided from the smart meters should help the- companies better manage supply and demand .

If third parties can get hold of the usage data " e.g. a marketing agency " they might be able to learn consumer 's behaviour , sleeping patterns etc and target them accordingly . <p> Likewise if a criminal were to get hold of the data they could see when energy usage is next to zero and make the assumption that the house is empty making it ripe for burglary ( although we are perhaps scaremongering now ) . <p> The key though is that households can opt out of sharing the data , but whether or not consumers will be aware of this is obviously unknown at the moment ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the smart meter roll out , the plan is for every home to have a smart meter installed by 2020 .

Double glazing seems to be a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loft or rafters under the roof will make a bigger difference ( and cost significantly less ) , than getting expensive double glazing " although there are of course other reasons for getting double glazing installed , such as its acoustic insulating ability . <p> Walls are another area of the home that people are often ignorant about . Some people may suggest that a thick wall means better efficiency , however that is not necessarily the case . Brick is a poor insulator and therefore thickness is not particularly important . The construction of the walls however is very important , and older solid wall properties will lose much more heat through the wall than a more modern cavity wall . Often people are confused over cavity walls and insulation " cavity walls are only insulated once they have been filled , even though an uninstalled , unfilled cavity is more energy efficient than a solid wall . <p> Draughts really do make a big impact on the efficiency of a home . Most heating in homes is in the form of convection space heating , so the radiator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem is air has a very low thermal capacity , so a cool draught will very quickly remove the heat from the air . Getting draught proofing for doors and windows and ensuring fireplaces are properly draught-proofed is essential , and costs very little in comparison to savings made , potentially paying back in a couple of years or less . <p> Thickness of loft insulation is also important , and the building regulations for the recommended thickness seem to be continually changing. - Even if your loft was insulated 5 years ago , it is very likely that more insulation will be required , as it is now recommended to install loft insulation to a thickness of 270mm or more . <h> - Boilers and Hot Water Tanks- Energy Misconceptions <p> The hot water tank jacket is an often overlooked piece of insulation , yet can repay itself in a year in some instances . Confusion can arise over the spray foam often factory applied to the tank . In many cases this is not very thick , and a simple wrap-around jacket can save money . <p> Water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower timers and tap aerators all help reduce water and heating bills . For those on water metres there is a double saving to be made , as these measures help reduce the hot water used ( and thus heating bills ) and the will also reduce the volume of water used . <p> A new boiler can be very expensive and in some cases not necessary . Getting a highly efficient boiler when the house is poorly insulated will often make less of a difference than getting walls and roof spaces properly insulated . <p> Further , heating controls are also very important . Without being able to control room temperatures and set timers , much energy is needlessly wasted . Those without sufficient controls often leave the heating on too long , and end up needing to open a window to let the heat out , or forget to turn the hot water off . Without individual room controls , rooms not in use or not in need of heating get unnecessarily overheated , and waste valuable energy . <h> Habits and Lifestyles <p> People today are often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many of which require little or no cost , but they are often not aware that these measures can add up to create big savings . <p> Common examples of bad habits widely practiced by the public include : leaving lids off whilst cooking on the hob , overfilling the kettle , and leaving appliances on standby . The cumulative effect of the dozens of household appliances with stand-by modes left on continuously has a huge effect on electricity bills . <h> A final Point <p> Another point that has been stressed in previous blogs is that halogen bulbs are not low energy ! They are in fact very inefficient and switching to LED bulbs will save a lot of money , relative to the cost of the bulbs , also since the last significantly longer ( 10-20 years longer ) , you wo n't have to get your ladder out every 6 months to replace a blown bulb !

@@36749262 @5749262/ <h> How should I heat my hot water ? <h> January 5 , 2015 <p> We have covered your home heating options extensively over the years , but here we are going to have a look at- the options you have for your hot water . <h> Boiler <p> Photos of a heater &amp; hot water programmer on the boiler <p> For those with a gas boiler , heating your water this way is going to generally be the cheapest option , just like with your central heating . You will have one of 2 setups " either a combi boiler that heats your hot water on demand , or a boiler with a separate cylinder. - The boiler is a long established means of getting hot water for your home . <h> Instantaneous Hot Water Heater <p> If you do n't have gas central heating , and perhaps live in a flat or smaller property where space is at a premium , having a big old cylinder to heat and store your hot water can be a pain . Instantaneous hot water heaters are a small efficient box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need it . This can be a gas or electric system , depending on the fuel in the property , and you can get single point or multi point heaters " that is , a heater that provides hot water at just one location , or one that provides it for several locations in the home . <h> Immersion Heater <p> If you have a hot water cylinder , you will have an immersion heater . This device heats the water in the cylinder like a kettle using electricity . That makes it quite expensive to run . Not only are you heating the water using a fuel that is 3 or 4 times the price of gas , you are storing that heated water in a container that will gradually leak that heat , making it even more inefficient than an instantaneous heater . <p> Of course , you can reduce this heat loss with a good quality tank with thick insulation , or a woolly jacket . Eventually however , the hot water is lost unless you use it . We recommend that unless your immersion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never turn the immersion on . It is just too wasteful . Just keep it as a backup for when your boiler is on the blink . <h> Solar Thermal <p> Solar thermal is a simple yet effective renewable technology . Your water is passed though a device that utilises the heat of the sun to warm the water and keep it in a thermal store , or large cylinder . You can find out more about solar thermal here . <p> The problem with relying on solar thermal is that during colder months , there wo n't be enough energy in the sun to get the temperature up to a suitable level for showers etc . Most solar thermal systems will be a secondary system with a boiler or heat pump providing additional heat when the sun is n't adequate . <h> Other renewable Options <p> There are other ways of heating your water . Heat pumps are a real emerging technology and are a really efficient way of heating your water . Obviously this is generally a whole house heating solution and not just for hot water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for heating your water is important , the controls are equally so . The last thing you want is to waste energy overheating your water . <p> A cylinder thermostat helps keep the water in your cylinder from overheating . <p> The most basic requirement is a programmer of some sort . Most systems have a dial that let 's you set when the water comes on and off . Make sure you use this wisely and do n't heat water when you do n't need it . <p> Cylinder thermostats are a simple device that sit on your cylinder and cut the heating off when the water hits a preset temperature . This ensures that you are n't overheating your water and wasting energy . <h> What is the best way to heat your water ? <p> There are plenty of options open to you for heating your water .

@@36749263 @5749263/ <h> What is fracking and should we be nervous ? <h> April 18 , 2012 <h> What is Fracking ? <p> I came across the term Fracking only fairly recently , in someone 's tweet on Twitter . I had no idea what it meant at the time , but have since learnt that the US are lapping it up , with the UK expected to follow sharpish . <p> So what is it ? And should the Brits be quite so quick to follow yet another trend from across the pond ? <p> Fracking is short for Hydraulic Fracturing , and is the term used to describe the extraction of gas from shale rock formations . The richest shale deposits tend to be at a depth of 1.5 " 6km underground and at these depths , the high pressure reduces the number of naturally occurring fractures . <p> These are the beds targeted by fracking ; bore holes are drilled vertically down to reach the shale beds ( which tend to be less than 100m thick ) , and then the bore holes turn 900 , aligned horizontally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on for kilometres . <p> Once the bore hole has been drilled , very high pressure water is then forced down into the shale rock which causes lots of miniature explosions , cracking the shale and releasing the gas trapped inside the bed . To prevent the cracks settling back down , sand is then pumped down which props up these artificial fractures . <h> What are the ( potential ) problems with Fracking ? <p> Well , while I mentioned that it was water that was fired down the bore hole , that does make the vast majority ( 98.5% of the fracking fluid ) , but other chemicals are also sent down such as lubricants and anti corrosion chemicals . When the sand is fired down to act as the propping agent , chemicals are needed to ensure that the sand finds its ways into all the fractures , and this process is fulfilled by lubricants and suspension agents . In addition anti corrosion chemicals are also sent down to stop the bore hole pipes corroding . <p> This in itself- wouldnt- be an issue if 100% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some suggestions that this fracking liquid finds its way into water that we eventually drink , which obviously- wouldnt- be ideal . Even on a simpler level , if the water were to find its way into the oceans and sea it could be detrimental to the local environment , causing adverse affects on wildlife . <p> There are also dramatic reports ( I have no scientific proof to shape my view on this ) of water coming out of the tap with a high volume methane , so if you were to have a open flame in the vicinity , the gas would burst into flames , giving the appearance of burning water . <p> In the UK , during April and May 2011 , two small earthquakes hit the Blackpool area ( these were literally tiny " 1.5 &amp; 2.2 magnitude ) which were confirmed to be the direct result of fracking activity in theUK . Now anything less than 2 on the Richter scale is described as a Micro earthquake , and therefore not felt . It appears though that Blackpool residents are light sleepers as 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the tremors ' in the very early hours . <p> I guess for me , it is the last potential issue with fracking that causes me the biggest problem . Fracking produces natural gas , which despite being the cleanest of the fossil fuel family , when burnt produces CO2 and other greenhouse gases . Relying on natural gas is essentially taking a backward step in trying to cut emissions , and make our society greener . <p> In the USA recently , fracking has led to an abundance of cheap fossil fuel gas and this has made Renewables battling to make headway amongst more established fossil fuel competitors more uneconomical and unattractive as investment potential . <p> Also on a slight aside , a further factor making fracking such a popular activity in the USA is that unlike the UK , where any gas found on your property belongs to the crown , any reserves found on properties in the USA belongs to the property owner , potentially creating overnight millionaires . <p> Barack Obama , in his state to union address said the development of natural gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaner and cheaper , proving that we do n't  have to choose between our environment and our economy. Well Mr Obama , I disagree . It is another sticky plaster that may help us through the next 50 years or so . Agreed that it might not matter to you or I , but surely that is pretty selfish with regard to- future generations . <p> So coming back to the UK , where the practise of fracking is still in its infancy , a report came out on 16th April 2012 , highlighting the promise of fracking to bridge our electricity generating needs to the Government , and with very large deposits thought to exist under Wales , it surely is a matter of time until sadly this becomes common practise in the UK too . <p> What do you think ? Do you think we should focus on fracking to power the UK ? <h> 3 comments <p> This glut of N.Am . frackin Gas is simply unsustainable .

Gas and electricity prices are rising above inflation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seem to be going away , with high unemployment and social security cuts also exacerbating the issue . Broadly speaking , with incomes unlikely to rise very quickly in the coming years , and further pressure on public expenditure , the best way to tackle this issue is to build and retrofit more energy efficient homes . <h> The Hills Report <p> All this information comes on the back of the Hills Report last year , that states 200,000 more people are set to be in fuel poverty in the next four years and millions of families could be pushed into even deeper fuel poverty . <p> The report also highlights some important questions on the measurement of fuel poverty . For example , it expresses the belief that fuel poverty is currently measured in a very unhelpful way and that the number of people affected , and how deeply they are affected , should be split into two statistics : <p> It suggests the definition of fuel poor household should be one that has required fuel costs that are above a pre-determined median level and ; <p> Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a- residual income- below the official poverty line . <p> Perhaps this statistic is slightly more difficult to measure , but it is likely to be much more useful than the current 10% of income definition . However the government has been consulting on a change towards this measure since the report was published . <h> What can be done ? <p> To mitigate homes getting into fuel poverty the EPC SAP rating of property should ideally reach a target of 80 points out of 100 . The current UK average is SAP 60 , so clearly many of the most vulnerable are overpaying on fuel bills in their grossly inefficient properties . <p> Around 23% of those in fuel poverty are living in social housing , and one of the key provisions from the report is the push for the Energy Company Obligation ( ECO ) to include social housing . This is now the case and along with the Green Deal , will help improve the situation for thousands of fuel poor people . <h> Is the Green Deal and ECO enough to tackle fuel poverty ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money available ( -1.3bn per year ) , and all the regions of the UK are pressing to get as large a slice of the pie as possible . With ECO in its infancy , there is money available , so it is an ideal time to get your property improved for energy efficiency before the masses get involved . <p> It is quite clear that creating more efficient properties is a much more cost effective and long term solution than trying to regulate energy companies to drop prices when clearly the only way is up ' going forward . <p> The Green Deal and ECO should ensure that a significant number of fuel poor households will be able to better afford their winter fuel bills and have a lasting solution to mitigate them from the effects of energy poverty .

Prices are getting to the point where everyday folk are finding them unaffordable . One of the major problems is that the Government has no energy generation succession planning in place ( no plans to replace lost capacity both coal and nuclear ) , we are going to have to import both gas and electricity and as the proportion of imported fuel increases , this will drive energy prices up at a much faster rate than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can help people become more energy efficient now , then they can prepare themselves better for this . <p> The problem of fuel poverty will get worse before it gets better .

Unlike grants for boilers and insulation however , the RHI and FIT are paid over a number of years in small but regular quarterly payments . <h> Up front cost still an issue for renewables <p> Although in the long run , these incentive payments make renewable technology worthwhile , even profitable , there remains a very high initial cost to install the systems , and the payments do not help offset this . <p> It has led some people to accuse the government of limiting access of these technologies to the people able to shell out anywhere from -4-20,000 up front . That means that those in lower income brackets just simply ca n't afford the technology in the first place , even if it might work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching for statistics , it is very safe to assume that the vast majority of those people with renewable technology in their home are those from more wealthy homes . Whilst it certainly is n't only for the rich , there is certainly a barrier to entry there for those who do n't have easy access to that kind of cash . <h> The Green Deal as a means to offset up front payments <p> This is of course where the government 's Green Deal program comes in . If you cant afford the up front cost , or you ca n't get yourself a competitive loan , then your next option should be to look at the government 's Green Deal finance . The scheme let 's you offset some of the initial cost against your future energy bill . Meaning you could potentially borrow several thousand pounds and pay for some of the cost of solar or heat pumps for example . Let 's take a look at a few examples : <p> Mr Smith wants solar PV for his home . He gets a green deal assessment and finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of the installation . A Green Deal Provider quotes him -6,000 to install the system . That means that instead of paying the full cost of the installation , he will only have to find -3,500 from his own money to pay for the system , with the rest being paid back on his energy bills . <p> Mr Patel lives in an off-gas-grid home with electric heating . He wants an air source heat pump as he knows it is more efficient and he will benefit from the RHI . The cost he is quoted for a new heat pump and underfloor heating is -12,000 . His Green Deal Assessment shows that he will get a loan of -3,100 reducing his up front cost to -8,900 . <p> These two example are pretty optimistic in terms of loan amounts , so you can see that whilst the loan might help reduce some of the up front cost , you may well still be quite a way short of financing your installation . <h> Alternatives that let you install renewables ? <p> If you really ca n't afford any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a government loan , you could look at companies that offer free installations of things like biomass boilers or solar PV , which allow you to benefit from the savings made by the new system on your bills , but allow the installer to keep the RHI or FIT payments for themselves . Obviously this is n't going to be for everyone , but it actually offers a good way to get involved in renewable technologies even if you can not afford the cost of installation , something the Green Deal does n't always offer . 184565 @qwx384565 <p> yes they are rewarding the wealthy . but on the other hand the money has to come from somewhere .
