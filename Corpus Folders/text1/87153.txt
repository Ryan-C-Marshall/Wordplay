@@34527471 @3527471/ <p> The first collection of Shakespeares complete works , known as The First Folio , is arguably the most important- document- in the cultural history of Europe . Without it there would be no such thing as William Shakespeare . It is almost a miracle that the First Folio ( Complete Works of William Shakespeare ) exists at all , given that playwrights tried to keep their plays out of print mainly to avoid them being pirated that Shakespeare never published any of his plays , and that not one of Shakespeares manuscripts has survived . We owe this book and the fact that we have the- texts- of so many of the bards plays to the enterprise of two actors . John Hemminge and Henry Condell , two of Shakespeares friends and fellow actors , edited the collection . <p> The First Folio ( Complete Works of William Shakespeare ) were set out in the three categories of Comedies , - Histories and- Tragedies , a categorisation that still dogs the practice of Shakespeare criticism , education and performance today .

The editors knew Shakespeare and his work intimately and had worked with him for years . The playwright actually mentioned them in his will , leaving them money to buy themselves rings . <p> The Printer and Publisher of the First Folio was William Jaggard and his son Isaac . It was a major venture , both in editing and- printing . It consisted of 36 plays and amounted to 900 pages a huge book . About 500 copies of the First Folio wereprinted- and sold at the price of -1 each . Two hundred and thirty-eight known copies exist today of which a third are in the Shakespeare Folger Library in Washington . The First Folio was- printed- seven years after the death of William Shakespeare in 1616 .

School- children are urged to be ambitious , while employers shake their heads at job candidates who- appear to lack ambition . In these times of gender equality it is seen as quite normal that boys- and girls , men and women , should harbour the same ambitions and are encouraged to pursue- them into the workplace and up the ladder of promotion . <p> The meaning of the word has evolved into something a bit different from its earlier meaning. - In Shakespeare 's time , and in his plays , ambition is not a positive drive . The result of- ambitious behaviour is a downfall through some counter force , as a reaction to it . That often- takes the form of revenge " different kinds of revenge , sometimes by a person , sometimes by- fate , and sometimes by nature . It seems that Shakespeare thought of ambition as a doomed- effort to rise above the ordinary and establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or- woman ) will offend " offend individuals , society or nature " and will therefore have to be- brought down if equilibrium is to be restored . That is essential , although , in Shakespeare , as is- always the case in his plays , it is never quite as simple as that. - <p> In Julius Caesar , as the assassins stand around the slain Caesar 's body , Brutus says , - ambition 's debt is paid . ' The assumption is that a man who acts on his ambitions has to pay- a heavy price for doing so . Brutus is drawn into the conspiracy when Cassius persuades him- that Caesar has to be killed because he is about to stage a coup , about to overthrow the state , - and make himself emperor of Rome . After the assassination Brutus goes out to the people to- explain that the popular general 's ambition had to be countered . He quite genuinely praises- Caesar 's qualities but that one thing " his ambition " could not be tolerated . As Caesar loved- me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoice at it , as he was valiant , I honour him ; but , as- he was ambitious , I slew him . ' <p> That speech begins a debate about ambition in the play . One of Shakespeare 's most famous- speeches , Marc Antony 's Friends , Romans , countrymen , lend me your ears , ' speech follows , - in which Antony disingenuously denies the presence of ambition in Caesar 's actions , seeming- to disprove the ambitious intentions that led to Caesar 's death by a step by step analysis of- Caesar 's acts of valour and generosity , and his love for the people of Rome , while at the same- time pouring doubt on the motives of the assassins . <p> In Shakespeare 's great revenge tragedy , Hamlet , in Claudius ' ambitious bid to become king- he murders his brother , Hamlet 's father . That leads to Hamlet 's decision to bring him down- by avenging his father 's murder . In many of Shakespeare 's tragedies and history plays- ambition plays a role but when we think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great expression of human ambition and its consequences , the play , Macbeth , - and we can use Macbeth as an example of one of the ways Shakespeare uses the theme of- ambition . <p> Ambition in Macbeth is far from a straightforward illustration of the theme . For a start , it- engenders a debate in the mind of the audience as to who the ambitious character is . In terms- of classical tragedy Macbeth fits the bill . He 's a hero , virtually- worshipped- by the other feudal- lords of Scotland . When he gets the idea that he can become king he believes that all he has- to do is kill the king , he will be elected king , and that will be that . The rest of the play works- that idea through and throws up its various complications . In the end the hero , by now- regarded as a hellish villain , is brought down . <p> That is a very simple view of it , and one can , of course , see it that way if one would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what it seems to tell us . But what about Lady Macbeth ? - Macbeth 's basic decency , his nature , full of the milk of human kindness , ' stalls him , as his- rational thinking , with all its implications , almost stops him . However , Lady Macbeth , using- all the tactics at her disposal " her sexuality , emotional blackmail , flattery " ensures that he- carries out the murder . So where does ambition lie in this play ? With him , with her , or with- both ? Perhaps both , but they are two different models of ambition . <p> And then , Macbeth 's downfall . It seems on the surface that he is brought down by a human- force that comes against him , and that makes for a very exciting story , but the downfall is a- revenge for the killing of Duncan that operates on several levels . <p> Apart from the Aristotelian model of a flawed hero who brings about his own downfall by- one of his actions , the protagonist does not live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - which he offends as he goes about murdering a king who holds his position by right , in terms- of the order of things , and by overthrowing the king Macbeth is subverting nature . An- Elizabethan audience would have seen such an act as an unnatural ' deed . They would also- have known that nature and society will both take systematic revenge . Macbeth knows that- and it worries him right from the start . He says : we but teach/Bloody instructions , which- being taught , return/To plague the inventor . ' <p> Ambition , therefore , and the killing of the divinely given king , entails a series of violations of- the natural order , all of which return to haunt Macbeth relentlessly . And nature takes the most- terrible revenge . In violating nature Macbeth forfeits the benefits of its regenerative power. - He becomes an insomniac unable to benefit by the regeneration that sleep brings : he enters a- world of interminable sleepless nights .

@@34527501 @3527501/ <p> Shakespeare- love- sonnets are intensely personal and address the deep issues of life. - Love- is dealt with most comprehensively . Critics over the centuries have been fascinated by the two main subjects of the- lovesentiments " the fair young man ' and the dark lady . ' Scholars have explored the Elizabethan times and Shakespeare 's sonnets to try and identify these two figures and there are several theories , although there is some consensus around the identity of the young man . He seems to have been the Earl of Southampton , Shakespeare 's patron between 1592 and 1595 . <p> It is natural for the imagination to roam over these two living , breathing figures , who Shakespeare knew so intimately , but it is just as interesting to look at the whole body of sonnets to see what insights Shakespeare offers us about the role of- love- in life . As usual , through personal messages , humour , observations of the everyday , and so on , Shakespeare reaches depths in bits of language that have become quotable truths about human life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can see descriptions of three different contexts in which- love- operates . In doing so he depicts a multi-faceted image of- love . <p> Love- in Shakespeares sonnets does not have a single definition , but rather , an intangible collection of characteristics that , together , make up a powerful force that defeats all obstacles . Taking just three of the sonnets- - 116 , - 130 , and- 147 - love- is depicted as an overwhelming force that triumphs over time , the physical world , and reason , respectively . In- sonnet 116 , - love- is given an identity as an immortal force , which overcomes age , death , and time itself. - - Love- is depicted as an invincible force that defies time as well as times effects on beauty and youth , changes such aswrinkles- and old age. - Loves not Times fool , though rosy lips and cheeks/Within his bending sickles compass come ( Lines 9 and 10 ) . - Love , unlike the physical being , is not subject to decay . In sonnet 130 the force of- love- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expands his definition of- love- to include an image of- loveas a force that overcomes social pressures . In sonnet 147 , the speakers reasonable mind is overridden by emotions which arise from his- love- and desire for his absent partner . <p> Returning to the fair young man and the dark lady , we see the depiction of different types of personal- love . Sonnets 1-126 seem to be addressed to an unnamed malefriend , younger than Shakespeare . The intensity of feeling and the language imply a sexual- love , but that is to impose our modern perceptions of sexuality on the poems . Even the most masculine of men were not afraid to express a view of their feelings for other men and admiration of their beauty , unlike the fear modern men have of being thought to be homosexual if they did that . Speculation about Shakespeare 's sexuality is a red herring . In those sonnets , 1-126 , we see a growing friendship with the young man and the development of an intensity of feeling . In sonnets 1-17 Shakespeare seems concerned with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , as the friendship develops and the poet comes to- love- the young man intensely , we see feelings of grief caused by the poet 's separation from him . They live in different worlds : the young man is a nobleman and that , in itself , is cause for a certain kind of separation . Moreover , the young man is idle and wanton , whereas Shakespeare is a hard-working actor , writer and businessman , and that , too , is a major difference in lifestyle and another level of separation . However , these sonnets reveal a deep- lovefor the young man , an admiration of his exceptional physical beauty , and , perhaps , the payment of dues to a benefactor . Whatever the reasons are , the sonnets provide us with some of the finest expressions of- love- in the English language . <p> Then there is the dark lady , referred to as black .

Some scholars have suggested that she never existed but that Shakespeare invented her to express sexual emotionsranging- from intense sexual passion to sexual distaste in sonnets 127-152 . It seems that we will never know the truth . The sonnets depict a painful and erotic relationship in which the poet remains attached to his mistress through a combination of- love , and even stronger lust . But he is often revolted by her . Sonnets- 127 , - 128 and- 130 give taunting compliments to the Dark Lady . And in sonnets- 129 , - 146 , - 147 and- 152 he bitterly rejects her . <p> Whatever the scholarly speculations about the- love- sonnets are , the fact remains that a reading of them offers the most comprehensive and universal treatment of- love- in the English language .

@@34527513 @3527513/ <p> Shakespeare is probably the most famous of all Englishmen . One of the things he is famous for is the effect he had on the development of the- Early Modern English language . For example , without even realising it , our everyday speech is full of- words and- phrases invented by Shakespeare . He was able to do that because English was changing as people modernised it in their normal workaday speech . <p> One of the ways the grammar was changing was that inflectional endings ( suffixes that indicated the words grammatical functions in the way that many modern languages still have ) had largely disappeared. - Modern English was becoming wonderfully flexible and that was the background to the Renaissance explosion of the inventive language we see when we look at the poetry of the time . Shakespeare was a leading figure in that . <p> Writers were able to invent new uses for words with great- freedom . For example , Caesar is able to say : The wild disguise has almost anticked us all. An antic is a fool , which is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fool of. English was being set free to go where writers wanted to take it in their poetry . Shakespeare takes it where he likes throughout his- texts , transforming the English language , pointing to the way we use it today . ( Modern English is still changing and developing , of course , and you are playing a vital role in that as you pick up and use new- phrases , borrow foreign words , incorporate other dialects into your speech and so on . ) <p> There was a huge inflow of other European vocabulary into the English language as a result of Renaissance cross-pollination . That created new variations for English words . It allowed endless possibilities for Shakespeare . In Loves Labours Lost he is able to exploit multiple meanings of one word to create a sentence like Light , seeking light , doth light of light beguile. intellect , wisdom , eyesight and daylight . <p> Generally speaking , the grammar of- Early Modern English is identical to that of- Modern English so there is little difficulty in that regard . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however . Teachers will often find students complaining : All those thees and thous . Its soooo old-fashioned and I ca n't be bothered with it. Once again , this usage was in a state of transition and , as always , Shakespeare exploits that . <p> In- Modern English we use the word " you " as both the singular and the plural form . In- Old English , thou was used for addressing one person ; ye for more than one . You was around then , and while thou and ye were used as a subject of a clause , you was used as the object . By the time of- Early Modern English , the distinction between subject and object uses of ye and you had virtually disappeared , and you became the norm in all grammatical functions and social situations . Ye had become old-fashioned and so , when we see it in the Authorised Bible ( Oh ye of little faith ) we are seeing that , in spite of the fact that you may think you understand the language in the Bible better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By Shakespeares time in- Early Modern English you was being used for both singular and plural , but in the singular it also had a role as an alternative to thou and thee . You was used by people of lower status to those above them ( such as ordinary people to nobles , children to parents , servants to masters ) , and was also the formal way for the upper classes to- talk to- each other . By contrast , thou and thee were used by people of higher rank to those beneath them , and by the lower classes to each other ; also , strangely enough , in addressing God , and in talking to witches , ghosts , and other supernatural beings . As a refection of the higher status of males in the male/female context a husband might address his wife as thou , and she might reply respectfully with you . <p> The use of thou and you also had an emotional dimension . Thou commonly expressed special intimacy or affection ; you , formality , politeness , and distance . That form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vous and tu . Thou might also be used by an inferior to a superior , to express such feelings as anger and contempt or to be insulting and this is one of the areas where Shakespeare is able to get extra levels of meaning by showing disrespect by one character for anothers status .

Sir Toby Belch advises Sir Andrew Aguecheek on how to write a challenge to the Counts youth , Viola : if thou thoust him somethrice , it shall not be amiss ( Twelfth Night ) . ( Read more on this topic on our guide to meanings of thee and thou . ) <p> Shakespeare was acutely aware of the way the- Early Modern English language that he grew up with was changing and it is yet another way that he was able to create the levels of meaning that made him such an enduring writer .

@@34527514 @3527514/ <p> Early Greek comedy was in sharp contrast to the dignity and seriousness of tragedy . Aristophanes , the towering giant of comedy , used every kind of humour from the slapstick through sexual jokes to satire and literary parody . Unlike tragedy , the plots did n't  originate in traditional myth and legend , but were the product of the writers creative imagination . The main theme was political and social satire . Over the centuries- comedy moved away from those themes to focus on family matters , notably a concentration on relationships and the complications of love . Such a universal theme was bound to survive and , indeed , it has travelled well , from Greece through Roman civilization and , with- the Renaissance- preoccupation with things classical , into Renaissance Europe , to England and the Elizabethans , and into the modern world of the twentieth and twenty first- centuries , where we see Greek comedy alive and well in films and television . <p> Shakespeares comedies ( or rather the plays of- Shakespeare- that are usually categorised as comedies ) , just as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any slot .

The highly contrived endings are the clue to what these plays , all very different , are about . <p> Take The Merchant of Venice- for example it has the love and relationship element . As usual there are two couples . One of the women is disguised as a man through most of the text typical of Shakespearean comedy but the other is in a very unpleasant situation a young Jewess seduced away from her father by a shallow , rather dull young Christian . The play ends with the lovers all together , as usual , celebrating their love and the way things have turned out well for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mans life . The Jew , Shylock is a man who has made a mistake and been- forced to- pay dearly for it by losing everything he values , including his religious freedom . It is almost like two plays a comic structure with a personal tragedy embedded in it . The comedy is a frame to heighten the effect of the tragic elements. - The Christians- are selfish and shallow and cruel beyond imagination and with no conscience whatsoever . This is the use of the comic form to create something very deep and dark . <p> Twelfth Night- is similar the humiliation of a man the in-group does n't  like . As in The Merchant of Venice , his suffering is simply shrugged off in the highly contrived comic ending . <p> Not one of these plays , no matter how full of life and love and laughter and joy , it may be , is without a darkness at its heart. - Much Ado About Nothing- , like- Antony and Cleopatra- ( a tragedy with a comic structure ) is a miracle of- creative writing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern invented one , weaving them together into a very funny drama in which light and dark chase each other around like clouds and sunshine on a windy day , and the play threatens to fall into an abyss at any moment and emerges from that danger in a highly contrived ending once again . <p> Like- the tragedies- these plays defy categorisation . They all draw our attention to a range of human experience with all its sadness , joy , poignancy , tragedy , comedy , darkness , lightness , and its depths . 201858 @qwx401858 <p> My cousin is learning about Shakespeare for her GCSEs and the book she chose to write an essay about was Much Ado About Nothing and she is really , really enjoying it .

@@34527515 @3527515/ <p> The development of the sonnet form was originally made as a- love- poem by the Renaissance Italian poet , Francesco Petrarch . It is always the case with immortal writers that they invent forms in response to their strong need to express ideas and emotions for which they can not find an existing form . Petrarch had an overwhelming need for a new way of expressing the various aspects of his- love- for his Laura . He adapted a mediaeval song form to his purpose and the sonnet was born . He squeezed everything he wanted to express on a particular- single- aspect of the- love- he felt into a fourteen line structure that was very concentrated and in which the rhythm and rhyme and metaphorical pattern produced a significant amount of the meaning . <p> The sonnet became popular with poets and the Elizabethans took it up with great enthusiasm after it was introduced into English poetry by Wyatt and Surrey . The Elizabethan poets used it to woo their mistresses and to- display- their poetic skills . Notable among those poets were Edmund Spenser , Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeare was very conscious of his skill in writing sonnets and referred to it constantly in the sonnets themselves , although in a joking manner . He also referred ironically to his skills as poor , as part of his development of complex arguments .

John Donne , catching the spirit of the Jacobean age , with its taste for strong , logical , rational argument , found the sonnet perfect for his intellectual style , for his need to express his- love- for his wife , Anne , for his expression of religious passion , and for his reflections on death . As a result the sonnet came to be the obvious form for short statements on the great emotional themes , like- love , death , war and religion . Poets use it to express their deepest feelings on those matters . The Victorian Jesuit priest , Gerard Manley Hopkins , wrote several sonnets expressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sonnet as much as the Elizabethans did and other great practitioners were Elizabeth Barrett Browning , the Rossettis , and George Meredith . The sonnet is still in use today for powerful short poetic statements about particular aspects of those great themes .

Robinson , Elinor Wylie , and Edna St. Vincent Millay.

The three page will contains three of the six surviving examples of his signature , which authenticated the will . <p> Shakespeares will was very much a conventional will , expressed in the language of lawyers , properly witnessed and registered , and taken to London to the Prerogative Court of Canterbury to be legally validated on 22 June 1616 .

Some commentators have seen that as a lack of affection or a kind of contempt but if you think about it , it must have been his most intimate possession . It was customary for wealthy people to keep a guestroom with the best bed in the house in it . The second best bed was where he and his wife would have slept together , made- love , given birth to their children , and where Shakespeare would have died . Leaving it to her ensured that whatever else happened it belonged to her now and no-one could take it away from her . He knew that she would be looked after , and indeed , in terms of the English Common Law of the time she was entitled to one third of his estate and the use of the matrimonial home for life . There was no point in mentioning it in the will .

She was to receive a further -150 on which her future husband would have no- claim- unless he settled lands on her to the value of -150 . If she had failed to live another three years the -150 would have gone to his granddaughter , Elizabeth Hall . He also left Judith a- silver- bowl , probably a bowl that she was already using as her own or that she had particularly liked . <p> Shakespeare left -30 to his sister , Joan Hart .

He left his sword and other small items to local friends . His lifelong friend and neighbour , Hamnet Sadler , received the money to buy a memorial ring . He left 26 shillings and 8d to each of three business partners and fellow actors , John Hemynges , Richard Burbage and Henry Cundell , so that they could buy rings . <p> Finally , Shakespeare left -10 to the poor of Stratford . <p> So how wealthy was William Shakespeare ? <p> It is almost impossible to work out what the equivalent of each of these sums of money would be worth today , but if we were to look at how much Londoners were paid at the time of Shakespeares death we could get a rough idea .

When you think that an average theatre ticket cost about 2.5pence ( -0.025 ) its almost unbelievable that it- added- up to so much wealth , considering that Shakespeare was only one of several partners in all his theatrical activities .

@@34527528 @3527528/ <p> Revenge in Elizabethan and Jacobean drama is more of a genre than a theme , as it generally- applies to plays that are specifically about revenge . That may be somewhat simplistic , - however , as the plays of that era are never about just one thing . That 's particularly so of- Shakespeare 's plays and , indeed , Hamlet , the greatest revenge play of all time , is about more- things than can be described , even after four hundred years of its existence . Nevertheless , it is- a play that depicts the revenge that a young man plans for the murder of his father . <p> In the second half of the sixteenth century , coinciding with the great age of English drama , - the works of the Roman playwrights were being translated into English . Seneca was of great- interest to English dramatists , particularly the Jacobean writers because his plays were filled- with such horrifying events as cannibalism , incest , rape , and violent death , things that- Jacobean audiences really loved . Most of Seneca 's plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their stories there was a great deal of revenge . In Hippolytus , for- example , Theseus takes revenge on his son for the supposed rape of Phaedra ; in Agamemnon- the ghost of Thyestes urges Aegisthus towards revenge . <p> One of the first English revenge plays of note " a play that is still performed today " is- Thomas Kyd 's 1587 play , The Spanish Tragedy , which became the model for the revenge- plays of his contemporaries . It contains a ghost as one of the dramatic devices , something that- Shakespeare also employed in Hamlet . In both plays that supernatural framework is set- against a protagonist 's struggle to achieve justice by taking direct action . In both plays the- playwrights use the device of a play-within- a-play as a powerful weapon in the protagonist's- effort to move things on . While Hamlet uses it to prove the guilt of his target , Kyd 's hero , - Hieronimo , takes part in the play and stabs the villain in the middle of the performance . <p> Shakespeare 's revenge play , Titus Andronicusis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its unpalatable violence . Audiences could not identify with the methods- of the protagonist , but in Hamlet we have a thoughtful , decent , highly intelligent young man- who would not normally do anyone any harm and , indeed , is unable to perform the violence- that his call to revenge demands . Conventionally , in revenge plays , the avenger is something- of a hero but , in seeking revenge , is himself a killer . In some of the plays the avenger is not in- any way a hero but utterly villainous . It is an interesting situation because although the- avenger has the right to realise justice by taking revenge it is simply not Christian . The- Christian way would always be forgiveness . But forgiveness is not an option in revenge- plays . Shakespeare , of course , as he always does , resolves this problem by having all the- wrongdoers , including Claudius , the murderer of Hamlet 's father , caught in the traps they- have set for the young prince . Hamlet does not have to do a thing to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's death is avenged by the end of the play but there has- been no violence from Hamlet . <p> Interestingly , the difference between Seneca 's revenge tragedies and Shakespeare 's , is that in- the Seneca 's all the bloodshed occurred offstage and was usually reported by a messenger . In- Jacobean tragedies however , violent action had to happen onstage because that 's why the- audiences came to see the play : all the deaths at the end of Hamlet were very much a part of- the play 's attraction to a 17th century audience . In the final scene everyone dies , including- Hamlet and the stage is littered with corpses . And right at the end , a character that has had- almost no role in the action comes onstage and his soldiers carry all the bodies off . <p> If one were to attempt a definition of the revenge tragedy one could say that it is the story of a- disturbed protagonist and his elaborate plan of revenge for the murder of someone close " a- mother , father , brother , sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes the- vengeful ghost of the murder victim appearing to the protagonist ; the protagonist taking- justice into his own hands after other methods fail him ; the heros gradual descent into- madness ; a play within a play that reveals the murderers guilt ; a subtle game of cat and- mouse between the avenger and the murderer ; and a climactic ending in which all of the main- characters die . <p> Even Hamlet , often called Shakespeare 's best play , follows this somewhat simplistic formula. - However , Hamlet is not just entertainment as many of the revenge plays of the time were , but- a deep psychological character study with profound moral reflections . And , of course , with- the language to go with those things " the poetry that we associate with all Shakespeare's- plays .

@@34527541 @3527541/ <p> One of the most difficult problems for talented people who are trying to make their mark in life is that of their rivals and competitors . On the other hand , they also- make friends- among other top people in their field , who help them and influence them . It was no different for Shakespeare and Shakespeares contemporaries . It was impossible that any other playwrights who saw his plays could be anything but enormously impressed , and threatened if they had that kind of personality , so jealousy was something that he , like anyone else in that position , had to contend with . By the same token he enjoyed some friendships among his contemporaries , the flowers of- English Renaissance dramatic writers . The intense rivalry among the playwrights created a golden age of English drama through the Jacobean era . <p> Below is an overview of Shakespeares contemporaries those key figures who were writing at the same time as Shakespeare . <p> Ben Jonson became one of Shakespeares closest friends . Try and imagine that Shakespeare had never existed : its difficult but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen as the golden age of English drama , and perhaps we would now be giving Ben Jonson the kind of attention that Shakespeare enjoys . <p> Shakespeare was the godfather of Ben Jonsons son and Jonson was eating and drinking with his friend in his house in Stratford a few days before Shakespeares death . He was eight years younger than Shakespeare , and like Shakespeare , he did not have a university education . His father died , leaving the family destitute and Jonson took up the trade of bricklaying when he was old enough to work . He gave that up and went to the Netherlands and joined up as a soldier . Tired of that , he returned to England and fell into acting . He was quite a rough fellow : in 1598 he was arrested for killing a fellow actor in a duel , and in 1603 , while performing at the royal court , he was kicked out for unruly behaviour . <p> No-one knows for sure how he came to- meet- Shakespeare but its thought that he submitted a play to Shakespeares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two playwrights hit it off and became close friends . We also know that Shakespeare performed in one of Jonsons plays , Everyman in His Humour , but we do n't  know which role Shakespeare took . Ben Jonson was well travelled and well read and it seems that they talked a great deal about travel and books . Jonson recommended books and lent some to Shakespeare . Shakespeare was a great user of books while writing his plays . <p> Jonson died in 1637 . His legacy is a body of some of the finest plays in the English language and some of the most famous , most quoted , poems . The major plays , which are regularly performed on English stages , are : Every Man in His Humour , Eastward Ho , The Alchemist and Bartholomew Fair . <p> Christopher Marlowe , apart from being a major and brilliant playwright , was an interesting character . Like Shakespeare , and born in the same year , 1564 , he was the son of a middle class skilled worker , in his case , a shoemaker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public school , the Kings School in Canterbury , and then to university , Corpus Christi College , Cambridge . When he left university he became a spy . He achieved considerable celebrity in London after his first success , Tamburlaine ( 1588 ) , and was well known for his elaborate dress and- jewellery . He was a professed atheist , a dangerous thing to be at that time , and when he wrote a pamphlet about inconsistencies in- the bible- he came under investigation . Before he could be brought to trial , however , he was found murdered in Deptford . He was just 29 . It is thought that he was assassinated by government agents . <p> There are still some scholars who argue that Shakespeare did not write the Shakespeare plays that it was someone else and Marlowe is one of the contenders . The theory is that he was n't murdered but changed his identity and that the Shakespeare plays are his . But the plays attributed to Marlow were clearly written by someone with a university education , whereas Shakespeares plays are homespun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone raised in the countryside . <p> Marlowes plays , like Jonsons are regularly performed in English theatres and the most well known are Doctor Faustus , The Jew of Malta , Tamburlaine and Edward II . <p> Robert Greene would hardly be remembered were it not for the fact that something he wrote about Shakespeare is the only surviving comment by a contemporary critic about Shakespeare , and that Shakespeare based the- plot of The Winters Tale on his prose work , Pandosto . In his social allegory , Groatsworth of Wit Bought with a Million of Repentance ( 1592 ) , Greene referred to the young Shakespeare as an upstart crow . <p> Greenes best known plays are The Scottish History of James IV and Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay . <p> Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher are usually thought of together because of their long collaboration . They were younger than Shakespeare , Beaumont born in 1584 and Fletcher in 1579 . They were both university educated and so were somewhat out of place in Londons theatreland . In fact , Fletchers father , Richard Fletcher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge . It is thought that Shakespeare took an interest in the young playwrights and edited some of their plays , which his company performed . Shakespeare evidently admired Fletcher because they collaborated on The Life of King Henry the Eighth , The Two Noble Kinsmen and Cardenio . The latter has been attributed to Fletcher but we now know that it was written in collaboration with Shakespeare . <p> Beaumont and Fletchers legacy is impressive and includes Philsater , The Knight of the Burning Pestle , and The Maids Tragedy among their plays . When Beaumont died in 1616 Webster went on to collaborate with Jonson and Massinger . He was involved in the writing of forty-two plays and died of the plague in 1625 . He is buried in Southwark Cathedral . <p> Philip Massinger , born in 1584 , was generally considered by his contemporaries to be the best playwright of the time , after Shakespeare .

He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his friend and partner , John Fletcher . <h> Thomas Kyd <p> Thomas Kyd , born in 1558 , is remembered for his wonderful , popular and influential play , The Spanish Tragedy , which towers above everything except Shakespeares best plays . It set the standard for that popular form , the revenge tragedy . Indeed , one can see what an important influence it was on Shakespeares great creation , Hamlet . It includes ghosts , insanity , murder , conspiracy and suicide and is a blueprint for the Jacobean plays of cruelty and violence . It is impossible to overerestimate its influence on the development of English drama . He died in poverty in 1594 . <p> John Webster born in 1680 did n't  write many plays , but The White Devil and The Duchess of Malfi are considered to be the two best Jacobean plays and , in hindsight , they define Jacobean drama , with the complexity of their intrigues , their cruelty and violence , and the intelligence of their heroes , who are Iago-like villains .

We 've also pulled together a bunch of facts about the famous soliloquy , and have the 5 most famous film performances of to be or not to be . <p> To be or not to be- is the most famous soliloquy in the works of Shakespeare probably , even , the most famous soliloquy anywhere . That is partly because the opening words are so interesting , memorable and intriguing but also because Shakespeare ranges around several cultures and practices to borrow the language for his images , and because he 's dealing here with profound concepts , putting complex philosophical ideas into the mouth of a character on a stage , communicating with an audience with a wide range of educational levels . <h> To Be Or Not To Be : Original Words Spoken by Hamlet , Act 3 Scene 1 <p> To be , or not to be @ @ by opposing end them ?

Yes , that was the problem , because in that sleep of death the dreams we might have when we have shed this mortal body must make us pause . That 's the consideration that creates the calamity of such a long life . Because , who would tolerate the whips and scorns of time ; the tyrants offences against us ; the contempt of proud men ; the pain of rejected- love ; the insolence of officious authority ; and the advantage that the worst people take of the best , when one could just release oneself with a naked blade ? Who would carry this load , sweating and grunting under the burden of a weary life if it werent for the dread of the after life that unexplored country from whose border no traveller returns ?

So thinking about it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first impulse to end our life is obscured by reflecting on it . And great and important plans are diluted to the point where we do n't  do anything . " <p> What do you think of the modern translation of Hamlets To be or not to be soliloquy above ? Let us know in the comments below . <p> The first six words of the soliloquy establish a balance . There is a direct opposition " to be , or not to be . Hamlet is thinking about life and death and pondering a state of being versus a state of not being " being alive and being dead . <p> The balance continues with a consideration of the way one deals with life and death . Life is a lack of power : the living are at the mercy of the blows of outrageous fortune . The only action one can take against the things he lists among those blows is to end one 's life . That 's the only way of opposing them . Death is therefore empowering : killing oneself is a way of taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slings and arrows of outrageous fortune . Living is a passive state ; dying is an active state . But in order to reach the condition of death one has to take action in life charge fully armed against Fortune so the whole proposition is circular and hopeless because one does not really have the power of action in life . <p> Death is something desirable " devoutly- to be wished , a consummation " a perfect closure . It 's nothing more than a sleep . But there 's a catch , which Hamlet calls a rub . A rub ' is a bowls term meaning an obstacle on the bowls lawn that diverts the bowl , so the fear of the life hereafter is the obstacle that makes us pause and perhaps change the direction of our thinking . We do n't control our dreams so what dreams may come in that sleep in which we have shuffled off all the fuss and bother of life ? He uses the word coil , ' which is an Elizabethan word for a big fuss , such as there may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a lot of things going on and a lot of rushing about . With that thought Hamlet stops to reconsider . What will happen when we have discarded all the hustle and bustle of life ? The problem with the proposition is that life after death is unknown and could be worse than life . It 's a very frightening thought . That 's the obstacle on the lawn and it diverts his thoughts to another direction . <p> And now Hamlet reflects on a final end . A quietus ' is a legal word meaning a final definitive end to an argument . He opposes this Latin word against- the Celtic sweating ' and grunting ' of a living person as an Arab beneath an overwhelmingly heavy load " a fardel , the load carried by a camel . Who would bear that when he could just draw a line under life with something as simple as a knitting needle " a bodkin ? It 's quite a big thought and it 's fascinating that this enormous act " drawing a line under life can be done with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy that seems . <p> Hamlet now let 's his imagination wander on the subject of the voyages of discovery and the exploratory expeditions . Dying is like crossing the border between known and unknown geography . One is likely to be lost in that unmapped place , from which one would never return . The implication is that there may be unimagined horrors in that land . <p> Hamlet now seems to make a decision . He makes the profound judgment that conscience does make cowards of us all , ' This sentence is probably the most important one in the soliloquy . There is a religious dimension to it as it is a sin to take one 's life . So with that added dimension the fear of the unknown after death is intensified . <p> But there is more to it than that . It is not just about killing himself but also about the mission he is on " to avenge his father 's death by killing his father 's murderer . Throughout the action of the play he makes excuses for not killing him and turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowards of us all . ' Convention demands that he kill Claudius but murder is a sin and that conflict is the core of the play . <p> At the end of the soliloquy he pulls himself out of this reflective mode by deciding that too much thinking about it is the thing that will prevent the action he has to rise to . <p> This is not entirely a moment of possible suicide . It 's not that he 's contemplating suicide as much as reflecting on life , and we find that theme all through the text . In this soliloquy life is burdensome and devoid of power . In another it 's weary , stale , flat and unprofitable , ' like a garden overrun with weeds . In this soliloquy Hamlet gives a list of all the things that annoy him about life : the whips and scorns of time , the oppressor 's wrong , the proud man 's contumely , the pangs of despised- love , the law 's delay , the insolence of office and the spurns that patient merit of the unworthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this soliloquy that however bad life is we 're prevented from doing anything about it by fear of the unknown . <h> Facts About To Be Or Not To Be ' <p> 1 .

The English theatre was thriving as well as any industry of the time , complete with about twenty London theatres and scores of playwrights feeding them with new material every week . <p> By the time James came to the throne the theatre had become a favourite leisure activity in London , but the appetites of the theatre-going public were changing . Audiences loved the humour and the many human situations " the tragic and comic dramas that were unfolding before them on the stage .

Audiences flocked in to see those representations of the society in which they lived , dramatised in exciting titillating stories , full of sex and violence . <p> And so we have such plays as John Webster'sThe White Devil and The Duchess of Malfi , with their highly intelligent characters perpetrating crimes and acts of violence in the pursuit of their ambitions .

She was pregnant at the time and whatever their relationship was like " which we do n't  know anything about " he had no alternative other than to marry her because it was socially unacceptable for a woman of her standing to have- a child without being married . <p> Anne Hathaway was the eldest of the eight children of a farmer , Richard Hathaway. - They lived in a big farmhouse , called Hewland Farm in the village of Shottery , one mile from Stratford . When Richard died in 1581 she continued to live with her siblings and step-mother in the farmhouse , which is now known as Anne Hathaways cottage " one of the most visited tourist buildings in England .

Anne lived the life of what would be the equivalent , in our times , of a millionaires wife and enjoyed the prestige that came with having a successful and very wealthy husband. - In 1596 her husband bought , and moved the family into , New Place , one of the biggest houses in town. - On his retirement in 1610 Shakespeare settled in Stratford and lived the last six years of his life as a family man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shakespeares enjoyed a rich social life , visited by some of the most glittering stars of the age , men like Ben Jonson and Michael Drayton , whose names are still among the most famous as literary figures . <p> After Shakespeares death in 1616 Anne continued to live in New Place as a wealthy widow , until her death in 1623 , aged sixty-seven .

There 's no confirmation of why Hamnet died . Accidents were the leading cause of death in Elizabethan era childhoods .

Setting for part of Shakespeares The Merchant of Venice <p> We recently mapped the locations of all 37 of Shakespeares plays. - The most interesting thing about looking at the map is just how broadly Shakespeare cast his creative web- across different cultures and languages inthe search for suitable material for his dramas . <p> In fact over three quarters of Shakespeares plays are set outside of the UK , with a geographic spread north to south- from Denmark to Lybia and west to east from Spain to Syria. - Some of those are set in Shakespeare 's own time , some in Medieval Europe and some in ancient Europe . The Greek and Roman Empires feature in many of the history plays , with action taking place in north Africa ( Lybia and Egypt ) and what we now refer to as the Middle East ( Lebanon , Syria &amp; Turkey ) . <p> Of the plays that are set in the UK ( England , Wales and Scotland none in Ireland ) only one is set in Elizabethan England " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that play may give a clue as to why Shakespeares plays are set either abroad or in the distant past . The Merry Wives is pure comedy " farce , actually " and has nothing to say about politics , other than sexual and family politics . It ca n't in any way engender any feelings in monarchs or other powerful political figures other than to make them laugh . <p> Most of the other plays are seriously political . Shakespeare lived in very dangerous times " in times when to criticise powerful rulers could mean imprisonment at the very least and execution at worst . But think about it : how can you write something on a political theme without doing criticising power ? The answer is to set your play either in a foreign country or in the distant past . You can then criticise your own monarch , who is disguised as a foreign ruler in the play . The same goes for the plays set in historical Britain " you can give those historical kings some of the villainous ways of your own monarch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You still have to be careful though . For example , King James was James VI of Scotland and James I of England at the same time , hence the united kingdoms . Shakespeare made his Scottish king , Macbeth , a tyrant and a butcher . He balanced that by reference to the English king who is described in terms of holiness and saintliness , and who sponsors the military overthrow of Macbeth . King James , who certainly saw the play , would have been sitting back with a feeling of saintliness himself . <p> If Shakespeare had set political plays in England in his own time we would never have seen them " nor would the Elizabethan audience , as the plays would have been banned by the censors. - But there are a couple of other reasons why so many of Shakespeare plays are set in Europe . <p> The first is a very simple one : Shakespeare rarely bases plays on stories that he has himself made up " almost all the stories come from somewhere else . He takes them and works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process , introducing new characters into them , and so on . He almost always leaves the stories in the settings in which he finds them . Some of the stories are very famous , such as the very old story of Hamlet , Prince of Denmark , which there was no way he could have set anywhere other than Denmark . The same goes for Julius Caesar , Antony and Cleopatra and the other plays set in the ancient world . <p> The second reason so many of Shakespeares plays were based abroad was to do with the- strong prejudices and expectations that - Elizabethan audiences had , particularly around Italy . In Shakespeares time , if the public saw that a play was set somewhere in Italy and the characters were Italian they immediately sat up and took notice . They knew that the action would be extremely violent and there would be extreme passions that would sweep them up emotionally and hold them in that intense world for a couple of hours . Because of this Shakespeare uses Italy as a backdrop ( at least in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So although its a hotly debated topic just how much travel Shakespeare did and , indeed whether he ever made it to Italy , or any other countries he based his plays there are at least 3 good reasons as to why so many of Shakespeares plays are set outside of the UK : <p> 1 . He couldt get away with writing plays which critisized Kings and rulers in his own country and time . <p> 2 . Many of the plays Shakespeare wrote came from traditional stories , and required a specific setting outside of the UK . <p> 3 . In Shakespeares time Italy in particular had a reputation for violence and passion that would pull in the Elizabethan punters . 201858 @qwx401858 <p> Very nice analysis , and I am happy that I could hit the internet and find something intelligently written on this question ( it cam to my mind because I saw a fine , energetic but happy ( ish ) production of Taming of the Shrew this evening , of course there 's Romeo and Juliet , etc , etc , but it struck me as oddI surmised the reason

@@34527555 @3527555/ <p> When the fresh-faced youth , William Shakespeare , arrived in the great city of London from the market town of Stratford-upon-Avon to pursue his ambition to be an actor , he fell in with two young men who were working in the theatre . One was Christopher Marlowe , the same age as Shakespeare , who was already writing plays , and the other was the older Ben Jonson . <p> Jonson was an experienced man of the world a poet and soldier , who had fought in several campaigns in Europe . First and foremost a writer of poems , Jonson was now turning his talent to the lucrative business of writing plays for the theatre . <p> Taken under the wing of these two writers the young William Shakespeare was invited to collaborate with Marlowe in writing plays , thus enjoying a valuable apprenticeship as a playwright . He may have performed in one of Marlowe 's plays but there is evidence that he did in at least one of Jonsons plays . He took a role in Jonson 's Every Man in His Humour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know which of them he played . Marlow was murdered soon after Shakespeare 's arrival in London but the friendship between Shakespeare and Jonson developed and remained solid for the duration of Shakespeare 's life . In fact , Jonson visited Shakespeare in Stratford a week before his Shakespeares death . <p> It is possible that if Shakespeare had never existed Ben Jonson 's plays would be regarded as the great examples of Elizabethan drama . He was a very different kind of writer , though . Whereas Shakespeare 's texts are baroque in their elaborations Jonson 's have a more sparse , cut-down , quality , with far more prose than Shakespeare 's , making them seem more modern to the twenty-first century ear . <p> The plays are lively and mainly comic : they reflect the author 's interest in current affairs and the new sciences like geography .

He was more prolific , though , in the masque form - that was taking the Jacobean theatre by storm with its multi-media presentations " poetry , drama , comedy , music , dance and colourful sets . Thirty-six of those have survived . <p> The masques are not much performed today but the regular performance of the most famous of his plays makes him a giant of the Elizabethan and Jacobean theatre , second only to Shakespeare . <p> Here is a list of Ben Jonsons plays : <p> A Tale of a Tub , 1596 <p> The Isle of Dogs , 1597 <p> The Case is Altered , 1597 " 98 <p> Every Man in His Humour , 1598 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cynthias Revels , 1600 <p> The Poetaster , 1601 <p> Sejanus His Fall , 1603 <p> Eastward Ho , 1605 <p> Volpone , 1605-6 <p> Epicoene , or the Silent Woman , 1609 <p> The Alchemist , 1610 <p> Catiline His Conspiracy , 1611 <p> Bartholomew Fair , 1614 <p> The Devil is an Ass , 1616 <p> The Staple of News , 1626 <p> The New Inn , or The Light Heart , 1629 <p> The Magnetic Lady , or Humors Reconciled , 1632 <p> The Sad Shepherd , 1637 <p> Mortimer His Fall , 1641 <p> The most performed of Ben Jonsons plays are : - Every Man in His Humour , Volpone , The Alchemist and Bartholomew Fair

Indeed , Twelfth Night is in many ways a play about pain . Often referred to as- one of the happy plays ' it is full of loss " loss of love , the loss of life , with the full- complement of pain that involves .

The- climax of the play may seem like the conventional happy resolution of the lovers ' problems- but in the middle of all that is the suffering figure of Malvolio , abused by those who are- celebrating their restoration to happiness . <p> Much Ado About Nothing stresses love 's pain . It is in many ways a play about the battle- between male and female , where the men are a band of brothers , bachelors incessantly joking- about infidelity , using the language of sex in their bachelor bantering and being careless in- their relationships with women .

King Lear is a play- that makes one almost believe that when Shakespeare sat down to write it he made a list of- every painful thing that human beings could do to each other . No Shakespeare play is about- one thing and , of course , King Lear is one of the most comprehensive plays about human life , - but it is also very much about suffering .

It has the structure of a common fairy-tale " a king , with three daughters , subjects- them to a love test in which the ones who loves him are rewarded but the youngest rebels- against that and the story goes from there .

Shakespeare- keeps us thinking that there may be a happy ending but the ending is even more suffering . <p> The play is postmodern in many ways , not least in that the expectation of a happy ending , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ending , is subverted . The- play consistently denies us the patterns Shakespeare deliberately encourages us to expect , and- in that way the suffering is intensified .

But then Cordelia is- executed and the play ends with the most excruciating of all suffering " the death of one's- child , something all human beings think of as the worst thing that could happen to anyone . <p> And in the frustration of our expectations Shakespeare is holding his text up as a mirror in the- most painful way possible .

Indeed , the argument maintains that the other members of the Shakespeare family , including William 's parents , wife and daughters , were illiterate and it 's impossible that someone with such a facility for language could have grown up and lived a family life in those circumstances . <p> When the advocates of Shakespeare as the author of the plays point out that Shakespeare had a good education in the classics , the Latin language , - rhetoric and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no evidence of his attendance there .

No-one suggests that someone else wrote Ben Jonson 's plays , and neither Ben Jonson nor any other of Shakespeare 's contemporaries suggested that their colleague , William Shakespeare , whom they knew well , did not write the plays performed in his name . Moreover , not only did Shakespeare 's name appear on the title pages of poems and plays but he was referred to at least twenty-three times in different documents . Also , there is substantial documentary evidence attesting to the author having been the same Shakespeare whose home was in Stratford . For example , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his- Palladis Tamia , referring to him as one of the authors by whom the English tongue is mightily enriched , ' and he names twelve plays written by Shakespeare , including one , - Love 's Labours Won , that has been lost . <p> A powerful argument in favour of Shakespeare being the author of the plays is that there are records from his lifetime of books of his plays being printed , his authorship being attested to by the official stationers . There are at least three such references , referring to the printing of- Much Ado about Nothing , - Henry IV Part 2- and- King Lear , and also to their performances at the Globe . <p> Mainstream Shakespeare scholars maintain that- the convergence of documentary evidence for Shakespeare 's authorship " title pages , testimony by other contemporary poets and historians and official records " is the same as that for any other author of the time . No such supporting evidence exists for any other candidate , - and Shakespeare 's authorship was not questioned during his lifetime or for centuries after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof of Shakespeare 's role of playwright than records of the acknowledgement of that by his friends and colleagues . Score of actors and writers referred to him , identifying him as a writer . After his death there were several eulogies that spoke of his work by poets like Hugh Holland , Leonard Digges , and most convincing , Shakespeare 's friend and- workmate , Ben Jonson : - - To the Memory of My Beloved the Author , Mr William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us , - published in the First Folio in 1623. 201858 @qwx401858 <p> Much of the foregoing comments are absolutely ridiculous in my estimation . If you are going to doubt the historical existence of Shakespeare , who died merely 501 years ago , we all may as well disbelieve the historical existence of such notable figures as Jesus Christ , whose death was approximately 2,000 years ago . Furthermore , it appears that many of the comments are left by people who would not accept the actual and very real existence of anyone who does not actually live in their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another useless Conspiracy Theory that has absolutely no basis in factual , historical reality . Wake up people ! If you persist , you surely do not accept the historical existence of Mozart , Beethoven , Napoleon , Robespierre , and an ever-continuing list of remarkable people who have shaped our very modern world . Give this enough time and perhaps there will be a nonsensical debate about the historical existence of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates ! Good riddance to this foolish debate !

@@34527569 @3527569/ <p> Just as- Shakespeares comedies- have some dark themes and tragic situations while- the tragedies- have some high comic moments , the Shakespeares history plays contain comedy , tragedy and everything in between . All Shakespeares plays are dramas written for the entertainment of the public and Shakeseares intention in writing them was just that to entertain . It was n't Shakespeare , but Shakespearian scholars , who categorised his plays into those areas of tragedy , comedy and history as well as problem and Roman . Unfortunately , our appreciation of the plays is often affected by our tendency to look at them in that limited way . <p> Most of the plays have an historical element the Roman plays , for example , are historical but scholars do n't  refer to those Roman plays ( Julius Caesar , - Antony and Cleopatra , - Coriolanus- etc. ) as history plays . The plays that we normally mean when we refer to the history plays are the ten plays that cover English history from the twelfth to the sixteenthcenturies , and the 1399-1485 period in particular . Each play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monarch of the period . <p> The plays dramatise five generations of Medieval power struggles . For the most part they depict the Hundred Years War with France , from Henry V to Joan of Arc , and the Wars of the Roses , between York and Lancaster . <p> We should never forget that they are works of imagination , based very loosely on historical figures . Shakespeare was a keen reader of history and was always looking for the dramatic impact of historical characters and events as he read . Today we tend to think of those historical figures in the way Shakespeare presented them . For example , we think of Richard III as an evil man , a kind of psychopath with a deformed body and a grudge against humanity . Historians can do whatever they like to set the record straight but Shakespeares Richard seems stuck in our culture as the real Richard III . Henry V , nee Prince Hal , is , in our minds , the perfect model of kingship after an education gained by indulgence in a misspent youth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the way Shakespeare chose to present him in the furtherance of the themes he wanted to develop and the dramatic story he wanted to tell . In fact , the popular perception of mediaval history as seen through the rulers of the period is pure Shakespeare . We have given ourselves entirely to Shakespeares vision . What would Bolingbroke ( Henry IV ) mean to us today ? We would know nothing of him but because of Shakespeares plays he is an important , memorable and significant historical figure . <p> The history plays are enormously appealing . Not only do they give insight into the political processes of Mediaval and Renaissance politics but they also offer a glimpse of life from the top to the very bottom of society the royal court , the nobility , tavern life , brothels , beggars , everything . The greatest English actual and fictional hero , Henry V and the most notorious fictional bounder , Falstaff , are seen in several scenes together .

Because although Shakespeare was writing history , using historical figures and events , what he was really doing was writing about the politics , entertainments and social situations of his own time . A major feature of Shakespeares appeal to his own generation was recognition , something Shakespeare exploited relentlessly . <p> U say that some of Billie Shakers comedies contain " dark themes " . Couldnt u rewrite it as dour , or grim ? . Some folks are darkly-skinned and , as a caring sharing human I diss even casual racism . As , I am sure do u . Cool ? . 
@@34527570 @3527570/ <p> In case you werent 100% sure , a soliloquy is the- act of a character speaking their thoughts aloud , often when they 're by themselves but sometimes with others around . Soliloquys ( or soliloquies you can spell them both ways ) differ from monolgues in that the words spoken are thoughts only , and no other characters can hear them . This compares to monolgues which are simply long speeches by a character ( read an in-depth article on soliloquies vs monologues ) . Shakespeare frequently makes use of both soliloquys and monolgues in his plays . <p> The links below lead to extracts from our modern English Shakespeare ebooks , making Shakespeares most well known soliloquies available so you can fully understand his plays .

@@34527575 @3527575/ <p> A pun ' is usually defined as a play on words , or a play upon words , but it would be more accurate to describe punning as playing with the sound of words to achieve particular effects . Those effects can be amusement , thought provocation , clarification or explanation . Puns can also achieve a combination of two or more of those effects . In Shakespeare 's works puns are often an important part of the economy of his poetic texts . <p> Shakespeare 's plays and his sonnets are crammed with puns . Many of them are among the most quoted phrases in the English language : for example , the opening lines of Richard III Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this sun of York , ' where the speaker , Richard , is referring to himself , a son of the house of York .

' <p> When Mercutio , stabbed by Tybalt when Romeo gets in the way of their play fighting , is dying , no-one believes that he is badly hurt because he continues with his joking while he is bleeding to death . Just before he dies he makes a final joke , about his death , retaining his sense of humour even in his last moment . It is both amusing and serious . He tells his companions that he may be a joker but ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man .

The most intelligent of Shakespeare 's characters use them liberally to make sense of the world around them , as Shakespeare does to explain the world that he sees around himself . <p> And so , Hamlet , perhaps Shakespeare 's most intelligent character , is also Shakespeare 's greatest punster . Hamlet is funny in making his serious points , although sometimes he makes puns just to annoy the people around him . Sometimes he does both at the same time . <p> Here are four examples of Hamlet 's puns : some of them are complex and go very deep . <p> After he has killed Polonius and stowed his body away the king asks him where Polonius is . Hamlet tells him he is at supper " not where he eats , but where he is eaten , ' meaning that Polonius is the supper " for worms . <p> Wandering in a graveyard , Hamlet asks a gravedigger whose grave it is he 's digging .

Hamlet states it like this : A little more than kin , and less than kind . ' <p> Hamlet is annoyed by Claudius ' constant referral to him as his son , so when Claudius asks him how is it that the clouds still hang over you ?

If you held political or religious- views that differed from the authorised ones your life would be in danger . The Elizabethans- were used to that and so deception was a way of life . If you were a Catholic you would have- to conceal it . You would have to pretend to support the Protestant religion and attend church- regularly . But you could attend mass in private houses , conducted by priests who were- disguised as someone else .

Wearing masks was another strong convention . The audience knew that if someone had- a mask over his or her eyes , although they would know who the character was , the other- characters would not recognise him/her . That led to many , mainly comic , situations which- would have an effect on the development of the plot . <p> Deception in Shakespeare 's plays has many different faces .

@@34527584 @3527584/ <p> Understanding Shakespeares Problem plays requires a brief , general overview of the play types . Placing any of Shakespeare 's plays into any of the familiar categories , such as- tragedy or comedy , is difficult . Categorising them is nothing more than a modern convenience , although- Shakespeare himself , or at least the editors of the First Folio , named many of the plays- as tragical ' or comical ' or tragical comical . ' <p> Modern critics do n't take much notice of- those Jacobean handles because his plays were unique , and although many of them resemble- forms like Greek comedies or tragedies , it 's not a clear cut issue . Nevertheless , we generally- talk about a Shakespeare comedy or a Shakespeare tragedy and we broadly know what we mean by that . In spite of almost none of the plays sitting entirely comfortably in either of- those categories there is usually enough comic or tragic satisfaction in some of them to place- them there . <p> When we call a play a History Play we are ducking the issue because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mediaeval times , and are easy to recognise as- historical dramas . All of those plays contain elements of tragedy or comedy but we don't- have to wrack our brains to try and make sense of our confusion about what kind of dramas- they are . We just call them History Plays and that 's that . <p> Similarly , with the Roman Plays , we give that name to Julius Caesar , Coriolanus and Antony- and Cleopatra , the three plays set in the ancient Roman world . Here , again , we do n't have- to think about it . They are all set in Ancient Rome and there 's no cause to puzzle over- them . Antony and Cleopatra is generally classified as a tragedy as well and goes into both- categories . Julius Caesar is often referred to as a Problem Play . <p> The nineteenth century Norwegian playwright , Henrik Ibsen produced what he called problem plays ' as an aspect of the new realism ' that was fashionable at the time . The- protagonist in those plays is not a tragic or comic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of a representative of a contemporary social problem . Shakespeare scholars- and critics pounced on the term as a language in which to analyse the Shakespeare texts that- did n't fit into the convenient categories " plays that caused uneasiness when critics were- trying to express what they were . <p> In the Promlem Plays there are n't the happy endings that one would expect in a comedy , nor- the tragic effect one would expect in a tragedy : it 's extremely difficult to talk about any of- Shakespeare 's plays as pure tragedy or pure comedy . For example , in the most perfect of- Shakespeare 's comedies , Twelfth Night , where the loving couples ' problems are resolved and- they all end up with the prospect of living happily ever after , we are left with Malvolio whose- life they have destroyed , and also , Sir Toby Belch , who marries Maria at the end , is not one- of the happy people . In The Merchant of Venice too , there is a strong comic ending for some- of the characters , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is destroyed , while also- not being a tragic figure , although having some of the qualities of a tragic figure . <p> So there is a sense in which a number of Shakespeare 's plays have the features of the problem play , ' but the term has become associated with the few of them that completely- frustrate any attempt to classify them . Without having a fully-fledged tragic hero because our- attention is diverted from a potential tragic figure by the wide range of character issues that- comedies have , a play can not be classified as a tragedy : the tragic effect can only be achieved- when everything is concentrated on the hero , which we get in plays like Macbeth . <p> So what exactly makes a Problem Play ? In the Problem Plays the journey we take when we watch them we take on a dark road . While- most of the protagonists end up in a reasonable place they are almost irretrievably scarred by- the experience we have watched them endure . For example , in Measure for Measure , Isabella- is placed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her brother from execution for- fornication , at the hands of the hypocritical Angelo , she falls prey to Angelo 's lust . He offers- to free her brother if she will sleep with him . The matter is finally resolved , and like the- couples in the comedies , she ends up with a husband , the Duke . He is a good , kind man , - but she has no choice in it , and when he tells her he is going to marry her right at the end- of the play , we do n't see her response . Moreover , their union seems to be a tacked on affair- because there has been no lead-up to it . Although the characters are paired off in the comic- mode , they are not the happy young lovers of the comedies , who have come through a series- of misunderstandings and minor problems in their relationships , but are nevertheless in- love . Moreover , the Duke forces Angelo to marry a woman he has abused , having made her- pregnant then abandoning her . Neither of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry his whore . These are the kind of issues that make a play a problem when trying to- place it in a category . <p> " the Duke forces Angelo to marry a woman he has abused , having made her pregnant then abandoning her . Neither of them is happy . He also forces a scurrilous pimp to marry his whore . " <p> This part is an error . Angelo did not make Mariana pregnant , he abandoned her because she lost her dowry . Lucio is the man who impregnated a woman outside of wedlock and was forced to marry her ; that woman being a prostitute . 
@@34527585 @3527585/ <p> The term , Shakespeares Roman Plays- is simply a convenient description that critics have given to the three plays that Shakespeare set in ancient Rome . <p> The plays are Antony and Cleopatra , Coriolanus , Julius Caesar and Titus Andronicus . What they have in common is that they are all set in ancient Rome and that their source is the Roman historian , Plutarch , translated by the Renaissance English writer , North . Shakespeare actually copied passages from North , for example Enobarbus ' description of Cleopatra ( The barge she sat in . in Antony and Cleopatra ) . He alters that piece of text , adapting it to his purposes with additional imagery and by casting it into his own metrical pattern . <p> Another feature of the Roman plays is that it was customary in Shakespeare 's time to use Roman costume on the stage to re-enforce the impression that we are in Rome . Usually , costume was n't an important issue : the characters came on dressed in contemporary clothes , for the most part , although social class was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of material for the nobility , and merchant and peasant dress accordingly . It 's an interesting fact that when actors wore the clothing of a nobleman or a king they were technically breaking the law , as there were strict laws forbidding the use of such clothing if you were n't a member of that class . <p> The three plays are always referred to as the Roman Plays , which conceals a number of issues : for example , what kind of plays were they ? For example , Antony and Cleopatra is often regarded as a tragedy , or because , like Romeo and Juliet , the tragedy concerns two lovers who suffer equally , a double tragedy ' . But even here , the term tragedy ' refers to a form of Greek tragedy which some of Shakespeare 's plays , like Macbeth , strongly resemble , but none of them fits neatly into any category . Antony and Cleopatra , for example , produces strong tragic feelings in the audience but it 's actually written with a comic structure . It 's one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a central character , Brutus , who looks very much like a tragic figure but there are too many issues explored in the play for it to be termed a tragedy . It 's therefore convenient to take hold of the ancient Roman setting and call these plays Roman Plays . ' <p> The plays all explore power . They also examine things like loyalty , war , love , friendship and honour .

@@34527598 @3527598/ <p> The simple definition of Elizabethan drama is that it is drama written during the reign of Elizabeth I , but that is absurdly simplistic : Elizabethan drama is much more than that . <p> Queen Elizabeth I of England and Ireland reigned from 1558 to 1603 , during the time when Europeans were starting to break out of the cultural constraints imposed by the mediaeval Church . Great thinkers across Europe were courageously directing their eyes away from the face of God and turning them towards the mind , the form and the ideas of human beings in a huge humanistic movement . Instead of just accepting the flat , two dimensional assumptions about life , God , the planet and the universe itself that the Church pedalled , they were challenging those assumptions and that led to a blossoming of new perceptions in every area of human endeavour " art , music , architecture , religion , science , philosophy and literature . Artists , composers , scientists and writers looked back beyond the darkness of fourteen centuries and took their inspiration from the humanist qualities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama <p> The Renaissance flowered right across Europe but had different emphases in the different European cultures " it was religion and philosophy in Germany , for example ; art , architecture and sculpture in Italy . And in England it was drama . All through the Middle Ages English drama had been religious and didactic . When Elizabeth came to the throne most of the plays on offer to the public were Miracle Plays , presenting in crude dialogue stories from the Bible and lives of the saints , and the Moralities , which taught lessons for the guidance of life through the means of allegorical action . They were primarily dramas about God , not about people . <p> By the time Elizabeth 's reign ended there were more than twenty theatres in London , all turning over several plays a week plays that were secular in their nature , and about people . That represented a complete revolution in theatre . What changed at that time was that the theatre became a place where people went to see , not dramatised lectures on good behaviour , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They wanted to laugh and to cry " to be moved , not by divine reflection , but by human beings doing good and bad things just as they did loving and murdering , stealing , cheating , acting sacrificially , getting into trouble and behaving nobly : in short , being human like themselves . <p> This new Elizabethan drama and theatre attracted writers of great calibre who thought of themselves simply as craftsmen in the same way as coopers or wheelwrights did , and not great writers , ' as we think of them today . But even so , most of the theatre writers of Elizabethan England have not been equalled during the four centuries since that time . There was a lot of money to be made feeding this huge new appetite and good playwrights who played their cards well and made good contacts as Shakespeare did became rich . <p> So when we look back at Elizabethan drama from the twenty-first century what do we see ? We see , for the first time , stage presentations of the human experience . We see acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Greek tragedy perfected by Shakespeare in such plays as Hamlet , Macbeth , King Lear etc . We see human beings at their meanest level ; we see psychological studies of the human character , such as the psychopathic Iago in Othello ; we see the exploration of the deepest human emotions , such as love in Romeo and Juliet and Anthony and Cleopatra . Although most of the plays of the period have an underlying Christian assumption because of the culture of the time in which they were written they are essentially humanist , in tune with the Renaissance spirit of the time . <p> In Elizabethan drama , because it is about people rather than God , we see a lot of humour . Again , modelled on the Greek comedies , the humour is perfected by the likes of Shakespeare and Ben Jonson with their memorable comic characters and their satirical look at their own time , as well as light-hearted social comedies . In Shakespeare 's plays there is humour even in the darkest plays , such as the frequent laugh ' lines in Hamlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mixed all genres so that his tragedies contain comic elements , his comedies tragic elements , and his histories contain both . In Shakespeare 's case the winds of Renaissance gave him the freedom to reflect all aspects of human beings in his plays , and he wrote plays that have not only lasted for four hundred years but which have very rarely ( if at all ) been bettered during that time . <p> Towards the end of Elizabeth 's reign playwrights were developing new themes and techniques which led to the distinctive Jacobean theatre with its more crusty , violent plays that focused on the human being 's capacity for selfishness , dramatised in in-depth representations of ambition and its effects . 
@@34527599 @3527599/ <p> All Shakespeare 's plays have transformation at their heart and we see that in his texts in- several ways . <p> The most visible manifestation of transformation in the plays stems from Shakespeare 's pre-eminence in creating inner lives for his characters that are complex and evolving as they react- to events . Before Shakespeare , literature did not present us with characters whose inner lives- demand our deepest attention . But we see in Shakespeare 's plays so many characters who are- in the process of reacting to events and developing , as we watch them , in ways no other- characters in literature before Shakespeare did , because Shakespeare 's assumptions about- character were different from those of earlier writers . Earlier characters had personality- structures , and while they did react to events , we do n't see process and the development of- understanding in them that we see in Shakespeare 's characters . That development of- understanding in Shakespeare 's characters is responsible for the transformation we see in all- of them . With Hamlet , Othello , Macbeth , and Lear especially , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of our way of understanding human beings . <p> Shakespeare 's positioning as a Renaissance writer places him in the context of rapid change. - The world in which he lived was fast transforming itself in science , art , philosophy , religion , - medicine and many other areas . It was in the middle of the Copernican revolution , the- Machiavellian influence , geographic exploration , and dynamic social change . Shakespeare's- characters begin to display a Machiavellian duplicity , or are concerned with , or promote , as- we see in King Lear , both a concern for the preservation , and the dismantling of , the received- Elizabethan world view . In many characters we see the impulse to replace it with a modern , - science-based sensibility . Living in the times he did means that Shakespeare could not have- done anything else than have his characters respond .

In Twelfth Night Malvolio is- tricked by a false letter into changing from a puritan steward to a ridiculous would-be lover ; - in A Midsummer Night 's Dream Nick Bottom is magically transformed into an ass. - In every play characters change in some way : it could be the change from life to death , or the- dawning of new insights . Figures of power come tumbling down and villains are exposed . <p> None of Shakespeare 's plays is about one thing : every play is criss-crossed with a multitude- of themes , so if one tried to explain a Shakespeare text in terms of one idea it would be- simplistic .

In the process he is himself transformed and at the end of the play he- demonstrates his complete , permanent transformation by renouncing his magic and its agents . <p> After twelve years of anger and bitterness at his banishment and imprisonment on a small- island with his young daughter , Miranda , he now has the opportunity to take revenge on those- who have done him wrong .

In letting go of his resentment and forgiving the- wrongdoer , he let 's go of his power over them and they waken to new insights and- understandings , transformed by the forgiveness of their victim. - This is the climax of the transformation theme in The Tempest . Vengeance gives way to- forgiveness and mercy and transforms the lives of everyone who is affected by the previous- climate of hatred . This is a deeply Christian idea and we see it throughout Shakespeare's- dramatic works . <p> The above explanation is simplistic , however , and does n't take account of the complexity of- the plays .

Witches , influencing human beings and seducing them into committing evil deeds , feature in Renaissance drama . Audiences were fascinated by them so they made good material for drama . The combination of the Devil 's agents at work and psychological characters struggling against their influence could form the conflict in the drama , and so we had a play like Macbeth . <p> Macbeth is a good example of the treatment of good and evil in both Elizabethan drama and Jacobean drama .

@@34527612 @3527612/ <p> Shakespeare 's depiction of human nature through all his plays reveals the corruption that infects human beings . Corruption appears in many forms in Shakespeare . At its most obvious level , corruption is linked to power and we see countless examples of corruption in the most powerful characters in the plays . Shakespeare often explores the ways in which kings and other powerful figures abuse their position , as well as the ways in which ambitious men plot to gain power , usually the throne , by illegitimate means . <p> As the mediaeval age gave way to the Renaissance the idea persisted that order depends on a close-knit hierarchical society with a legitimate leader at the top , sometimes even ordained by God . Also , the strong humanistic idea persisted that the role of a ruler was to make the welfare of the state and its citizens his priority . To subvert that and make his own self-interest his main priority is to corrupt that ideal . <p> King Richard II ( Richard II ) is an anointed , legitimate monarch who places his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is intelligent and sensitive but is temperamentally unsuited to be a ruler. - Surrounded by parasites and sycophants , he spends vast amounts of money on himself and his friends , and in so doing risks bankrupting the country. - And so he imposes heavy and unreasonable taxes on his subjects . <p> Richard 's cousin , Henry Bolingbroke , takes him to task and is banished . When Richard goes too far and confiscates the property of Bolingbroke 's father , John of Gaunt , Bolingbroke returns to England with an army , to reclaim his father 's property . <p> The play then becomes a drama of the conflict between these two characters , a legitimate but weak king and a subject wronged by him " a subject who , although he denies the desire to be king himself , is far more fitted to be a leader than Richard is . The play is , in a sense , a debate about kingship and what to do about a man who is God 's lieutenant on earth but unfit to be that . Bolingbroke overthrows him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the usurper who is corrupt but God 's anointed who is , and he is deposed to bring an end to his corruption . <p> In Measure for Measure , the Duke of Vienna announces that he is taking a leave of absence and appoints a courtier , Angelo , to deputise for him . Angelo is faced with the task of bringing order to a Vienna that has become morally slack . He has a reputation for purity and probity but what he does n't know is that the Duke is testing him , knowing that he has a dark secret in his past . <p> A young man , Claudio , is in prison , condemned to death for the crime of fornication . His attractive sister , Isabella , about to become a nun , goes to Angelo to plead for her brother 's life .

Angelo is forced to make amends for his betrayal of a woman in his past . This is a fine example of a figure of power putting his own interest before that - of his state and its people . <p> Corruption reveals itself differently in Hamlet . The play is saturated with images of corruption . The rottenness in the state of Denmark is reflected everywhere in images of i 'll health , weeds overwhelming healthy plants , everything decaying and rotting , and poison killing wholesome things .

He is dominating : we see that in the way he instructs Laertes : These few precepts in thy memory/ Look thou character . ' He is not only domineering in his abuse of Ophelia , he is also controlling and dismissive of her as a daughter and a woman . We then see him being meddling and subversive , setting spies on his own son , and finally , fatally corrupt as he schemes and plots for Hamlet 's death . His own death is retribution for that . <p> The centre of corruption in the kingdom and in the play is Claudius .

Claudius ' corrupt actions carry him to the throne and pollute the people around him causing chaos , sorrow and death .

He has also become corrupted . He is unable to act any action he takes will be morally dubious . Not taking revenge will reduce him and make him unfit for rule by his own standards , and taking revenge will do the same . He is trapped in a corrupt circle from which there is no escape .

The next scene may take place in a forest , and there may be trees , and lights representing the sun filtering through leaves .

The playwright " and all the other Elizabethan and Jacobean playwrights " wrote in a way that encouraged the audience to imagine the sets . Sets used in the modern way I have described makes the stage inflexible , whereas the Elizabethan stage was completely flexible . The empty space , that was extended out into the audience and could be viewed from three sides , could be a small prison cell , a battlefield , a royal court , a crowded city street , an ocean , and any other place , in rapid succession , without changing a thing . <p> There were some concessions to realism in Elizabethan plays , though , and we can see how Shakespeare had some practical staging considerations in mind as he wrote his plays .

Falstaff carries the body off the stage . When Hamlet kills Polonius , he drags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place somewhere else , without the dead Polonius lying in the wrong place . Those playwrights always contrived realistic ' ways to remove bodies .

The upper gallery could be a tower , a battlement , a bedroom window , a hilltop or , most famously in Romeo and Juliet , a balcony . But it was just a gallery , always the same : the playwright used language to dress it up as a battlement or a hillside and the audience 's imagination would complete the illusion . <p> It was occasionally necessary to have a piece of furniture in a scene for example , the very important bed on which Othello murders Desdemona .

@@34527618 @3527618/ <p> One thing that puts people off Shakespeare is the effort needed to understand the language - particularly trying to understand the meaning of- all these thees and thous ! In actual fact , at the time Shakespeare was writing the people of England were speaking very much as we speak today . <p> here 's a prose passage from Shakespeare 's Julius Caesar , where Brutus addresses the Romans after the conspirators have killed Caesar : - " As Caesar loved me , I weep for him ; as he was fortunate I rejoice at it ; as he was valiant , I honour him ; but as he was ambitious I slew him . There is tears for his love ; joy for his fortune ; honour for his valour ; and death for his ambition . " <p> Although Shakespeare technically wrote in Early Modern English there 's nothing in that passage that 's not written in a language all modern English speakers would recognise . It 's Modern English as we know it , and immediately accessible to all of usso what is all this about thees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee/thou - and you/your was a firmly established index of social status . That is something of an oversimplified statement , though , because the words were also used to express relationships among family and- neighbor- groups . If you were a person of low social rank , in talking to someone of high rank you would address him/her with the words you and your , whereas he/she would use thee/thou in talking to you . Within the family the parent may address the child as thou , and if the parent assents to it the child may address him/her likewise , so it becomes an expression of affection . Lovers will address each other as thou . It 's similar to the French use of tu instead of the more formal vous . <p> By the middle of the sixteenth century when Shakespeare was writing this system of thee/thou &amp; you/your was breaking down . There 's little trace of it in English today , and although some English dialects in both America and England still use the thee and the thou- - it 's fading fast as communications change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Students who object to Shakespeares use of thee and thou before they have encountered a Shakespeare text will eventually get more out of the play when they understand the use of those words . They will come to see that Shakespeare is using them creatively . <p> Shakespeare 's plays are filled with the interplay of- you- and- thou , with characters expressing mistrust and suspicion , formality , affection , love , a business-like relationship , insults and so on , sometimes those words dancing around each other in a single conversation . <p> For the most part in Shakespeares plays , those of high status will address those they consider to be beneath them as thou , and those of lower status will address their superiors as you . But the use of those words is also an opportunity to create undercurrents and subtleties in the relationships between characters . A character can express his or her sense of importance by addressing someone of the same rank with thee ' , for example , thereby sending a message about that relationship . Not only that , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with thee . That would be an insult of monumental proportions . Two people of equal rank , talking to each other , would use the polite form of you ' but if one started becoming too familiar the other might put him down with the use of thou ' . <p> Some examples of how Shakespeare plays with thee and thou : <p> In Twelfth Night Viola , disguised as a man , goes to woo Olivia on Duke Orsino 's behalf . Olivia questions her , using the more formal address : What is your parentage ? - Viola says that he 's ' a gentleman . Olivia falls in love with the young messenger during that interview and later , going over it in her mind , she thinks of him more intimately with I am a gentleman . I 'll be sworn thou art . <p> In Hamlet , Polonius , telling his son , Laertes , off , mocking him slightly , says that the ship he 's about to embark is about to set sail and is waiting for this important ' passenger - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , embracing him and saying goodbye he says my blessing with thee , expressing his affection . <p> The complexity of the relationship between Beatrice and Benedick in Much Ado about Nothing is largely expressed in the way they address each other with those words . <p> So that 's the guide to thee and thou meanings .

@@34527619 @3527619/ <p> The original classification of Shakespeare 's plays- Comedies ' , Tragedies ' , Histories ' and Roman plays do n't adequately describe all of Shakespeare 's plays , and scholars have come up with more names to do so . The most widely used categories are Romance Plays ' , Problem Plays ' , and Shakespeares Tragicomedy Plays ' . The plays in those categories have much in common , but there are enough differences to prevent some of them to fall into all three . The Winter 's Tale , for example is a play that does have the features of all three , however . <p> A tragicomedy is a play that is neither a comedy nor a tragedy , although it has the features of both . Tragedies are usually focused almost exclusively on the central character , the tragic hero ( although Shakespeare 's tragedies can sometimes be a double tragedy , with two tragic heroes , like Romeo and Juliet ) .

' so the whole area of classification is a very difficult one . It should n't be necessary to classify them but scholars need a language in which to talk about the plays . <p> The Merchant of Venice can be seen as a tragicomedy . It has a comic structure but one of the central characters , Shylock , looks very much like a tragic character .

@@34527628 @3527628/ <p> Almost all of Shakespeare 's plays begin with a state of order or stability , which gives way to disorder or confusion . <p> That disruption could take place in individuals . Macbeth is told that he is going to be king and as a result of that becomes consumed by ambition ; Othello believes his wife to be unfaithful and is overwhelmed by jealousy ; Hamlet learns that his father has been murdered by his father 's brother and becomes obsessed with revenge . Other human causes of disruption are love , hatred , the lust for political power or any other strongly felt emotion . The disruption drives the dramatic action . <p> Disruption could also occur in society for example civil war or rebellion . Sometimes disruption in an individual will lead to social disruption , and vice versa . <p> Disruption in individuals is often echoed by disruption in nature . For example , Lear 's madness is reflected in the storms and tempests that take place throughout ; Macbeth 's unnatural killing of his king is reflected in unnatural happenings such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , earthquakes , unusual downpours etc . <p> Order is restored in the end . The suffering individual is usually dead by the end of the play , but even in the plays that are n't classical tragedies the disrupted individual comes to new understandings and a new outlook on humanity , even though that may be minutes before his or her death . <p> Although order may be restored it is seldom all perfect and harmonious . There are loose ends , such as the treatment of Shylock in The Merchant of Venice . On the surface , it looks like the Christian community has triumphed in the face of an attack from an enemy and restored order to their community . As Shylock slinks away in defeat after he is humiliated in his court case against Antonio though , we are appalled by the nastiness of the Christian characters as they mock him , and we also see the seeds of an even worse disruption of Venetian society as its anti-Semitic character is affirmed . Most of the plays have such hanging threads in their show of order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and new conditions lead to new threats . Shakespeare 's plays reflect that reality . <p> Some of the plays deal specifically with the theme of order and disorder , making it almost what the play is about ' ( although one can never say about a Shakespeare 's play that it 's about ' one particular thing ) . A Midsummer Night 's Dream is one of those . The social order of Athens demands that a father 's will should be enforced . That is also particularly true for the order of the family . Egeus ' family is threatened because his daughter refuses to marry the husband of his choice and insists on her own choice . When she runs away from the ordered , hierarchical society of Athens , followed by her lover and their friends , to the chaos of the woods , order is disrupted : in the woods the relationships are fragmented . There is also a row going on between the rulers of the forest , the Fairy King and Queen , and even the seasons are disrupted . It is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fairy world- is restored that the lovers ' relationships can become ordered once more and their return to human society can in turn restore its order . Egeus ' daughter gets her way regarding her choice of husband , however , and the drama ends with this threat to the social order . <p> Some of the plays begin with a significant measure of disorder , only to see the restoration of order , which then proves to be a mere illusion of order . Macbeth is one such play . It begins with battle raging between the Scots and the Norwegians , aided by Scottish traitors " extreme disorder and chaos everywhere , accompanied by thunder and lightning . Two great military captains , Macbeth and Banquo defeat the Norwegians and restore civil order . A scene in which the king punishes the traitors and rewards the loyal is all about the restoration of social order . Everything now seems ordered and harmonious , but the rest of the play is a demonstration of how disruption within an individual " Macbeth 's over-reaching ambition " can bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restored once again . This play can also be seen as being about ' order and disorder , although we know that it is impossible to say what any Shakespeare play is about . ' One can only explore some of its ideas , but the idea of order and disorder is central in Macbeth . <p> The centrality of the theme is reinforced by the language throughout . Macbeth 's comment , so foul and fair a day I have not seen ' echoes the witches ' chant and links him with the chaos of their dark world . As Macbeth and Lady Macbeth talk they frequently invoke the darkness that allows evil and disorder to flourish " come thick night and pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell ' ; stars hide your fires ' and so on . <p> The contrast between order and disorder is demonstrated in various places throughout the play . The banquet scene is probably the finest illustration of this theme in all of Shakespeare . Macbeth has just become king after murdering Duncan , and is holding a state banquet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seating order . The irony of his welcoming statement , You know your own degrees , sit down ' is striking since he has just disrupted the order by killing his king . This is the scene in which Banquo 's ghost appears . <p> Macbeth 's guilt makes him lose control and the banquet ends in chaos as everyone runs for the door . Lady Macbeth 's urging , stand not on the order of your going but go at once ' confirms the breakdown of order , and it is from this point that the disruption of Scottish society is worked through , to culminate in its restoration with the defeat and death of Macbeth and the restoration of the rightful king , Malcolm , to the throne . <p> Again , with the reminder that no Shakespeare play is about ' any one thing , a central theme of The Tempest is the conflict between order and chaos , with order being a fragile thing , perpetually threatened by chaos .

He has to return to that world and assume his old life there a life that was disrupted by political ambition " with all its threats . <p> Every one of Shakespeare 's plays can be examined from the perspective of the conflict between order and disorder , whatever its other , and sometimes more dominant , themes are .

During which siege the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of Sextus Tarquinius , the kings son , in their discourses after supper every one commended the virtues of his own wife ; among whom Collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife Lucretia . In that pleasant humour they all posted to Rome ; and intending , by their secret and sudden arrival , to make trial of that which every one had before avouched , only Collatinus finds his wife , though it were late in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies were all found dancing and revelling , or in several disports . Whereupon the noblemen yielded Collatinus the victory , and his wife the fame . At that time Sextus Tarquinius being inflamed with Lucrece beauty , yet smothering his passions for the present , departed with the rest back to the camp ; from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself , and was , according to his estate , royally entertained and lodged by Lucrece at Collatium . The same night he treacherously stealeth into her chamber , violently ravished her , and early in the morning speedeth away . Lucrece , in this lamentable plight , hastily dispatcheth messengers , one to Rome for her father , another to the camp for Collatine . They came , the one accompanied with Junius Brutus , the other with Publius Valerius ; and finding Lucrece attired in mourning habit , demanded the cause of her sorrow . She , first taking an oath of them for her revenge , revealed the actor and whole manner of his dealing , and withal suddenly stabbed herself . Which done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole hated family of the Tarquins ; and bearing the dead body to Rome , Brutus acquainted the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed , with a bitter invective against the tyranny of the king : wherewith the people were so moved , that with one consent and a general acclamation the Tarquins were all exiled , and the state government changed from kings to consuls. - <h> The Poem : The Rape of Lucrece , by William Shakespeare <p> From the besieged Ardea all in post , Borne by the trustless wings of false desire , Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host , And to Collatium bears the lightless fire Which , in pale embers hid , lurks to aspire And girdle with embracing flames the waist Of Collatines fair love , Lucrece the chaste . <p> Haply that name of chaste unhapply set This bateless edge on his keen appetite ; When Collatine unwisely did not let To praise the clear unmatched red and white Which triumphed in that sky of his delight , Where mortal stars , as bright as heavens beauties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he the night before , in Tarquins tent , Unlocked the treasure of his happy state ; What priceless wealth the heavens had him lent In the possession of his beauteous mate ; Reckning his fortune at such high-proud rate That kings might be espoused to more fame , But king nor peer to such a peerless dame . <p> O happiness enjoyed but of a few ! And , if possessed , as soon decayed and done As is the morning silver-melting dew Against the golden splendour of the sun ! An expired date , cancelled ere well begun : Honour and beauty , in the owners arms , Are weakly fortressed from a world of harms . <p> Beauty itself doth of itself persuade The eyes of men without an orator ; What needeth then apology be made , To set forth that which is so singular ? Or why is Collatine the publisher Of that rich jewel he should keep unknown From thievish ears , because it is his own ? <p> Perchance his boast of Lucrece sovreignty Suggested this proud issue of a king ; For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that envy of so rich a thing , Braving compare , disdainfully did sting His high-pitched thoughts , that meaner men should vaunt That golden hap which their superiors want . <p> But some untimely thought did instigate His all too timeless speed , if none of those .

O rash-false heat , wrapped in repentant cold , Thy hasty spring still blasts , and neer grows old ! <p> When at Collatium this false lord arrived , Well was he welcomed by the Roman dame , Within whose face beauty and virtue strived Which of them both should underprop her fame : When virtue bragged , beauty would blush for shame ; When beauty boasted blushes , in despite Virtue would stain that oer with silver white . <p> But beauty , in that white entituled , From Venus doves doth challenge that fair field ; Then virtue claims from beauty beautys red , Which virtue gave the golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then their shield ; Teaching them thus to use it in the fight , When shame assailed , the red should fence the white . <p> This heraldry in Lucrece face was seen , Argued by beautys red and virtues white ; Of eithers colour was the other queen , Proving from worlds minority their right ; Yet their ambition makes them still to fight , The sovereignty of either being so great That oft they interchange each others seat . <p> This silent war of lilies and of roses Which Tarquin viewed in her fair faces field , In their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses ; Where , lest between them both it should be killed , The coward captive vanquished doth yield To those two armies that would let him go Rather than triumph in so false a foe . <p> Now thinks he that her husbands shallow tongue , The niggard prodigal that praised her so , In that high task hath done her beauty wrong , Which far exceeds his barren skill to show ; Therefore that praise which Collatine doth owe Enchanted Tarquin answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For that he coloured with his high estate , Hiding base sin in pleats of majesty ; That nothing in him seemed inordinate , Save sometime too much wonder of his eye , Which , having all , all could not satisfy ; But , poorly rich , so wanteth in his store That cloyed with much he pineth still for more . <p> But she , that never coped with stranger eyes , Could pick no meaning from their parling looks , Nor read the subtle-shining secrecies Writ in the glassy margents of such books . She touched no unknown baits , nor feared no hooks ; Nor could she moralize his wanton sight , More than his eyes were opened to the light . <p> He stories to her ears her husbands fame , Won in the fields of fruitful Italy ; And decks with praises Collatines high name , Made glorious by his manly chivalry With bruised arms and wreaths of victory .

No cloudy show of stormy blustring weather Doth yet in his fair welkin once appear ; Till sable Night , mother of dread and fear , Upon the world dim darkness doth display , And in her vaulty prison stows the day . <p> For then is Tarquin brought unto his bed , Intending weariness with heavy sprite ; For after supper long he questioned With modest Lucrece , and wore out the night . Now leaden slumber with lifes strength doth fight ; And every one to rest himself betakes , Save thieves and cares and troubled minds that wakes . <p> As one of which doth Tarquin lie revolving The sundry dangers of his wills obtaining ; Yet ever to obtain his will resolving , Though weak-built hopes persuade him to abstaining ; Despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining , And when great treasure is the meed proposed , Though death be adjunct , there 's no death supposed . <p> Those that much covet are with gain so fond That what they have not , that which they possess , They scatter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping more , they have but less ; Or , gaining more , the profit of excess Is but to surfeit , and such griefs sustain That they prove bankrupt in this poor-rich gain . <p> The aim of all is but to nurse the life With honour , wealth and ease , in waning age ; And in this aim there is such thwarting strife That one for all or all for one we gage : As life for honour in fell battles rage ; Honour for wealth ; and oft that wealth doth cost The death of all , and all together lost . <p> So that in ventring ill we leave to be The things we are for that which we expect ; And this ambitious foul infirmity , In having much , torments us with defect Of that we have ; so then we do neglect The thing we have , and , all for want of wit , Make something nothing by augmenting it . <p> Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make , Pawning his honour to obtain his lust ; And for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there be no self-trust ?

Pure thoughts are dead and still , While lust and murder wakes to stain and kill . <p> His falchion on a flint he softly smiteth , That from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly , Whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth , Which must be lode-star to his lustful eye ; And to the flame thus speaks advisedly : As from this cold flint I enforced this fire , So Lucrece must I force to my desire. <p> Here pale with fear he doth premeditate The dangers of his loathsome enterprise , And in his inward mind he doth debate What following sorrow may on this arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked armour of still-slaughtered lust , And justly thus controls his thoughts unjust : <p> Fair torch , burn out thy light , and lend it not To darken her whose light excelleth thine ; And die , unhallowed thoughts , before you blot With your uncleanness that which is divine ; Offer pure incense to so pure a shrine ; Let fair humanity abhor the deed That spots and stains loves modest snow-white weed . <p> O shame to knighthood and to shining arms !

Which struck her sad , and then it faster rocked Until her husbands welfare she did hear ; Whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer That had Narcissus seen her as she stood Self-love had never drowned him in the flood . <p> Why hunt I then for colour or excuses ? All orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth ; Poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses ; Love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth ; Affection is my captain , and he leadeth ; And when his gaudy banner is displayed , The coward fights and will not be dismayed . <p> As corn oergrown by weeds , so heedful fear Is almost choked by unresisted lust . Away he steals with open listning car , Full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust ; Both which , as servitors to the unjust , So cross him with their opposite persuasion That now he vows a league and now invasion . <p> Within his thought her heavenly image sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye which looks on her confounds his wits ; That eye which him beholds , as more divine , Unto a view so false will not incline ; But with a pure appeal seeks to the heart , Which once corrupted takes the worser part ; <p> And therein heartens up his servile powers , Who , flattred by their leaders jocund show , Stuff up his lust , as minutes fill up hours ; And as their captain , so their pride doth grow , Paying more slavish tribute than they owe . By reprobate desire thus madly led , The Roman lord marcheth to Lucrece bed . <p> The locks between her chamber and his will , Each one by him enforced , retires his ward ; But , as they open , they all rate his i 'll , Which drives the creeping thief to some regard .

Return again in haste ; Thou seest our mistress ornaments are chaste. <p> But all these poor forbiddings could not stay him ; He in the worst sense consters their denial : The doors , the wind , the glove , that did delay him , He takes for accidental things of trial ; Or as those bars which stop the hourly dial , Who with a lingring stay his course doth let , Till every minute pays the hour his debt . <p> So , so , quoth he , these let 's attend the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , To add a more rejoicing to the prime , And give the sneaped birds more cause to sing . Pain pays the income of each precious thing ; Huge rocks ; high winds , strong pirates , shelves and sands The merchant fears , ere rich at home he lands. <p> Now is he come unto the chamber door That shuts him from the heaven of his thought , Which with a yielding latch , and with no more , Hath barred him from the blessed thing he sought . So from himself impiety hath wrought , That for his prey to pray he doth begin , As if the heavens should countenance his sin . <p> But in the midst of his unfruitful prayer , Having solicited th eternal power That his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair , And they would stand auspicious to the hour , Even there he starts ; quoth he I must deflower : The powers to whom I pray abhor this fact ; How can they then assist me in the act ? <p> Then Love and Fortune be my gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thoughts are but dreams.till their effects be tried ; The blackest sin is cleared with absolution ; Against loves fire fears frost hath dissolution . The eye of heaven is out , and misty night Covers the shame that follows sweet delight. <p> This said , his guilty hand plucked up the latch , And with his knee the door he opens wide . The dove sleeps fast that this night-owl will catch . Thus treason works ere traitors be espied . Who sees the lurking serpent steps aside ; But she , sound sleeping , fearing no such thing , Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting . <p> Into the chamber wickedly he stalks And gazeth on her yet unstained bed . The curtains being close , about he walks , Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head . By their high treason is his heart misled , Which gives the watch-word to his hand full soon To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon . <p> Look as the fair and fiery-pointed sun , Rushing from forth a cloud , bereaves our sight ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To wink , being blinded with a greater light ; Whether it is that she reflects so bright That dazzleth them , or else some shame supposed , But blind they are , and keep themselves enclosed . <p> O , had they in that darksome prison died !

These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred , Who like a foul usurper went about From this fair throne to heave the owner out . <p> What could he see but mightily he noted ?

Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words ; Sometime t is mad and too much talk affords . <p> The little birds that tune their mornings joy Make her moans mad with their sweet melody ; " For mirth doth search the bottom of annoy ; " Sad souls are slain in merry company ; " Grief best is pleased with griefs society True sorrow then is feelingly sufficed When with like semblance it is sympathized . <p> " T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He ten times pines that pines beholding food ; " To see the salve doth make the wound ache more ; " Great grief grieves most at that would do it good ; " Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood , Who , being stopped , the bounding banks oerflows ; Grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows . <p> Come , Philomel , that singst of ravishment , Make thy sad grove in my dishevelled hair .

Poor Lucrece cheeks unto her maid seem so As winter meads when sun doth melt their snow . <p> Her mistress she doth give demure good-morrow With soft slow tongue , true mark of modesty , And sorts a sad look to her ladys sorrow , For why her face wore sorrows livery , But durst not ask of her audaciously Why her two suns were cloud-eclipsed so , Nor why her fair cheeks over-washed with woe . <p> But as the earth doth weep , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , Even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet Her circled eyne , enforced by sympathy Of those fair suns set in her mistress sky , Who in a salt-waved ocean quench their light , Which makes the maid weep like the dewy night . <p> A pretty while these pretty creatures stand , Like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling . One justly weeps ; the other takes in hand No cause but company of her drops spilling : Their gentle sex to weep are often willing , Grieving themselves to guess at others smarts , And then they drown their eyes or break their hearts . <p> For men have marble , women waxen , minds , And therefore are they formed as marble will ; The weak oppressed , th impression of strange kinds Is formed in them by force , by fraud , or skill .

Conceit and grief an eager combat fight ; What wit sets down is blotted straight with will ; This is too curious-good , this blunt and i 'll : Much like a press of people at a door , Throng her inventions , which shall go before . <p> At last she thus begins : Thou worthy lord Of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee , Health to thy person ! next vouchsafe tafford- If ever , love , thy Lucrece thou wilt see- Some present speed to come and visit me . So I commend me , from our house in grief ; My woes are tedious , though my words are brief. <p> Here folds she up the tenor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this short schedule Collatine may know Her grief , but not her griefs true quality ; She dares not thereof make discovery , Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse , Ere she with blood had stained her stained excuse . <p> Besides , the life and feeling of her passion She hoards , to spend when he is by to hear her , When sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion Of her disgrace , the better so to clear her From that suspicion which the world might bear her . To shun this blot , she would not blot the letter With words , till action might become them better . <p> To see sad sights moves more than hear them told ; For then the eye interprets to the car The heavy motion that it doth behold , When every part a part of woe doth bear . T is but a part of sorrow that we hear : Deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords , And sorrow ebbs , being blown with wind of words . <p> Her letter now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord with more than haste. The post attends , and she delivers it , Charging the sour-faced groom to hie as fast As lagging fowls before the northern blast . Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems : Extremity still urgeth such extremes . <p> The homely villain curtsies to her low , And blushing on her , with a steadfast eye Receives the scroll without or yea or no , And forth with bashful innocence doth hie . But they whose guilt within their bosoms lie Imagine every eye beholds their blame ; For Lucrece thought he blushed to see her shame : <p> When , silly groom , God wot , it was defect Of spirit , life and bold audacity . Such harmless creatures have a true respect To talk in deeds , while others saucily Promise more speed but do it leisurely . Even so this pattern of the worn-out age Pawned honest looks , but laid no words to gage . <p> His kindled duty kindled her mistrust , That two red fires in both their faces blazed ; She thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , wistly on him gazed ; Her earnest eye did make him more amazed ; The more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish , The more she thought he spied in her some blemish . <p> But long she thinks till he return again , And yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone . The weary time she can not entertain , For now t is stale to sigh , to weep and groan ; So woe hath wearied woe , moan tired moan , That she her plaints a little while doth stay , Pausing for means to mourn some newer way . <p> At last she calls to mind where hangs a piece Of skilful painting , made for Priams Troy , Before the which is drawn the power of Greece , For Helens rape the city to destroy , Threatning cloud-kissing Ilion with annoy ; Which the conceited painter drew so proud As heaven , it seemed , to kiss the turrets bowed . <p> A thousand lamentable objects there , In scorn of nature , art gave lifeless life : Many a dry drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the wife ; The red blood reeked , to show the painters strife ; And dying eyes gleamed forth their ashy lights , Like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights . <p> There might you see the labouring pioneer Begrimed with sweat and smeared all with dust ; And from the towers of Troy there would appear The very eyes of men through loop-holes thrust , Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust . Such sweet observance in this work was had That one might see those far-off eyes look sad . <p> In great commanders grace and majesty You might behold , triumphing in their faces ; In youth , quick bearing and dexterity ; And here and there the painter interlaces Pale cowards marching on with trembling paces , Which heartless peasants did so well resemble That one would swear he saw them quake and tremble . <p> There pleading might you see grave Nestor stand , As t were encouraging the Greeks to fight , Making such sober action with his hand That it beguiled attention , charmed the sight . In speech , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , and from his lips did fly Thin winding breath which purled up to the sky . <p> About him were a press of gaping fades , Which seemed to swallow up his sound advice , All jointly listning , but with several graces , As if some mermaid did their ears entice , Some high , some low , the painter was so nice ; The scalps of many , almost hid behind , To jump up higher seemed , to mock the mind . <p> Here one mans hand leaned on anothers head , His nose being shadowed by his neighbours ear ; Here one being thronged bears back , all bolln and red ; Another smothered seems to pelt and swear ; And in their rage such signs , of rage of rage they bear As , but for loss of Nestors golden words , It seemed they would debate with angry swords . <p> For much imaginary work was there ; Conceit deceitful , so compact , so kind , That for Achilles image stood his spear Griped in an armed hand ; himself behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A hand , a foot , a face , a leg , a head , Stood for the whole to be imagined . <p> And from the walls of strong-besieged Troy When their brave hope , bold Hector , marched to field , Stood many Trojan mothers sharing joy To see their youthful sons bright weapons wield ; And to their hope they such odd action yield That through their light joy seemed to appear , Like bright things stained , a kind of heavy fear . <p> And from the strand of Dardan where they fought To Simois reedy banks the red blood ran , Whose waves to imitate the battle sought With swelling ridges ; and their ranks began To break upon the galled shore , and than Retire again , till meeting greater ranks They join and shoot their foam at Simois banks . <p> To this well-painted piece is Lucrece come , To find a face where all distress is stelled . Many she sees where cares have carved some , But none where all distress and dolour dwelled , Till she despairing Hecuba beheld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which bleeding under Pyrrhus proud foot lies . <p> In her the painter had anatomized Times ruin , beautys wrack , and grim cares reign ; Her cheeks with chaps and wrinkles were disguised ; Of what she was no semblance did remain ; Her blue blood changed to black in every vein , Wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed , Showed life imprisoned in a body dead . <p> On this sad shadow Lucrece spends her eyes , And shapes her sorrow to the beldams woes , Who nothing wants to answer her but cries , And bitter words to ban her cruel foes : The painter was no god to lend her those ; And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong , To give her so much grief and not a tongue . <p> Show me the strumpet that began this stir , That with my nails her beauty I may tear . Thy heat of lust , fond Paris , did incur This load of wrath that burning Troy doth bear . Thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here ; And here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sire , the son , the dame and daughter die . <p> Why should the private pleasure of some one Become the public plague of many moe ? Let sin , alone committed , light alone Upon his head that hath transgressed so ; Let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe . For ones-offence why should so many fall , To plague a private sin in general ? <p> Here feelingly she weeps Troys painted woes ; For sorrow , like a heavy-hanging bell Once set on ringing , with his own weight goes ; Then little strength rings out the dolefull knell ; So Lucrece , set a-work , sad tales doth tell To pencilled pensiveness and coloured sorrow ; She lends them words , and she their looks doth borrow . <p> She throws her eyes about the painting round , And who she finds forlorn she doth lament . At last she sees a wretched image bound That piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent ; His face , . though full of cares , yet showed content ; Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woes . <p> In him the painter laboured with his skill To hide deceit and give the harmless show An humble gait , calm looks , eyes wailing still , A brow unbent that seemed to welcome woe ; Cheeks neither red nor pale , but mingled so That blushing red no guilty instance gave , Nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have . <p> But , like a constant and confirmed devil , He entertained a show so seeming just , And therein so ensconced his secret evil , That jealousy itself could not mistrust False creeping craft and perjury should thrust Into so bright a day such black-faced storms , Or blot with hell-born sin such saint-like forms . <p> The well-skilled workman this mild image drew For perjured Sinon , whose enchanting story The credulous old Priam after slew ; Whose words , like wildfire , burnt the shining glory Of rich-built Ilion , that the skies were sorry , And little stars shot from their fixed places , When their glass fell wherein they viewed their faces . <p> This picture she advisedly perused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saying , some shape in Sinons was abused ; So fair a form lodged not a mind so i 'll ; And still on him she gazed , and gazing still Such signs of truth in his plain face she spied That she concludes the picture was belied . <p> It can not be , quoth she , that so much guile- She would have said can lurk in such a look ; But Tarquins shape came in her mind the while , And from her tongue can lurk from can not took ; It can not be she in that sense forsook , And turned it thus , It can not be , I find , But such a face should bear a wicked mind ; <p> For even as subtle Sinon here is painted , So sober-sad , so weary and so mild , As if with grief or travail he had fainted , To me came Tarquin armed to beguild With outward honesty , but yet defiled With inward vice . As Priam him did cherish , So did I Tarquin ; so my Troy did perish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , To see those borrowed tears that Sinon sheds . Priam , why art thou old and yet not wise ? For every tear he falls a Trojan bleeds ; His eye drops fire , no water thence proceeds ; Those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity Are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city . <p> Such devils steal effects from lightless hell ; For Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold , And in that cold hot-burning fire doth dwell ; These contraries such unity do hold Only to flatter fools and make them bold ; So Priams trust false Sinons tears doth flatter That he finds means to burn his Troy with water. <p> Here , all enraged , such passion her assails , That patience is quite beaten from her breast . She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails , Comparing him to that unhappy guest Whose deed hath made herself herself At last she smilingly with this gives oer : Fool , fool ! quoth she , his wounds will not be sore. <p> Thus ebbs and flows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time with her complaining . She looks for night , and then she longs for morrow , And both she thinks too long with her remaining . Short time seems long in sorrows sharp sustaining ; Though woe be heavy , yet it seldom sleeps , And they that watch see time how slow it creeps . <p> Which all this time hath overslipped her thought That she with painted images hath spent , Being from the feeling of her own grief brought By deep surmise of others detriment , Losing her woes in shows of discontent . It easeth some , though none it ever cured , To think their dolour others have endured . <p> But now the mindful messenger come back Brings home his lord and other company ; Who finds his Lucrece clad in mourning black , And round about her tear-distained eye Blue circles streamed , like rainbows in the sky . These water-galls in her dim element Foretell new storms to those already spent . <p> Which when her sad-beholding husband saw , Amazedly in her sad face he stares : Her eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her lively colour killed with deadly cares . He hath no power to ask her how she fares ; Both stood , like old acquaintance in a trance , Met far from home , wondring each others chance . <p> Three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire Ere once she can discharge one word of woe ; At length addressed to answer his desire , She modestly prepares to let them know Her honour is taen prisoner by the foe ; While Collatine and his consorted lords With sad attention long to hear her words . <p> And now this pale swan in her watry nest Begins the sad dirge of her certain ending . Few words , quoth she , shall fit the trespass best , Where no excuse can give the fault amending : In me moe woes than words are now depending ; And my laments would be drawn out too long , To tell them all with one poor tired tongue . <p> Then be this all the task it hath to say : Dear husband , in the interest of thy bed A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wast wo n't to rest thy weary head ; And what wrong else may be imagined By foul enforcement might be done to me , From that , alas , thy Lucrece is not free . <p> " For some hard-favoured groom of thine , " quoth he , " Unless thou yoke thy liking to my will , I 'll murder straight , and then I 'll slaughter thee , And swear I found you where you did fulfill The loathsome act of lust , and so did kill The lechers in their deed : this act will be My fame , and thy perpetual infamy . " <p> With this , I did begin to start and cry , And then against my heart he set his sword , Swearing , unless I took all patiently , I should not live to speak another word ; So should my shame still rest upon record , And never be forgot in mighty Rome Th adulterate death of Lucrece and her groom . <p> O , teach me how to make mine own excuse ! Or , at the least , this refuge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this abuse , Immaculate and spotless is my mind ; That was not forced ; that never was inclined To accessary yieldings , but still pure Doth in her poisoned closet yet endure. <p> Lo , here , the hopeless merchant of this loss , With head declined , and voice damned up with woe , With sad-set eyes and wreathed arms across , From lips new waxen pale begins to blow The grief away that stops his answer so ; But , wretched as he is , he strives in vain ; What he breathes out his breath drinks up again . <p> As through an arch the violent roaring tide Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste , Yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride Back to the strait that forced him on so fast , In rage sent out , recalled in rage , being past ; Even so his sighs , his sorrows , make a saw , To push grief on and back the same grief draw . <p> And for my sake , when I might charm thee so , For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be suddenly revenged on my foe , Thine , mine , his own ; suppose thou dost defend me From what is past . The help that thou shalt lend me Comes all too late , yet let the traitor die ; " For sparing justice feeds iniquity . <p> But ere I name him , you fair lords , quoth she , Speaking to those that came with Collatine , Shall plight your honourable faiths to me , With swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine ; For t is a meritorious fair design To chase injustice with revengeful arms : Knights , by their oaths , should right poor ladies harms. <p> At this request , with noble disposition Each present lord began to promise aid , As bound in knighthood to her imposition , Longing to hear the hateful foe bewrayed . But she , that yet her sad task hath not said , The protestation stops .

No , no , quoth she , no dame hereafter living By my excuse shall claim excuses giving. <p> Here with a sigh , as if her heart would break , She throws forth Tarquins name : He , he , she says , But more than he her poor tongue could not speak ; Till after many accents and delays , Untimely breathings , sick and short assays , She utters this : He , he , fair lords , t is he , That guides this hand to give this wound to me. <p> Even here , she sheathed in her harmless breast A harmful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did bail it from the deep unrest Of that polluted prison where it breathed . Her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeathed Her winged sprite and through her wounds doth fly Lifes lasting date from cancelled destiny . <p> Stone-still , astonished with this deadly deed , Stood Collatine and all his lordly crew ; Till Lucrece father , that beholds her bleed , Himself on her self-slaughtred body threw ; And from the purple fountain Brutus drew The murdrous knife , and , as it left the place , Her blood , in poor revenge , held it in chase ; <p> And bubbling from her breast , it doth divide In two slow rivers , that the crimson blood Circles her body in on every side , Who like a late-sacked island vastly stood Bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood . Some of her blood still pure and red remained , And some looked black , and that false Tarquin stained . <p> About the mourning and congealed face Of that black blood a watry rigol goes , Which seems to weep upon the tainted place ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood some watery token shows ; And blood untainted still doth red abide , Blushing at that which is so putrified . <p> Daughter , dear daughter , old Lucretius cries , That life was mine which thou hast here deprived . If in the child the fathers image lies , Where shall I live now Lucrece is unlived ? Thou wast not to this end from me derived . If children predecease progenitors , We are their offspring , and they none of ours . <p> Poor broken glass , I often did behold In thy sweet semblance my old age new born ; But now that fair fresh mirror , dim and old , Shows me a bare-boned death by time outworn ; O , from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn , And shivered all the beauty of my glass , That I no more can see what once I was . <p> O time , cease thou thy course and last no longer , If they surcease to be that should survive . Shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger , And leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young possess their hive . Then live , sweet Lucrece , live again , and see Thy father die , and not thy father thee. <p> By this , starts Collatine as from a dream , And bids Lucretius give his sorrow place ; And then in key-cold Lucrece bleeding stream He falls , and bathes the pale fear in his face , And counterfeits to die with her a space ; Till manly shame bids him possess his breath , And live to be revenged on her death . <p> The deep vexation of his inward soul Hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue ; Who , mad that sorrow should his use control Or keep him from heart-easing words so long , Begins to talk ; but through his lips do throng Weak words , so thick come in his poor hearts aid That no man could distinguish what he said . <p> Yet sometime Tarquin was pronounced plain , But through his teeth , as if the name he tore .

O , mine she is , Replies her husband : do not take away My sorrows interest ; let no mourner say He weeps for her , for she was only mine , And only must be wailed by Collatine. <p> Brutus , who plucked the knife from Lucrece side , Seeing such emulation in their woe , Began to clothe his wit in state and pride , Burying in Lucrece wound his follys show . He with the Romans was esteemed so As silly jeering idiots are with kings , For sportive words and uttring foolish things . <p> Why , Collatine , is woe the cure for woe ? Do wounds help wounds , or grief help grievous deeds ? Is it revenge to give thyself a blow For his foul act by whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds proceeds . Thy wretched wife mistook the matter so To slay herself , that should have slain her foe . <p> Courageous Roman , do not steep thy heart In such relenting dew of lamentations , But kneel with me and help to bear thy part To rouse our Roman gods with invocations That they will suffer these abominations , Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced , By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased . <p> Now by the Capitol that we adore , And by this chaste blood so unjustly stained , By heavens fair sun that breeds the fat earths store , By all our country rights in Rome maintained , And by chaste Lucrece soul that late complained Her wrongs to us , and by this bloody knife , We will revenge the death of this true wife. <p> This said , he struck his hand upon his breast , And kissed the fatal knife to end his vow , And to his protestation urged the rest , Who , wondring at him , did his words allow ; Then jointly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep vow which Brutus made before He doth again repeat , and that they swore . <p> When they had sworn to this advised doom , They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence , To show her bleeding body thorough Rome , And so to publish Tarquins foul offence ; Which being done with speedy diligence , The Romans plausible did give consent To Tarquins everlasting banishment . 
@@34527633 @3527633/ <p> One of the main features of Renaissance art is that it was inspired by classical art and philosophy . This is evident in the work of such- artists- as Michelangelo who , caught up in the spirit of Humanism that was sweeping across Europe , focused on the human form . Focusing on the human form during Mediaeval times would have been impossible as it would have been a distraction from the necessary focus on God . <p> The essence of Humanistic art was that human beings were created in Gods image so it was possible for Michelangelo even to portray God as a beautiful and physically powerful man with realistic human features , presented as perfection in fact , the human form at its most beautiful. - Artists- became anatomists , going as far as buying human bodies for dissection . The result was a new realism in the representation of human beings in art . <p> Shakespeare- is , in a way , the Michelangelo of literature . That he could , in one play , Othello , written four hundred years ago , represent what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcoholic , in Iago and Cassio respectively , is incredible . Iago is a fully realised physochological character just as the David is a fully realized man physically . <p> Greek drama was an important model for Renaissance drama after the flat , unrealistic morality plays of the mediaval- centuries . The Greek philosopher , Aristotle , defined tragedy and asserted that it was the noblest and most serious , dignified and important form of drama . Many of the plays of- the Renaissance- resembled those Greek tragedies . In several of- Shakespeares plays there is a central protagonist who undergoes a harrowing experience as he is brought down from his lofty height , ending up dead . There is also a special feeling created in an observer of those- Shakespearedramas , similar to the feeling described by Aristotle as the effect of tragedy on an observer . Critics thus thought of those- Shakespeare- plays as tragedies and that notion has remained with us to this day , although many of those interested inShakespeare- are now thinking differently about the plays . There are still teachers , though , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss a great deal of what those plays are doing . <p> In his Poetics Aristotle outlines tragedy as follows : The protagonist is someone of high estate ; a prince or a king . He is like us perhaps a bit different in his level of nobility so that we can both identify with him and admire him as a man as well as respect him for his high estate . The protagonist has a tragic flaw in his character which makes him contribute to his own destruction . This can take the form of an obsession . The flaw is often part of his greatness but it also causes his downfall . The flaw causes the protagonist to make mistakes and misjudgments . That in turn begins to alienate him from his supporters so that he becomes isolated . He begins to fall from his high level . He struggles to regain his position but fails and he comes crashing down . He eventually recognises his mistakes , but too late . An important aspect is the suffering he undergoes , which the audience observes and identifies with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to us an avoidable suffering . At thend the air is cleared by the restoration of the order that existed before the events of the story and we experience what Aristotle calls catharsis a feeling of relief and closure . <p> Using the term tragedy about- Shakespeares plays invites attempts to fit them to the Aristotelian pattern but none of them fits . Othello seems to conform to the pattern but when one thinks about it , Othello , superficially resembling a tragic hero , does n't  even seem to be the main character in the play . It can be seen as a modern psychological drama about a psychopath who manipulates everyone around him just for fun just because he has nothing better to do and destroying other human beings gives him pleasure or is necessary because they get in his way . Othello may seem to have a fatal flaw too trusting , gullible but so do all the other characters , because Iago has deceived them all with his psychopathic charm and a deliberate effort of making himself appear trustworthy . Every misjudgment Othello makes is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Does he have all those tragic flaws as well ? The feeling at the end is not quite Aristotle either . Perhaps it is more of a disgust for Iago than pity for Othello , who comes across as more stupid than tragic . And to make things more complicated , our feeling of pity is directed more to Desdamona . And yet some teachers miss the meaning of this play by their insistence on teaching it as an Aristotelian tragedy . <p> Antony and Cleopatra is sometimes called a double tragedy . While Othello appears to fit the Aristotelian pattern because of the huge charisma of Othello at the beginning of the play Antony and Cleopatra can not fit it in any shape or form . In tragedy the focus is on the mind and inner struggle of the protagonist . The emotional information comes to the audience from that source . In comedy the information comes from a variety of sources and the comic effect is produced by a- display- of many different points of view , coming at the audience from different angles . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have something very different from a Greek tragedy . What we have is a miracle a tragic feeling coming out of a comic structure . <p> So what is Shakespearean tragedy ? Perhaps there is no such thing . And yet we can identify a tragic feeling and even a cathartic effect in some of the plays . We must be very careful not to insist on fitting them to any pattern because that would n't help us understand the plays . We must look elsewhere for our understanding of them . Moreover , all of- Shakespeares plays have elements of both tragedy and comedy , sometimes very finely balanced , creating effects that Aristotle could never have dreamt of .

@@34527645 @3527645/ <p> This article picks out Shakespeares most powerful female characters across all of his plays . Social and political power was entirely in the hands of the men in Elizabethan England and particularly , well-born men . Both women and men in the lower classes were powerless but women in the upper classes were in a particularly unenviable position as their value was generally reckoned to be a rich or powerful man 's path to more riches or more power : daughters were considered to be possessions and- were passed from father to husband to forge alliances between the rich and powerful . The father had the sole right to make the decision about his daughter 's marriage . Once she was married her function was to produce an heir , and daughters who could be used for the family 's further advancement . <p> One can not therefore talk about Shakespeares powerful women in the social or political sense , but there are a number- very powerful women in Shakespeare , in the personal sense .

At the end of the plays where he does that , however , the women always revert to their female role and the conclusion is marriage and declarations of their subservience to men and their reversion to the conventional female role . Perhaps even Shakespeare failed to imagine the model of equality that is so familiar to us and which we take for granted . <p> Nevertheless , all the men in those cultures are surrounded by women , some ineffectual but many very strong . Every male has either a grandmother or a mother , a sister , or a daughter who he knows to be strong , even though she may be wearing clothes that signify her submissive condition , such as head and face covers , whole body coverings etc . <p> One of the most interesting things in Shakespeare is his presentation of strong women .

Enraged , he banishes her and tells her two suitors , both princes , that whoever wants her can have her but without the dowry they had been expecting . The Duke of Burgundy declines but The King of France agrees to take her for herself . She has stood up to her father , showing great courage . Later , when the other two have cruelly rejected Lear and he lies , defeated and imprisoned in a dungeon , she is with him , also imprisoned she comforts him and raises him up . She has helped him to learn what the bond between a father and daughter is . She has shown great strength throughout , and when her sisters have her hanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unusual in that , since her father 's death , having no brother , she has had to perform the role of a man and manage the very wealthy estate he has left her . Nevertheless , he has been able to exercise power over her from beyond the grave by stipulating in his will that those wealthy and powerful men who come to woo her from around the world will have to undergo a test and choose from three caskets , one of which contains the permission to marry Portia . When a judge is required by the Duke of Venice to try the case Shylock has brought against Antonio , who is reluctant to yield the pound of flesh he has agreed to give Shylock if he is unable to pay a loan in time . Portia comes disguised as a famous young judge and shows extraordinary qualities in delivering her judgment .

Their marriage falls apart and they become estranged . She suffers terrible nightmares and finally commits suicide . <p> Much Ado about Nothing is a remarkable play in which Shakespeare intertwines an ancient mythological story with an ultra-modern love story invented by himself . Beatrice is a feisty , independent woman , seen by all those around her as such .

But they are tricked by their friends into falling in love . Beatrice draws Benedick into a plot to get revenge on Claudio , who has betrayed her cousin , Hero , who was about to marry him . The play ends with the couple confirmed in their love and their decision to marry . Beatrice reverts to the traditional female role but in her case there is a decided edge to it . <p> Juliet would not be thought of as a woman in our time but at just fourteen she is already a commodity which her father , a rich merchant , is preparing to trade for a connection with a noble family .

He swears at her , threatens her and even strikes her . She does not give way , and desperate for a way out without giving up her love for Romeo , she seeks the advice of Friar Lawrence . His solution is to take a drug that will make her appear dead . She will be placed in a tomb and Romeo will come and take her away .

The Duke asks her to give an account of herself and in a remarkable speech she convinces him . In that speech she comes across as a modern woman " an independent woman who has been a good daughter but is now ready to ally herself with her husband . If her father does n't like that then it 's just too bad . It is n't his business anymore .

As a man she has the freedom to move around without a chaperone . Her ability to adapt herself to her circumstances in spite of her female upbringing where she has been protected by men and all decisions about her have been made by men , is an indication of her strength . It is not only that adaptation that suggests strength but the ability to manipulate her circumstances for her own desired outcome , which is to marry the Duke . <p> Margaret of Anjou is a character in four of Shakespeares plays : Henry VI pts. 1 , 2 , 3 and Richard III . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry VI of England .

One particular shipwreck that of The Sea-Adventure was written about again and again . Part of a fleet of ships carrying colonists to Virginia disappeared but the crew and passengers survived . They had been presumed drowned but had just been blown hundreds of miles off course . The reappearance of the survivors was considered something of a miracle . Shakespeare had obviously read the reports and let his imagination run wild on it . His ship in the play is wrecked near a Mediterranean island . Shakespeare makes it a magical island controlled by Prospero previously a European duke who brings those who have wronged him to the island .

@@34527655 @3527655/ <p> Macbeth has been done many times on stage , and many times on the- silver- screen . Here are the classic Macbeth movies on DVD : <h> Macbeth Movie 1971 : Roman Polanski <p> It is surprising that so few films have been made of Shakespeare 's Macbeth , given that the play is such an exciting drama , filled with all the ingredients that would keep an audience on- the edge of- their seats . <p> Certainly , when Poanskis 1971 Macbeth movie came out in 1971 it was a blockbuster . The cinemas filled up with groupbookings- by schools as teachers crocodiled their students to the local theatre . It met the cinematic expectations of movie-goers of the time , with its extreme and vivid violence , nudity , close-up face to face fighting and special effects . And it was a brilliant resource for students coming to Shakespeare for the first time . If you watch it now it 's almost laughable in its datedness . <p> More serious , though , is its illustration of Polanski 's misunderstanding of the play . When Macbeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his chamber by a dagger that he sees , leading him on . It 's clear that Macbeth is imagining the dagger but Polanski ca n't resist the opportunity for a special effect " a dagger that hangs in the air , glowing , and moving forward , literally leading Macbeth . Although Shakespeare has the stage direction for Banquo 's ghost to appear it is clear in the text that it 's an image of Macbeth 's fear and guilt and the appearance of an actor is a distraction from Macbeth 's reaction . It 's a matter of judgment as whether to have an actual ghost and in this case it 's bad judgment . <p> One of the great aspects of this play is the way Shakespeare manipulates audience response to Macbeth throughout the text . Your sympathies are entirely with Macbeth at first , even and especially after the murder of Duncan , until the brutal slaughter of- Macduff 's family . After that you see Macbeth for the brutal , power-hungry tyrant that he has become . When he eventually accepts his condition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his old self your sympathies return . In the first part of the play Shakespeare takes you deep into Macbeth 's mind and you travel down his path , identifying with his ambition and desire , hardly unaware of the horror you are entering into . And after Duncan 's murder , you are still deep in there , experiencing Macbeth 's fear and guilt for yourself . It is important , therefore , that you do not see Macbeth killing Duncan . That 's why Shakespeare has the murder take place offstage . Polanski ca n't resist inserting a murder scene , thus spoiling the play entirely . When , in the- exact- middle of the play , you see a little child brutally murdered on stage " one of the most horrifying things that can happen in human life " you are shocked and appalled and you 're jerked out of Macbeth 's mind . Shakespeare helps you by showing Macbeth through the eyes of others for the first time . Polanski misses all of that . <p> This may still be a way of introducing students to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and better film versions , particularly The Royal Shakespeare Company 's 1978 version with Ian McKellen and Judi Dench . <h> Macbeth Movie 1978 : Trevor Nunn <p> Nunns 1978 Macbeth movie is not cinematic in any way " it 's theatrical , a television version of the Royal Shakespeare Company 's stage production " but nevertheless a brilliant film . <p> The actors sit in a large circle and come forward for their- performances . Most of the time you are unaware of the circle of actors as the filming is always close-up with the focus on the characters , isolated and lit , with darkness all around them . The language of the play indicates the perpetual darkness , as this is a vision of Hell . Macbeth and Lady Macbeth have turned their castle into a hell and when Duncan enters beneath its portals that 's what he is going into . The comic scene with the porter at the gate spells it out , even if the images of Hell throughout pass you by , which they wo n't because of the way the actors deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acting , and you would n't find better acting anywhere , especially as this is among the finest- performances- of these two great actors . <p> There are no sets , only imaginative lighting and camera work . Colour is muted , the only real colour being the blood on Macbeth 's hands after he has murdered Duncan . The focus is mainly on the faces , which fill the whole screen . McKellen , particularly , conveys Macbeth 's emotions with language combined with facial expression . <p> One of the most striking and memorable moments is when Macbeth says What hands are here ? They pluck out my eyes . ' His hands , gleaming with blood , fill the screen as he contemplates what he has done . As blood is the most important poetic idea in the text much attention is given to that scene . <p> When Banquo 's ghost appears , twice , all you see is McKellen 's face as he suffers extreme guilt and emotional pain . He is physically sick as he confronts the ghost , which , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witches to find out more about his fate , instead of a parade of spirits , which you see in Polanski 's film of 1971 , once again the focus is on McKellen 's face . He makes the language work in the way he deals with it . <p> Judi Dench , dressed throughout in a tight black body suit , appears for the most part , as a white face , the darkness in which she exists being the main feature . <p> This is a version that you must see . It 's entirely faithful to the text , uncut and complete . Trevor Nunn and the two actors show an impressive understanding of the text and their interpretation of it is as definitive as any interpretation could be .

The answer is no , not at all " there is nothing about them that calls for any division al all. - And yet all Elizabethan and Jacobean plays , and in fact , most plays all the way up to and including the 20th century are structured in five acts . <p> The truth , certainly as far as Elizabethan and Jacobean plays are concerned , is that the playwrights did not write them in five acts " that division was done later by the various editors who worked on their plays. - One can see the logic of the division , however . <p> As long ago as 350 BC Aristotle famously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle , and an end , which is the beginning of structure . In his work on dramatic theory Poetics ' Aristotle examined scores of plays and set out his explanation of makes a play work for an audience . According to Aristotle a drama is action " it is all about the events of an individual 's life . It 's not about a character : it 's about the events that derive from character and the events that result from character . It 's not an imitation of character , then , but of life , which , according to Aristotle , consists of action . <p> According to Aristotle the beginning of a play consists of the presentation of a character , someone the audience can identify with . That is a beginning " an opening , a first act . The character makes a decision and performs an action , which moves the play on . That action has consequences , and so it goes on , until that initial action results in a climax , followed by a reversal and then a resolution . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release it at the end in a kind of catharsis . <p> From that one can see a structure , which we still have in drama today " regardless of the number of acts used in print . Aristotle certainly did not divide the action into five sections . It was the Roman critic , Horace , three hundred years after Aristotle , who advocated that , and by the beginning of the first century in Rome it had become conventional . All Seneca 's plays were structured in five separate acts with musical interludes between them . <p> Shakespeare 's texts do not only have five acts and several scenes but each scene indicates the location of the action in that scene . Shakespeare did not do that , nor did he divide the plays into acts and scenes . All that was done for the first time by the playwright Nicholas Rowe- ( 1674-1718 ) , - in his six volume edition of Shakespeare 's plays he edited in 1709 . <p> The German critic , Guystav Freytach ( 1816-1895 ) , attempted to rationalise the five act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposition , introducing the characters and the setting and ending with the play 's significant piece of action . The second act takes that action and complicates it : that 's the complication . In the third act there is a climax , where the fortunes of the character or characters are reversed " either good to bad or bad to worse : that 's the climax . In the fourth act the results of the reversal are played out , putting the final outcome in doubt . This is the resolution . The fifth act winds it all up by presenting the consequences of the resolution and tying up loose ends . That is the denuement . <p> Shakespeare 's plays do not exactly fit any pattern described by such analysis . They conform generally to the Aristotelian model but depart from that in the most wonderfully creative ways while still working for the audience . They also sometimes resemble Freytach 's scheme but do not fit neatly into it . <p> As a rule the division of Shakespeare 's plays into a five act structure is a meaningless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisions Shakespeare makes depend entirely on his own dramatic purpose . Editors divide Antony and Cleopatra into acts and scenes , for example , but the text does not lend itself to that . It moves very quickly to locations around the ancient world , mainly to-ing and fro-ing between Rome and Alexandria in short pieces of action . If Shakespeare came back he would laugh if he were to open a copy of one of his plays and see the division into acts , particularly if Antony and Cleopatra was that play .

@@34527671 @3527671/ <p> As the Elizabethan age gave way to the Jacobean era new young playwrights emerged . They were very much in tune with their sophisticated London audience , who delighted in the spectacle of sex and violence , so Jacobean plays became increasingly sexual and violent . Not only was there killing and wounding with swords and daggers , poisonings , stranglings and torture , but also a great number of minor bloodcurdling acts of physical violence . In The Changeling by Middleton and Rowley , for example , De Flores , one of the most villainous psychopaths of the Jacobean stage , stabs a rival , Alonso , three times while his back is turned . He then spies a diamond ring on his victim 's finger . He tries , but fails , to remove the ring so he just cuts off the finger and puts it in his pocket before disposing of the body . <p> Shakespeare wrote most of his plays during the reign of King James . He , of course , had been in tune with his audiences right from the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humour and classical themes during Elizabeth 's reign . And now he was filling his theatres with plays as violent as those of the best of his fellow theatre writers . Cornwall , a - character in King Lear , matches De Flores ' unthinkable act by pulling out Gloucester 's eyes , with the stage direction he plucks out his eyes . ' <p> With all that violence , all those blood drenched stages , all those dead bodies , the shock value of such things would have been somewhat blunted - so what would shock a Jacobean audience ? Nothing more than the brutal murder of a child onstage , which Shakespeare provides Macbeth . <p> There is nothing superficial about Shakespeare 's plays , though . Unlike some of his contemporaries , his violent plays were never about violence : when he used violence it was always in the pursuit of a greater meaning and the violence was either a device for characterisation , a dramatic device to move the action forward , or something else quite profound . Indeed , he was titillating his audience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always with Shakespeare , he had the larger picture in mind . <p> If the brutal killing of Macduff 's young son is not there simply to satisfy the bloodthirsty taste of the audience then what was it about ? We are used to that scene being there but try and imagine an audience seeing it for the first time . What a shock it must have been , given that most members of the audience had little children and the worst thing they would have been able to imagine would have been the murder of one of them . That scene has been familiar for four centuries but it still shocks when we see it on the stage . <p> The text of Macbeth is infused with blood : Shakespeare uses the word more than forty times . Putting it very simply , the play is about Macbeth 's ambition to be king , and having trod a bloody path to realise that he now finds it to have been a hollow and empty enterprise . His attempt to cover up his route to the throne and simply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lot more blood , - as he sets about eliminating his opposition . <p> Well what about the murder of the child ? - This is where we see the master dramatist at work . Shakespeare 's plays are always manipulations of the audience 's emotions . At the beginning of Macbeth Shakespeare takes care to show them Macbeth as a great popular hero , loved by the king and respected and honoured by the whole of Scotland . Shakespeare builds that in many ways . When Macbeth gets the idea of murdering Duncan and being elected king we follow him down that road as Shakespeare let 's us into his mind with several soliloquies . We do n't see anything else . Macbeth is hesitant . He is still a good man , and we are basically on his side as there are no counter arguments . We also see him as someone who wants to be king but shrinks from the act he has to commit to get there , but he is bullied and manipulated by Lady Macbeth and forced into it . <p> The point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so at this point we are identifying with him and wanting him to win . When he kills Duncan it 's done offstage , and all we see is the blood on his hands and his sense of the horror of what he has done . It 's not particularly horrifying for the audience as we do n't see the killing : if Shakespeare had presented the assassination onstage we would have responded differently . But now Macbeth , crowned king , begins to be paranoid . Shakespeare moves us away from the inner life of Macbeth and we have scenes where other characters talk about his violent suppression of anyone he regards as a threat . We see the murder of his best friend , Banquo , and we hear of other atrocities . We are beginning to not like Macbeth so much but perhaps we can still sympathise with his position . But then we have a scene with an intelligent and endearing child , the son of Macduff , chatting with his mother , wondering what 's happened to his father , who has fled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaughter of Macduff 's family , on the orders of Macbeth , starting with the killing of the child . Directors of productions of the play are able to make that as brutal and bloody as they like . <p> This scene occurs right in the middle of the play " the apex of a structure that leads up to it , with the audience on Macbeth 's side , and follows it with our horror at what a villain he is , allowing us to rejoice in his defeat " another violent act in which he is beheaded , and his head displayed onstage . Shakespeare has manipulated our response and turned us completely . The scene depicting the brutal killing of a child takes us away from our support for Macbeth , leading us to an appalled sense of horror at his actions . <p> The scene is central in every way . The scenes immediately adjacent to it reflect each other , and it goes back to the beginning and forward to the end of the play in that way , the scenes before that scene and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing to that supreme act of violence . <p> Shakespeare has adopted a structure that was used by the great writers of the past " Homer and all the books of the Old and New Testaments in which the writers place their main point at the centre of the book and lead up to and away from it , everything pointing to that main , central point . And so , too Shakespeare , the murder of a child is the main point in Macbeth . This idea has not been generally explored by Shakespearean scholars but it suggests that Shakespeare may have seen ambition 's toll as far worse than simply the downfall of a single protagonist . But whether a member of an audience understood that or not was not as important in the early 17th century as the enjoyment a paying audience derived from witnessing such shocking violence .

@@34527697 @3527697/ <p> You want to know how to write a sonnet like one of Shakespeare 's ? There 's good news and bad news . The good news is that it 's very easy to write a sonnet . The bad news is that your sonnet will unlikley eever be as good as any of Shakespeares ! <p> The reason for this is that every word of Shakespeare 's exactly fits the emotion it 's expressing . In fact , a word in Shakespeare actually becomes the emotion , and when he organises his words into phrases and sentences that applies even more strongly . When Macbeth says , Oh full of scorpions is my mind , dear wife , ' you have a good example of that . Or , when staring at his blood-soaked hands after killing Duncan , he says What hands are here ! Ha " they pluck out mine eyes , ' all the emotion of the predicament he 's in is there . <p> In the sonnets , particularly , although they are only fourteen lines , there is a world of experience in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning , all interacting with all the other expression in the poem . Could you do that ? Could anyone but Shakespeare ? <p> But nevertheless , here 's how to write a sonnet in a few easy steps : <h> 1 . Think of an idea for your sonnet <p> It must be just one single idea . It could be a feeling , like being in love . It could be some thought you 've had about life , or about a person or about people in general . It could be about one of your favourite subjects " sport , music , movies , nature , a book you 've read etc. <h> 2 . Your sonnet must rhyme <p> There must be three sets of four lines and one set of two lines . <p> A set of four lines is called a quatrain . They must follow this pattern . The first quatrain will rhyme like this : abab , for example , rain , space , pain , trace . <p> In the second quatrain you will use different words and it will rhyme like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sun , die . <p> In the third quatrain you will use different words again and it will rhyme like this : efef , for example , boy , man , joy , van . <p> You now have your three Shakespearean quatrains . That 's twelve lines . A sonnet always has fourteen lines . You need a final two and they are called a couplet . So far your sonnet has three quatrains . Once you have written them the sonnet needs a couplet . The rhyme pattern for that is gg . Again , words you have n't used in the rhyming so far . An example is owl and fowl . <h> 3 . Your sonnet must have a metrical pattern <p> Iambus is another word for a two syllable foot . The first syllable will normally be unstressed and the second stressed . For example , de/light , the sun , for/lorn , one day , re/lease . English is the perfect language for iambus because of the way our stressed and unstressed syllables work . <p> Every line of your sonnet must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pentameter simply means five feet . Shakespeare uses iambic pentameter , not only in the sonnets , but also throughout his plays . Pick up any play and look at it . Choose almost any line : But screw your courage to the sticking post ' ( Lady Macbeth ) Read it like this : /but screw/ your cour/age to /the stick/ing post/ Count the feet " there are five . And they are all unstressed followed by stressed syllables . Shakespeare uses iambic pentameter because it closely resembles the rhythm of everyday speech and he wants to imitate everyday speech in his plays . <p> Like Shakespeare you can also trot them out . Try it . If your friend also wants to write a sonnet you can practice talking to each other in iambic pentameter . It comes easily . I wonder what my friends will think of this ? ' If I were you I 'd watch out what I say . ' He never ever told me what to do . ' It 's easy when you think of it like that . ' <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural to English speech .

To help you , here is NoSweatShakespeare 's translation of it into modern English : <p> Shall I compare you to a summers day ? You are more lovely and more moderate : Harsh winds disturb the delicate buds of May , and summer does n't  last long enough . Sometimes the sun is too hot , and its golden face is often dimmed by clouds . All beautiful things eventually become less beautiful , either by the experiences of life or by the passing of time . But your eternal beauty wont fade , nor lose any of its quality . And you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enduring poetry . As long as there are people still alive to read poems this sonnet will live , and you will live in it . <p> The sonnet is about a single idea . Shakespeare is looking at a beautiful summer 's day which , in spite of its beauty , has limitations , and it eventually fades and dies . He 's comparing someone with that beautiful summer 's day but showing that person 's superiority to it . He works the idea through and presents the subject of the poem as having no limitations . Even eventual death wo n't interfere with that because the subject will live forever in the poem , which Shakespeare suggests , will be read as long as there are people to read it . <p> Look at the first two quatrains again . The subject is introduced and we are told that he or she is more beautiful than a summer 's day . The defects of the summer 's day are outlined . Look at the third quatrain . It starts with the word but . ' That marks a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is emphasised . Look at the couplet . It 's a summing up " an assurance that the subject 's beauty will last for as long as there are human beings on Earth . <p> The rhyme scheme is used to change emphasis . Each aspect of the poems ' idea is contained in its own section with its own rhyming word pattern . <p> Can you do it ? Of course you can . Get your idea , decide what you want to say about it and begin structuring it as a sonnet . You know , now , what you have to do . <h> Things to think about <p> Use as many visual images ( word pictures ) as you can <p> Find the right words . <p> Do n't deviate from the iambic pentameter or your sonnet wo n't work . You can make slight variations in the stressing for the sake of varying the rhythm so that you do n't get too much of a **29;63;TOOLONG effect . For example : Let me not to the marriage of true minds . ' If you read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of /true minds/ it sounds unnatural , but it is still iambic pentameter . Shakespeare has used iambic pentameter but he 's varied the meter to create a different rhythm . So although it 's basic iambic pentameter we read it with the following stresses : Let me not to the marriage of true minds . It now sounds like natural speech . Notice how the first three words run into each other as though they 're one word letmenot . But he 's stuck rigidly to the required line structure . Do you think you can do that ? Shakespeare makes these variations a lot in his plays and that 's why you can hear the language as real people speak it but feel the basic metre in your head . <p> Now you know how to write a sonnet , there 's no excuse : It 's time to start work on your own sonnet ! <p> Read out loud in a slightly exaggerated way i.e. break up the words into syllables and aim for that da dum da dum rythm .

There were rigorous- tests- every week and if you did n't  pass you were cruelly sanctioned with physical punishment . <p> Ben Jonson , was n't impressed with the education his best friend had acquired at school because he said of Shakespeare that he had small Latin and less Greek. <p> When he was fourteen Shakespeares father somehow fell from favour and his sons had to leave school . We lose track of William at this point and do n't  see him again until his wedding day . We can be sure that he did n't  just sit around doing nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly as his father was having difficulty in supporting the family . We do n't  know what he did , although his plays show a great deal of knowledge about Elizabethan common occupations such as cobbling , baking , farming and so on . It could have been any of those that he worked at . Perhaps he worked on the farm of Anne Hathaways brother . That would explain a lot ! <p> At some point , though , the teenage Will would have been dreaming about a career in acting . One of the schools customs may have been the most important influence on the boy who was to become the greatest man of the theatre in history . At the end of term the school put on classical plays . How tempting it is to think that young Will caught the acting bug in school plays <p> As for the inner life of this teenager , we can only speculate . He may have written poems that we know nothing about ; he may have made up stories , and even written them down . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be absurd to think that anyone could suddenly write something like the- Henry VI plays in his early twenties , followed by increasingly wonderful plays and poems , without having had a mental and emotional preparation for it that went back to his adolescent years . And certainly , he later captured the intensity of adolescence , going deep into the emotions of those two most famous teenagers in love , - Romeo and Juliet , in a depiction of it that is definitive and identified with by every modern teenager who encounters the play . <p> Shakespeare entered the Kings New school in Stratford , aged 7 . He was afforded this , because his father was an Alderman of Stratford . Two years later , Skakespeare was introduced to Latin by his tutor Simon Hunt , and went on to read and study primarily Latin for the next 5 years . On reaching 14 he was pulled out of school by his fater whose fortune was waning , and put into his fathers shop as a worker in white kid leather , a " wittawer " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended Grammer school in Stratford . There may well be another reason.John Shakespeare &amp; Sir Henry Goodere knew each other &amp; when John had difficulties it is possible that Sir Henry who lived in Polesworth &amp; was also at the centre of The Polesworth Circle ( where people of great lituary learning met ) took William in &amp; was taught in Polesworth . The money going to John . I 'm still working on this theory . But there is plenty of little things to support this idea . What do others think ? 
@@34527705 @3527705/ <p> Want to know where Macbeth- is set ? Shakespeares Macbeth is set mainly in Scotland , with a couple of scenes set in England . The Scottish scenes range from Duncans camp at Forres , to Macbeths castles at Inverness and Dunsinane . And the scenes - with the witches , though presumed in Scotland , are given no specific location by Shakespeare simply referred to as " A desert place " or " A cavern " . <p> Shakespeares language during the some of the Scottish scenes suggest hell and evil . The English scenes , by contrast , indicate a saintly king who sends out his troops to conquor the dark forces that the Scottish king , Macbeth , represents . The play is set in ancient times and there was once a king called Macbeth , but Shakespeare has invented the character he presents in his play : he is nothing like the ancient king who bears his name . <p> The map below shows all the locations Shakespeare used for Macbeth , and below the map is a text list of the locations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show- all of the settings used within the location , using Shakespeare actual wording .

@@34527712 @3527712/ <p> Shakespeare 's plays display countless themes , some of which develop through the body of plays as a whole . The idea , though , that people , events and things in our world are often not what they seem , is at the heart of all the plays . Indeed , some of the plays , for example A Midsummer Night 's Dream and The Tempest , are largely about the confusion between what is real and what is not . This theme of appearance and reality is one that runs through many of Shakespeares plays . <p> What is appearance and reality ? Well , as Shakespeare himself put it : All that glisters is not gold . ' At its most simple level , the way some characters appear to the other characters on the one hand and the way they appear to the audience on the other is often different . Iago in Othello conceals his real nature behind a facade of honesty and is trusted by all , whereas , in his dealings with everyone he is manipulative and remorseless. - In Measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deceitful sexual abuser . Macbeth takes Duncan into his home as a friend while planning to murder him , and acknowledges that false face must hide what the false heart does know . ' <p> Shakespeare 's plays are full of references to men who hide their evil natures behind smiles. - When Hamlet- thinks about his father 's murderer he comments One may smile , and smile , and be a villain . ' - Such observations- about men 's smiles fill the plays : There 's daggers in men 's smiles ' ; Why , I can smile , and murder whiles I smile ' ; Some that smile have in their hearts , I fear , millions of mischief . ' <p> The characters in Shakespeare 's plays often wear masks . The stage convention was that if a character was wearing a mask no-one would recognise him or her , so characters could appear to a friend as a stranger , or as anonymous , or hide his or her identity for any other purpose . <p> Shakespeare found disguise , another of the Elizabethan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance and reality . Disguise was a staple of the Elizabethan stage . <p> Several characters conceal their true identity behind disguises . The Duke of Kent , for example , banished by King Lear , determines to stay with him and look after him : he disguises himself as a servant . The device of disguise is highly dramatic and Shakespeare exploited it to the full . <p> One of Shakespeare 's favourite tricks was to disguise a girl as a boy . Probably the two most famous are Viola in Twelfth Night and Rosalind in As You Like It . In those cases everyone is deceived , regarding appearance as the reality . <p> A Midsummer Night 's Dream is all about confusing appearance and reality . Shakespeare uses various devices to create confusion as to what is real and what is illusion . There are two worlds in the play , the fairy world and the human world . They operate harmoniously but separately . But in this play the fairy world intervenes in the human world and throws up all kinds of illusions as the action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays tricks on the lovers and that makes things seem to be what they are not and bewilders them : Puck becomes confused himself and puts the love potion in the wrong young man 's eyes , further complicating matters .

@@34527713 @3527713/ <p> Shakespeare published 154 sonnets , and although they are all poems that are of the highest quality , there are some that have entered deeply into the consciousness of our culture to become the most famous of Shakespeare 's sonnets . These most famous sonnets are quoted regularly by people at all levels of modern western life " sometimes without even realising that they are quoting a line from a Shakespeare sonnet . <p> The most famous sonnets approach the great universal themes of love and death , or the slow ageing that precedes death . So , what are these most famous sonnets ? In our humble opinion the sonnets below represent Shakespeare 's most famous : <p> Perhaps the most famous of all the sonnets is Sonnet 18 , where Shakespeare addresses a young man to whom he is very close . It would be impossible to say whether Shakespeare was an arrogant man because we do n't know what he was like . We also do n't know whether he thought he was the great , ' immortal writer that we regard him as today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty , he suggests that his poetry is eternal ' and ends by stating that as long as there are people who can still read , the sonnet , and therefore the description of- the young man 's beauty , will still be there . <p> An interesting take on ageing and love . The narrator describes the things that people agonise over as they descend into old age all the regrets and the pain of reliving the mistakes he has made . It 's full of agony but when he thinks about his beloved all the regrets and pain evaporate . <p> This is a poem about loss ; the loss of a loved one . Shakespeare approaches it by expressing the contrast in the way we feel when the morning sun is shining brightly and when it 's obscured by clouds , making the world a forlorn place . When he was loved by the beloved it was like the glorious morning , but now , having lost the beloved , it feels like an overcast and gloomy morning . He concludes that he does n't condemn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity , is just as much a part of nature as the obscuring clouds are . <p> The narrator of Sonnet 73 is approaching death and thinking about how different it is from being young . It 's like the branch of a tree where birds once sang but the birds have gone and the leaves have fallen , leaving only a few dry yellow leaves . It 's like the twilight of a beautiful day , where there is only the black night ahead . It 's like the glowing ashes of a fire that once roared . The things that one gave him life have destroyed his life . From that experience he has learnt that one has to love life as strongly as one can because it will end all too soon . <p> Here Shakespeare expresses the love one person has for another by showing how the beauty of the beloved does n't change in the eyes of the lover . He shows time passing through the seasons and the years , everything changing . Except the beauty of the beloved . He goes further by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though the beloved is long dead there will never be another as beautiful . <p> There are two striking definitions of love that we refer to again and again . Perhaps the most popular of the two is in Paul 's letter to the Corinthians ( Corinthians 13 : 4-8 ) : <p> Love is patient , . Love never ends . <p> Paul 's text is as well known as Sonnet 116 because it is used in most weddings as the young couple stands before the minister . But Shakespeare 's sonnet employs an amazing array of poetic devices to convey the eternal nature of love . Shakespeare ends by staking everything on his observations about love by asserting that if he is wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved . <p> Sonnet 129 is an interesting take on the imperative force of lust , but its ultimate shallowness . Everyone knows how shallow and guilt producing lust is but very few men can avoid it . Shakespeare shows how lust brings out the very worst in people and the extremes they will go to . And then he explains the guilt that follows the satisfaction of one 's lust . <p> Shakespeare is expressing the kind of love that has nothing to do with the beloved 's looks . He satirises the usual way of expressing love for a woman " praising her lips and her hair , the way she walks , and all the things that a young man may rave about when he thinks about his beloved . What he does is invert those things , assert that his beloved is ugly , ungainly , bad-smelling etc , but ends by saying that his love for her is as rare ' as that of any young man who writes flatteringly about the object of his love . 201858 @qwx401858 <p> My Mistress eyes are nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is not going to lie about what his Mistress looks like , after all nobodys eyes are like the sun that would kill and if hair was wire than black wires would grow on her head , if hairs were wires than red wires grow on my head .

The strange thing was that , although the elements raged and the waves churned , the lightning flashed and the thunder roared , the weather on the island was still and calm . It was hot : the sun beat down and the sky was cloudless . The man wore a long cloak and held a staff : the girl , golden haired and pretty , was dressed in a white gown . He stood , unmoving , his face expressionless . She covered her face with her hands and peeped through her fingers . When she saw that the ship had sunk she turned to him . <p> Dearest father , ' she said . If you 've used your magic to stir the sea into this wild roaring , calm it now . The sky seems as though it 's going to drop stinking pitch except that the sea is rising up to its cheek and quenching its fire .

She followed him to the cave , set in a rocky hill , where they lived . <p> Help me take my cloak off , ' he said once they had gone in . <p> She helped him and when the heavy cloak had been removed she folded it and lay it down gently on a table . Lie there , my magic , ' he said . He kissed her , then he led her to a chair and indicated to her to sit down . He pulled up the other chair and faced her . Do n't be concerned ' he said .

If you remember anything of that then you may remember how you got here . ' <p> But I do n't . ' <p> He nodded again . Twelve years ago , Miranda , twelve years ago , your father was the Duke of Milan , a powerful man . ' <p> She sprang up . Are n't you my father ? ' she said . <p> He laughed . Your mother was the picture of virtue and she assured me you were my daughter . ' <p> She sat down again . <p> And your father was the Duke of Milan , and you , no less noble , a princess , and his only heir . ' <p> Oh heavens ! ' she exclaimed . What foul play was there , that drove us away ? ' She paused . Or was it a good thing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both , my girl : we were thrown out by foul play , as you put it , but good fortune helped us to get here . ' <p> Oh , my heart goes out to you when I think about the sorrow I 'm reminding you of , which I ca n't remember , ' she said . Please tell me more . ' <p> My brother , your uncle , Antonio please pay attention . That a brother could be so treacherous ! He whom , apart from you , I loved most in the world ! I delegated the running of the state to him . It was the foremost of all the Italian states and Prospero was a leading duke , highly respected and renowned as a scholar . Because I was absorbed in my learning I loaded him with the work of governing and , being preoccupied with my studies , became remote from the affairs of state . Your deceitful uncle Are you listening ? ' <p> Most attentively , ' she said . <p> Once he had perfected the art of government " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to promote and who to dispose of for being over-ambitious " he either won over or dismissed all my people until he had the keys both of power and the dukedom , which he used to have all the officers of state playing his tune . He became a parasite , the overgrown ivy that both covered the princely tree and sucked the life out of it . Are you still listening ? ' <p> She was most alert . Oh , sir , of course ! ' she said . <p> You must listen , ' he said . And so , in my seclusion and the improvement of my mind , neglect of those worldly things awakened an evil nature in my disloyal brother . His deceitfulness was as great as my unlimited trust in him . My trust in him was boundless . He rose to a great height and became very rich , not only from my legitimate income but also from corruption . He was like an habitual liar who begins to believe his own lies . He began to believe that he was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and carrying out my duties , he had all the privileges and power of a prince . And so , as his ambition grew .. are you listening ? ' <p> This story would cure deafness , ' she said . <p> And , like an actor not recognising the difference between the part he plays and the character he 's playing , he had to be the actual Duke of Milan . As I was a humble man my library was a dukedom large enough for me and he now thought that I was incapable of handling administrative matters . He was so thirsty for influence with the King of Naples that he made an alliance with him , agreeing to pay him an annual levy , recognise his superiority and make himself the king 's subject . It was a humiliating situation for Milan , to become subservient to another state for the first time . ' <p> Oh heavens ! ' exclaimed Miranda . <p> Listen to the terms of the treaty then tell me if this could be a brother . ' <p> It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' said Miranda . Good women have had bad sons . ' Now the treaty , ' said Prospero . This King of Naples was my long time enemy . He listens to my brother 's request , which was that the king would immediately expel you and me from the dukedom and make him the duke officially , in return for his loyalty . So they recruited a treacherous band . One midnight Antonio opened the gates of Milan and they hurried us through them in the dead of night . You were crying . ' <p> Oh , how sad ! ' Miranda took his hand . I do n't remember crying then but I 'll cry now . I feel so sad . ' Prospero stroked her hair . There 's a little more , ' he said , and then I 'll tell you what 's going on now , because it 's connected . ' <p> Why did n't they kill us ? ' <p> Good question , ' he said . My story begs that question . Darling , they did n't dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to complicate it with violence but rather to make it seem better than it was . To cut a long story short , they hustled us on to a ship and took us several miles out to sea . And then they prepared a rotting , useless tub without rigging or tackle : no sails , no mast " even the rats had instinctively deserted it " and put us on board , to be at the mercy of the roaring sea , leaving us to mix our sighs with the howling wind . ' <p> Oh , what a worry I must have been to you ! ' <p> Oh you were an angel and it was you who saved me . You smiled through it , seemingly inspired by heaven , whereas I was feeling sorry for myself and crying profuse tears into the sea . Your smiles gave me the courage to endure whatever was to come . ' <p> How did we come ashore ? ' <p> By divine Providence . There was a good man in charge , a noble Neopolitan called Gonzalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fresh water , and also expensive clothes , linen , and the other necessities that have been so useful to us . Out if decency , he gave me the books from my library that I loved more than my dukedom because he knew how much I valued them . <p> I wish I could meet that man ! ' <p> Prospero stood up . ' I must go , ' he said . But do n't get up . Stay there . Let me tell you the rest . We arrived on this island , and I 've been your teacher here and given you a better education than other princesses have who have more time for silly things , with tutors who do n't care as much as I do . ' <p> Heaven thank you for it , ' she said . Now please tell me , sir , why did you bring this storm on , because it 's still upsetting me ? ' <p> I can tell you this for the time being , ' he said . By a strange co-incidence , Fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this shore . I can tell the future and I can see that I have a guiding star leading me : if I do n't take advantage of its signals I wo n't have another opportunity . No more questions now . ' He raised his hand and moved it slowly from side to side in front of her . Her eyes followed its movement . <p> Miranda 's eyelids flickered . Her head dropped on to her chest and she fell asleep . <p> Prospero went to the entrance of his cave and stood with his arms outstretched . Come here , servant , come , ' he said . I 'm ready . Come to me my Ariel , come . ' <p> A breeze rustled the leaves around the cave 's entrance and a patch of air thickened and began to shape itself into a small human form . It became clearer and materialised as a solid figure that looked like a beautiful child . He stood before Prospero and bowed . <p> All hail , great master , reverend sir , ' he said . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whether you tell us to fly , to swim , to dive into the fire , to ride on the woolly clouds , Ariel and all the other spirits will do it . ' <p> Spirit , have you carried out to the letter the storm I ordered ? ' <p> In every detail , ' said Ariel . I boarded the king 's ship . Now on the prow , now on the deck , and in every cabin , I flared terror . Sometimes I divided myself and burnt in many places : I appeared on the topmast , the yardarms and the bowsprit as separate flames , then reassembled and burnt as one big fire . I flashed more brilliantly and more profusely than Jove 's lightning bolts that come before his dreadful thunderclaps . The lightning and roaring thunder were enough to frighten the most mighty Neptune , making his bold waves tremble and his dreadful trident shake . ' <p> My intrepid spirit ! ' said Prospero . Was there anyone so firm and steady that this uproar did n't terrify him ? ' <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , apart from the crew , plunged into the foaming , salty sea , abandoning the ship , which was by then all on fire from me ! The king 's son , Ferdinand , his hair all standing up " more like reeds than hair was the first one to jump , shouting , hell is empty : all the devils are here ! ' Ariel laughed , his voice ringing our clearly like joyful music . <p> Prospero joined him in laughing . That 's my spirit , ' he said . It was near the shore , though , was n't it ? ' Very near , my master . ' <p> They are safe , though , Ariel ? ' <p> Not a hair on their heads harmed . Not a spot on their clothes , which spread out to help them float : they 're fresher than they were before . I 've distributed them around the island in groups , just as you told me to . I landed the king 's son by himself , in a remote cove , sighing hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded in despair . Like this . ' Ariel threw himself down and showed Prospero how he had left Ferdinand sitting . Then he sprang up again , laughing . <p> What have you done with the king 's ship , the sailors , and the rest of the fleet ? ' <p> The king 's ship is safely in harbour : hidden in a deep cove , the one where you called me up at midnight , that time you wanted me to fetch dew from the stormy Burmudas . That 's where she 's hidden . The sailors are all stowed below deck where I 've left them asleep , combining a magic spell with their exhaustion from their efforts . I scattered the rest of the fleet and they have joined up again , and they 're now in the Mediterranean Sea , bound sadly home for Naples , believing that they saw the king 's ship wrecked and watched him drown . <p> At least two o'clock . We must both use the time between now and six carefully . ' <p> Ariel looked surprised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many jobs let me remind you of what you promised me , and that you have n't done yet . ' <p> What ? Cheeky ? What could you demand ? <p> My freedom. <p> Before your time is up ? ' <p> Ariel opened his mouth to speak . <p> No more ! ' said Prospero sternly . <p> Ariel persisted . Please , ' he said . Remember , I 've served you well . I have n't told you any lies , I 've made no mistakes , and never complained about the work . You promised to free me a full year early . ' <p> Have you forgotten the torment that I freed you from ? ' <p> No . ' <p> You have ! And you 've started to think that walking on the mud of the ocean floor , or riding on the sharp north wind , or doing things for me deep in the frost-bound earth , is too much for you !

' <p> No , sir , ' said Ariel quietly . <p> You have ! Where was she born ? Speak : Tell me ! ' <p> Sir , in Algiers . ' <p> Oh , is that so ? ' said Prospero sarcastically . I have to tell you once a month what it was like for you , or you forget . That despicable witch was banished from Algiers for countless mischiefs and spells too terrible for human ears . You know that . There was a reason why they would n't execute her . Is n't that true ? ' <p> Yes , sir . ' <p> This hag , her eyes blue from her condition , was brought here pregnant , and left here by the sailors . You " my slave , as you call yourself " were her servant then . And because you were a spirit too delicate to carry out her base and disgusting orders , you refused to obey her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic , she imprisoned you in a split pine tree . You stayed there , trapped , for a dozen years , because she died and left you there in pain , where you groaned like a mill wheel grinding against stone .

Caliban , whom I now use as a servant . You know full well the torment you were in when I found you . Your groans made wolves howl and bad-tempered bears feel sorry for you . It was a torment fit for the damned and it was too late for Sycorax to undo it . It was my magic , when I arrived here and heard you , that opened the pine and let you out . ' <p> Ariel was subdued . There was a tear in his eye .

' <p> Do that , ' said Prospero , and I 'll discharge you in two days ' time . ' <p> Ariel rose up into the air and his laughter came again . That 's my wonderful master , ' he said . What do you want me to do ? Tell me what ! What do you want me to do ? ' <p> Go and transform yourself into the likeness of a sea-spirit . Make yourself invisible to everyone except me .

Come on , let 's go and see Caliban . He 'll be as aggressive as ever . ' <p> Miranda shuddered . He 's awful , sir , I hate the sight of him . ' <p> I know , ' said Prospero , but we ca n't get along without him . He makes our fire , fetches our wood and does all those necessary things . ' <p> They walked along the path to his cave . As they came near Prospero called to him . Hey ! Slave ! Caliban ! Speak , you piece of dirt ! ' <p> Caliban , wearing a cloak made out of old sacks , crawled out of his cave and screwed his eyes up against the brightness of the day . He was caked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looked Miranda up and down , then turned to Prospero . <p> May a poisonous dew , as deadly as any that my mother scooped up from a stinking swamp with a raven 's feather , drop on both of you , ' he said .

Goblins will torture you all through the long dark night . They 'll pinch you till you 're like a honeycomb , with each of their pinches stinging you more painfully than bee stings . ' <p> Caliban grunted . He turned away . I must eat my dinner , ' he said . Then he turned back and looked defiantly at Prospero . This island 's mine ! It belonged to my mother , Sycorax , and you stole it from me ! When you first came here you pampered me and made a fuss of me . You gave me water with berries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the moon .

And now you keep me confined to this stye of hard rock , denying me the run of the island . ' <p> You lying rogue ! ' Prospero raised his hand as though to strike him . The only thing you understand is whipping . Not kindness . You 're filth . I treated you with human kindness , and even allowed you to sleep in my cave , until you tried to rape my child ! ' <p> Caliban laughed loudly and raucously . Then he looked at Miranda again and licked his lips . I wish I 'd succeeded . You stopped me , or I would have populated this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with anger . Ignoring her father 's restraining hand , she took a step towards him . You disgusting rogue ! ' she exclaimed . You 're unable to respond to kindness . And you 're capable of any evil thing . I felt sorry for you and took a lot of trouble to teach you to speak . I spent every hour of the day teaching you one thing or another . When you ' Tears ran down her cheek as she thought about it you savage , could n't make any sounds that had meaning , just gabbling like an animal , I taught you how to talk , and express your thoughts . But even though you did learn , your vile nature had something in it that made it impossible for good people to be anywhere near you . That 's why you were confined to this rock , although you deserved a greater punishment than imprisonment !

If you refuse to do your work , or do it reluctantly , I 'll give you cramps , make all your bones ache , so that you 'll roar so loudly that animals will tremble at the noise . ' <p> He raised his hand . Pains immediately gripped Caliban and he started howling . He threw myself down on the ground and rolled about . No please ! ' he cried . He knew he had to obey . His masters magic was so powerful that it could even control the god , Setebos , whom his mother had served , and turn him into a slave . <p> Prospero lowered his arm and Caliban stopped writhing .

Within a few moments they heard Ariel 's voice , singing somewhere below them , to the accompaniment of a lute . He was invisible to Miranda but what Prospero saw was the spirit floating gently on the air , strumming on his lute and singing . He passed his hand in front of her eyes and they fell shut . The music grew louder and soon they were able to hear his words . <p> Come unto these yellow sands , And then take hands : Curtsied when you have and kissed The wild waves whist : Foot it featly here and there , And sweet sprites bear The burthen .

' He stopped . I cant hear it anymore . I 'm sure its meant for some god of this island . This music crept past me over the water as I was sitting on a beach weeping again about my fathers wreck , calming both the storm and my feelings with its sweet sound : so I followed it , or rather , its drawn me here .

@@34527720 @3527720/ <p> This article discusses Shakespeare &amp; suicide . The society that Shakespeare creates in the world of his plays is recognisable to audiences as a representation of the society of the real world . And so , therefore , - as there are suicides in real life , there are suicides in Shakespeare 's plays . Characters take their own lives for many reasons , some which are shocking to Elizabethan audiences and others which they understand : the suicides in the Roman plays are completely different from the suicides of- characters like Romeo and Juliet , Ophelia , Lady Macbeth , Iago , and- the suicide that Hamlet seems to be contemplating- at one point in the drama . <p> Scholars have argued for thirteen explicit suicides in Shakespeare 's plays , with more possible suicides where a character 's death is not detailed and the audience is left to interpret the death on its own. - The thirteen are : <p> Brutus ( Julius Caesar ) <p> Cassius ( Julius Caesar ) <p> Cleopatra ( Antony and Cleopatra ) <p> Charmian ( Antony and Cleopatra ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juliet ) <p> Lady Macbeth ( Macbeth ) <p> Ophelia ( Hamlet ) <p> Othello ( Othello ) <p> Mark Antony ( Antony and Cleopatra ) <p> Portia ( Julius Caesar ) <p> Romeo ( Romeo and Juliet ) <p> Timon ( Timon of Athens ) <p> It is not at all clear that these are all actual suicides , however , and some have argued that because they do not all take place onstage and that it is not explicitly stated that they are all suicides those should not be counted as definite suicides . For example , Ophelia 's death by drowning could have been an accident due to her agitated state , or she could have died from a deranged mind . - One of the grave diggers suggests that she was a suicide but that is the only indication , and in any case , it 's only his opinion : he has no idea of the background to her case . Lady Macbeth 's death , too , is not a clear suicide , although it seems likely . Macbeth is told that she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her is a suffering woman , experiencing nightmares as a result of her guilt . Elizabethan writers did not have the benefit of the knowledge we have of medical science , and dying of guilt , a deranged mind , or of a broken heart , was not out of the question . Brutus ' wife , Portia , is not a clear suicide either . We are not told that she is , and Brutus simply receives news that she has died . We know that she was an unhappy woman , and in deep political trouble , but we are not told anything about the manner of her death . <p> In most of those thirteen cases , though , it is in the interests of the drama that the suicide should be clear . Shakespeare makes the onstage suicides big dramatic moments that contribute to the movement of the drama . The implied suicides are not in themselves dramatic : they take many forms " such as Enobarbus who , desperately ashamed of himself for having betrayed Antony , dies in a lonely ditch . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have killed himself " we do n't know . There are some unseen suicides among the characters in the history plays , and in those cases , being historical characters , we know that they did commit suicide , even if Shakespeare does n't show or tell us that . <p> Suicide was a sensitive matter in Tudor times . During that period both the church and the state took a strict view on suicide , regarding it as a mortal sin which was linked to deep despair and demonic pride . The word suicide ' only appeared in the English language long after Shakespeare 's death . Until then it was called self-murder ' and was regarded as the crime of murder , and was illegal , with survivors of suicide being prosecuted . St. Augustine in- The City of God- had argued that God 's command Thou shalt not kill ' should be extended to include the taking of an individual 's own life , and that became the guide for mediaeval society . The term self-murder ' points to the stigma attached to such an act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved one listed in death records as murderers and therefore went to great lengths to cover up suicides in the family . They paid bribes to the authorities , for example , to prevent too close an examination of a cause of death . It was important to conceal the cause of a suicide victim 's death so as to secure a Christian burial . In- Hamlet- we see the gravediggers discussing the fact that Ophelia 's controversial death might not warrant Christian burial rites . <p> With suicide an uncomfortable concept for Elizabethan audiences " a taboo subject in England , in fact " Shakespeare trod carefully when representing it in his tragedies . Most of his suicides took place in foreign settings " Verona , Denmark , etc. thereby distancing them from the London audience . Only three suicides occur in Britain . In the case of Romeo and Juliet , the suicides as far away as distant Italy spare audiences the discomfort that suicide provoked and allowed them to sympathise with rather than condemn the couple . <p> The Roman suicides were an entirely different matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect their reputation , or to avoid a subsequent and inevitable disgraceful life. - The prime examples are in Julius Caesar , where the conspirators , Cassius and Brutus , fall on their swords as a result of their humiliating defeat by Octavius Caesar and Mark Antony .

Then , if he ever really loved her , he 'll mourn for her and wish he had never accused her . No , not even if he still believed his accusation to be well-founded . Do this and do n't doubt that it will be successful " more so than I can say .

@@34527737 @3527737/ <p> A common mistake we 're to make when trying to transpose any Shakespearean expression- from Renaissance English to contemporary modern English is to ignore its context and see it in the context of our own time . This often gives rise to charge against Shakespeare of such modern concepts as racism , ' anti-semitism ' or sexism . ' Another complication is that we sometimes forget that Shakespeare never speaks to his audience " it is always one of his characters talking. - We have no idea of what Shakespeare thinks about anything : he is essentially an observer of human life , which he reports through the interaction of his characters , and so we see a range of attitudes to and statements about any of the many subjects he addresses in his plays . <p> We see an example of this in The Merchant of Venice .

We see Juliet driven to desperate measures at the hands of the men in Romeo and Julietand Ophelia driven to suicide in Hamlet in the same way , but we also see Juliet 's extraordinary qualities of strength , determination and an overwhelming capacity for love . In general , Shakespeare 's women are intelligent , strong and compassionate " more so than most of the men in the plays . <p> Translating any seemingly contentious utterance by one of Shakespeare 's characters is made difficult , partly for the above reasons and partly because of the fact that the language of Shakespeare 's plays is compacted into poetry , each utterance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder each utterance was written four hundred years ago in the context of a society far distant in its concerns from ours .

However , many of his characters are not fantastical but are quite realistic . What I mean by this is that they are based on realistic mindsets , morays , and behaviors that many in his time had . You can glean this from comparing what he says to other literature , letters , etc of the time . And you often find consistent global mindsets about certain things that are characteristic of the time . The truth is that in many ways women were seen as the property of men . That people of color were seen as exotic and often in a pejorative way .

He had got into a fight and drawn a knife , upon which his opponent drew his and fatally stabbed Marlowe in the eye . Some researchers have posed the idea that he was deliberately provoked as part of an assassination plot to eliminate him so that he could not testify against some important men , including Walter Raleigh , in a coming trial . <p> Christopher Marlowe- was the son of a shoemaker and is one of the most famous old boys of King 's School , Canterbury .

I frown at him and yet he still loves me , ' she said . <p> Do n't worry , ' said Hermia . He wo n't see me again . Lysander and I are going to run away . Before I met Lysander Athens seemed like a paradise . What a wonderful man , that can turn a heaven into a hell . ' <p> We 'll confide in you , Helena , ' said Lysander .

And Lysander carried on walking , to his own house . <p> Helena , left on her own , walked slowly on , deep in thought . How much happier some people were than others ! The whole of Athens considered her as beautiful as Hermia , but so what ? Demetrius did n't think so . He refused to realise what everyone else took for granted . But just as he was mistaken in his obsession with Hermia 's eyes , she was probably at fault , too , for admiring Demetrius ' qualities . Love can transform things that are unpleasant and not to be admired into something beautiful and dignified . Love looks with the mind , not the eyes , and that was why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love does n't have good judgement either : his wings and blindness suggest that he rushes into things without looking .

Before Demetrius fell in love with Hermia he swore his oaths , thick as hail , to only her . And then the heat from Hermia affected the hailstorm : his love dissolved and the hail showers all melted away . <p> She would go and tell him about Hermia 's plan to run away . Then he would also go to the wood .

He wrote long poems on historical subjects as well as autobiographical verse .

He was famous in all those areas , but will be particularly remembered for two of his novels , Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty Four , both among the most significant works of literature of the twentieth century and two of the most influential . <p> Three of his non-fiction collections are classics of journalism . Down and Out in Paris and London ( 1933 ) tells the story of living as a tramp in those two rich cities ; The Road to Wigan Pier ( 1937 ) is a close observation of the working class in the north of England and Homage to Catalonia ( 1938 ) is an account of his activities in the Spanish Civil War . <p> A keen observer of the trends of his time Orwell forged his two great novels from those observations and , particularly in the case of Nineteen Eighty Four he emerged as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be heading . In the novel people have become dehumanised , governed by an unseen administration that controls them with a fast-growing technology . The novel makes the future look bleak . Governments since the book came out have often been warned by their critics of bringing the country closer to nineteen eighty four , with the increase of such things as censorship and camera surveillance . The language Orwell used in writing this novel contains many words and phrases which he employed to create the dystopian world of the novel . <p> George Orwell photo <p> Some of the words and phrases he invented have entered into the English language and are used routinely , eg. Big Brother , thought police , Room 101 , thoughtcrime , doublethink . <p> Animal Farm is a short novel that depicts the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the beginning of the Stalin era . The story is told using the techniques of allegorical fiction . The characters are animals and different groups of Soviet society are represented by the classes of animals , eg. The proletarians are sheep , the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dogs etc . The novel is written in such a way as to be accessible to everyone , and can be read on one level by a child . It is a remarkable book that explores the Revolution - in great depth in a short text . <p> Apart from his linguistic inventiveness in his novels Orwells style when writing essays and journalism is very plain and simple , clear and lucid . He set out rules for that kind of writing that included using short words , fresh metaphors if metaphors are needed , cut out any words that it is possible to cut out , do n't use scientific language or jargon or foreign phrases and do n't  use the passive case . Employing those rules in his own writing Orwell produced a very high level of communication .

To describe something as Orwellian is to refer , not just to a kind of writing but a kind of situation in which a population is controlled by misinformation , surveillance , the rewriting of history and the policing of - peoples'thoughts.

You tailors yard , you scabbard , you bow-case , you unutterable rigid rapier ! He ran out of breath and sat back gasping . <p> Well take a couple of breaths and start again , Hal said . And when you 've exhausted yourself with vile comparisons , just listen to this one thing. <p> Falstaff opened his mouth to continue but Poins stopped him .

Then we attacked you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you from your takings , and we still have them , yes , and can show them to you right here in this house .

What a wretch you are to hack your sword blade , as you have done , and then say it was in fighting . What trick , what device , what bolt-hole , can you now invent to hide yourself from this open and obvious disgrace ? <p> Come on , let 's hear it , said Poins . What trick are you going to come up with now ? <p> Falstaff looked bewildered but that did n't  last long . He slapped his thigh and burst into coarse laughter .

Then he turned to Poins , who was staring at him in amused disbelief . But by the Lord , lads , I 'm glad you 've got the money . Hostess , lock the doors ! Party tonight , pray tomorrow ! Fun , lads , boys , hearts of gold ! May you have all the titles of good fellowship . Well ? Shall we get on with the entertainment ?

Hal bowed as his friends showed their appreciation . <p> What kind of man is he ? said Falstaff . <p> An old man , the landlady said . <p> What 's respectability doing out of his bed at midnight ? said Falstaff . Shall I give him his answer ? <p> Please do , Jack. <p> Falstaff scrambled to his feet , full of enthusiasm . God help me , I 'll send him packing , he said as he scampered away . <p> Now , gentlemen , the Prince said , looking round at Falstaffs unusually quiet satellites .

I did what I have n't done for seven years . I blushed while listening to his monstrous schemes. <p> Hal pointed to Bardolphs features " the bulbous red nose and the cheeks inflamed with pimples and boils . Villain ! he said .

Damn all this sighing and sorrow : it blows a man up like a balloon. He waved the Prince silent , cutting off his response with : Theres terrible news going round . Sir John Bracy is here , from your father . You have to go to the court in the morning . That mad fellow of the north " Percy " and the one in Wales who is supposed to have beaten the devil up and cuckolded Lucifer and enslaved him on a Welsh hook .

He had an alarming coughing fit and when he had recovered he sighed . Well , anyway , that rascals made of good stuff : he wont turn and run. <p> Ill grant you that . On instinct . Well , he s there , too , and that fellow , Mordake , and a thousand blue-capped Scots as well . Worcester stole away during the night : your fathers beard has turned white at the news . You can buy land now as cheaply as rotten fish. <p> Well then , Hal said , its likely that if its a hot June and this war is still going on well be able to buy virgins as you can buy hob-nails " by the hundreds. <p> En mass , lad , that 's for sure .

Humour me by practicing your reply. <p> You play my father and question me about my lifestyle. <p> Shall I ? Alright ! Falstaff pulled a chair out from a nearby table .

Harry , he said , I do not only marvel at where you spend your time , but also at the company you keep .

There is a substance , Harry , which youve often heard of , commonly known in England as pitch . This pitch , as ancient writers have recorded , defiles , and so does the company you keep . Harry. Falstaff pulled a grimy handkerchief out of his pocket and mopped his cheeks dramatically .

And I think he s about fifty , perhaps approaching three score , and Ive just remembered , his name is Falstaff . If that man is in any way inclined to corruption then he s deceived me because , Harry , I can see that that he s virtuous . If the tree is known by its fruit and the fruit known by the tree , then I say emphatically that there is virtue in that Falstaff . Keep with him and banish the rest of them .

Everyone laughed and Falstaff bowed his head towards them , like an actor acknowledging applause . Yes , he said , I 'll give you a young prince that will make you laugh. <p> Hal leant forward and slapped him on the head . Are you swearing , you profane boy ? From now on , stay out of my sight .

If I do n't  become the hangmans cart as well as any other man , to hell with my bringing up ! As far as Im concerned Im as good a man as any who 's strangled by a noose. <p> Go and hide behind the curtain , Hal said . The rest of you go upstairs .

He used the seasons and the weather in his poetry , just as he used everything else in nature . His plays and sonnets are crammed with imagery of the seasons , not least of all winter .

They stood staring at each other , all of them itching to let fly , when a well dressed young man emerged from one of the streets that led off the piazza . <p> Abraham had been controlling himself admirably until now , but now the balance was tipped by the arrival of a Montague . The temptation was too great . He tapped Sampsons chest with his forefinger . There 's something I have to tell you , ' he said . My masters better than yours . ' <p> The Montagues swords were already in their hands . In an instant the four were fighting , their rapiers reflecting the morning sunlight in sharp bright flashes . <p> The well dressed youth was Montagues cousin , Benvolio , the last young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was returning from an early morning walk . When he saw the fighting servants he started running towards them . <p> Stop it ! ' He drew his own rapier and charged in among them , trying to part them . Stop ! ' he yelled . Stop it ! ' <p> A crowd had gathered , attracted by the shouting . Among them was the fiery nephew of Capulet himself . He was a restless young fellow called Tybalt . Unlike Benvolio , he could n't resist a fight . The mere sight of a Montague was enough to make his blood boil . <p> Hey , Benvolio , ' he called . Fancy finding you fighting with servants . Why do n't  you pick on a man ? ' When Benvolio ignored him he drew his sword and touched the young Montague 's shoulder with it . Turn , ' he said dramatically , And face your death . ' <p> Forget it , Tybalt. ' panted Benvolio . He did n't  take Tybalt 's frequent theatrical displays seriously at the best of times and now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men from fighting , he was n't in the mood for Tybalt 's nonsense at all . He shrugged the end of the young Capulet 's sword from his shoulder . <p> I 'm trying to keep the peace . Put your sword away . Or use it to help me part these men . ' <p> What ? ' said Tybalt . A sword in your hand and talking about- peace ? Do n't  make me laugh . I hate that word . Just as I hate all Montagues . And especially you ! ' And with that he made a lunge at Benvolio , forcing him to turn and defend himself . <p> The four servants were still fighting and others had joined in . More people were pouring out of the houses around the piazza and the narrow streets that led off it . The fighters were trampling over stalls , squashing fruit and sending chickens and piglets squawking and squealing in panic . <p> An officer of the citys Watch arrived . Waving his longsword above his head he shouted to the people to help him part the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These damned Montagues . Curse them all ! Down with the lot of em ! ' <p> By now the whole piazza was in turmoil . Some people fought while others tried to stop them . Wounded men squirmed in the dust and market stalls lay in ruins . <p> Capulet came running on to a balcony of his house , followed by his wife . He still wore his nightgown . What 's this racket ? ' he said . Get me my longsword ' <p> Do n't  be absurd , ' said Lady Capulet . You need a crutch , more like it . What would you do with a sword ? ' But Capulet meant it . He could see his enemy , Montague , down in the piazza , waving his sword at him , taunting him challenging him to come out and fight . Get me my sword ! ' he demanded . <p> Montague was shouting up at him . You villain , Capulet ! Come out and fight like a man . ' Lady Montague was pulling him back , trying to calm him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gripped his cloak even more tightly . Leave me alone . Come on , Capulet ! Come on , then ! ' <p> Just as Montague broke loose from his wifes grasp and was rushing to meet Capulet , who had answered his challenge by coming out to the piazza , still in his nightgown , there was the furious brassy sound of trumpets dozens of them . Every citizen knew what that fanfare meant . Even Tybalt , although at an advantage in his fight with Benvolio , lowered his sword and turned towards the palace that dominated the piazza with its huge columns and vast porch . The Prince himself , accompanied by scores of his courtiers and officers , was hurrying down the stairs . <p> The fanfare died away and silence spread across the piazza . Everyone watched as the Prince strode to the fountain and stepped up on to the wall . He looked around at his subjects . His face was solemn . His stern gaze fell on Montague and Capulet who stood side by side , their swords still drawn . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then : <p> This is the third time that you , Capulet , and you , Montague , have disturbed the tranquillity of our city and obliged the elders of Verona to make peace between you , ' he said . He paused and allowed his eyes to roam over the devastation . It seems it has n't  worked . You are both so blighted with hatred . ' His eyes flashed with anger . So this is what I 'm going to order . If you ever disturb our streets again you 'll pay for it with your lives . ' <p> A murmur went up among the crowd . The Prince had never gone this far . But by the look of him he meant it ! He was sick and tired of this stupid feud between two of Verona 's wealthiest families and now he was going to do something about it at last . And they all knew that he meant it . <p> Now go home , all of you , ' he ordered his subjects . <p> Wait , Capulet , ' he said as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you , Montague , come and see me this afternoon : I 'll let you know then what else Ive decided . Now all of you , go home . ' <p> Within five minutes the only people left were the wounded and the market traders who , with varying degrees of stoicism , began to put their stalls back together . The injured were trying to pick themselves up : if they did n't  hurry the Princes guards would begin rounding them up . <p> Benvolio walked to the Montague house with his uncle and aunt . Fortunately he was n't hurt , although his thoughts about Tybalt were not the most generous . <p> What happened ? ' said Montague . Were you there when it started ? ' ' <p> Benvolio explained about the servants and about the way Tybalt had attacked him how Tybalts sword had whistled round his head so that there was no way he could have ignored it . <p> Lady Montague was n't interested in how it had started . All she felt was relief at knowing her son had n't  been involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you seen him today ? ' <p> Who ? ' <p> Romeo . Have you seen him ? ' <p> Benvolio smiled . I think he s avoiding me . I could n't sleep last night and I got up early , before dawn . I went for a walk to the sycamore grove on the outskirts of the city . ' <p> He pointed down the alley that ran along the side of Montagues house . And he was there . I called to him but as soon as he heard me he dived into the woods . He did n't  want to talk to me . Well , I had my own problems , so I dropped it . ' <p> Hmm , ' said Montague . I 've heard that he often goes there before dawn . They tell me he does a lot of crying . And as soon as the sun comes up he hurries home , goes to his room and closes the shutters . Somethings definitely wrong . ' <p> Have you any idea why he s acting so strangely ?

How can I help him if he wo n't say anything ? ' <p> As they were going in Benvolio caught sight of Romeo coming up the street . <p> There he is ! ' he said . Go in . Ill wait for him . I 'm determined to get to the bottom of this . ' <p> Bless you , ' said his aunt . <p> Come on . ' said her husband . Good luck , Benvolio . ' <p> Benvolio strolled slowly down the street . Hi . ' he said as he got near to Romeo . <p> He bent his head and tried to catch his cousins eye . Good morning . ' <p> Romeo pretended not to see him . Benvolio bent his head even further and looked right up into his cousins lowered eyes so that Romeo couldnt ignore him any longer . <p> Good morning , ' said Benvolio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is the day so young ? ' <p> Only just gone nine . ' <p> Oh dear , ' said Romeo . He sighed again . How the time drags when you 're sad . Was that my father I just saw ducking into the house ?

' <p> Out of the favour of the girl I love . ' <p> Dear oh dear . ' said Benvolio , trying not to laugh . Its a hard life . That love , such a gentle thing , should be so rough when it comes down to it . ' <p> Yes , ' said Romeo . I do n't  want to talk about it . Where shall we go for lunch ?

But before Benvolio could answer he sighed yet again . Do n't  tell me . ' He shook his head sadly . I know all about it . This is about hatred . <p> But I 'm thinking only about love . Oh , everything is upside down . ' He looked sharply at Benvolio . Are you laughing at me ? ' <p> Would I do that ? ' said Benvolio . You make me want to cry . ' <p> Why ? ' <p> Because you 're so pathetic . ' <p> Its love that makes me pathetic , ' said his cousin . But do n't  give it another thought . Youve got more to think about . ' His eyes filled with tears . If you start feeling sorry for me itll only make things worse . So goodbye . ' <p> Hold on . ' said Benvolio . Ill walk with you . ' <p> Where to ? I 'm not here . This is n't me .

There is no love just lust in the play because not to mention that they were not even old enough to feel what true love is . You do not feel love unless you are 20 to 21 .

They were joint owners of The Globe Theatre , together with John Heminges , Augustine Phillips and Thomas Pope . Shakespeare left him twenty-six shillings and eightpence in his will to buy a ring . <p> Like his friend William Shakespeare , Burbage was multi-talented . He was a theatre entrepreneur and artist , but he is most famous as an actor " one of the leading actors of his time . While Shakespeare wrote the great plays for the Chamberlaine 's Men and later the King 's Men , Burbage starred for the company and played the great leading roles of Hamlet , Macbeth and King Lear . This did n't  stop Burbage also appearing in various productions of Shakespeares contemporaries Johnson et al . - Some four centuries before the emergence of an acting style known as method acting , ' where the actor assumes a role and lives it out in his daily life , Burbage had adopted that approach . <p> He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard , his father , and his brother Cuthbert , worked together to develop London 's theatre world .

@@34527826 @3527826/ <p> I often come across the question Why is there so little of Christmas in the works of Shakespeare ? ' . In all of his works , Shakespeare uses the word Christmas ' only three times . <p> Well the answer is simple , really . The way we celebrate that jolly season is effusive , full and sumptuous , but its roots are in the 1840s . Before that it was hardly celebrated at least not in the way we celebrate it today . Easter was the big Christian festival , a festival of grief followed swiftly by a parallel festival of joy as the Saviour first dies then rises again on the third day . The Bible is n't clear about the time of Jesus ' birth but it is about the season of rebirth is : it 's the time when all nature wakes from the death of winter . At least in the northern hemisphere . <p> Over the centuries the idea of Christmas developed to a point where it became a twelve day festival , starting on Christmas day , moving on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boxing Day ) and culminating on Twelfth Night . In Elizabethan England Twelfth Night was the occasion for theatrical performances at the royal court . It 's matter of convention that Shakespeare wrote his wonderful play , Twelfth Night , for the last night of the Christmas season . It 's a practical , unimaginative title , and has nothing to do with Christmas , referring only to the time for which its performance was intended . <p> Shakespeare does give us one description of Christmas however , on the frozen battlements of Elsinore in Hamlet : <p> Some say that ever gainst that season comes Wherein our Saviours birth is celebrated , The bird of dawning singeth all night long : And then , they say , no spirit dare stir abroad ; The nights are wholesome ; then no planets strike , No fairy takes , nor witch hath power to charm , So hallowed and so gracious is the time . <p> It 's a description of a highly spiritual atmosphere , a hallowed ' time in which everything evil is refused admission . There is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are also several descriptions of midwinter scenes in Shakespeare but they are n't connected with Christmas , although they are the inspiration for Christmas card pictures . <p> We have to wait for the Victorians with Queen Victoria and particularly her husband , Prince Albert , both Germans , introducing the modern Christmas into England and popularising it . Perhaps the thing Prince Albert is most famous for is the introduction of the decorated Christmas tree , a German tradition that became fashionable in England and established very quickly . Charles Dickens ' description of a Christmas dinner in A Christmas Carol clinched Christmas as we know it and set it in our culture for all time . It 's worth a read , to get your juices going for the big day . <p> Mrs Cratchit made the gravy ( ready beforehand in a little saucepan ) hissing hot ; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour ; Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple-sauce ; Martha dusted the hot plates ; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table ; the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and mounting guard upon their posts , crammed spoons into their mouths , lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped . At last the dishes were set on , and grace was said . It was succeeded by a breathless pause , as Mrs Cratchit , looking slowly all along the carving-knife , prepared to plunge it in the breast ; but when she did , and when the long expected gush of stuffing issued forth , one murmur of delight arose all round the board , and even Tiny Tim , excited by the two young Cratchits , beat on the table with the handle of his knife , and feebly cried Hurrah ! <p> There never was such a goose . Bob said he did n't  believe there ever was such a goose cooked . Its tenderness and flavour , size and cheapness , were the themes of universal admiration .

Suppose it should break in turning out ? Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the back-yard , and stolen it , while they were merry with the goose a supposition at which the two young Cratchits became livid ? All sorts of horrors were supposed . <p> Hallo ! A great deal of steam ! The pudding was out of the copper . A smell like a washing-day . That was the cloth .

Mrs Cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind , she would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity of flour . Everybody had something to say about it , but nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family . It would have been flat heresy to do so . Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing . <p> At last the dinner was all done , the cloth was cleared , the hearth swept , and the fire made up .

@@34527827 @3527827/ <p> Playwright John Webster was born sometime in about 1580 . Little is known of his early years but it is thought that he was a practising lawyer . His father , also John Webster , a coach maker , married a blacksmiths daughter named Elizabeth Coates . They lived in St. Sepulchres parish . Father John , and Uncle , Edward Webster , were Freemen of the Merchant Taylors Company and Webster attended Merchant Taylors School in Suffolk Lane , London . <p> At the beginning of the 17th century Webster collaborated with Thomas Dekker on Westward Ho . He produced nothing between 1605 and 1611 , then he wrote The Duchess of Malfi , which was performed both at the Globe public theatre and Blackfriars playhouse . The play is considered to be among the finest of all Jacobean tragedies . <p> Webster probably died sometime in the 1630s , but that is no more than an educated guess as the Great Fire of London in 1666 destroyed all of the parish records . <p> Webster 's two most famous plays are The White Devil and The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Brachiano and Vittoria Corombona ( both married to other people ) , indulge in a love affair . The Duke has his wife and her husband murdered , which results in a whole series of revenge murders . In The Duchess of Malfi , the widowed duchess marries Antonio , against the wishes of her two brothers who regard him as socially inferior . The result is unbelievable violence and a blood-drenched stage . <p> These two plays are often quoted as the prime examples of the fashion for extreme violence in Jacobean theatre . Webster was not afraid of tackling the darker side of human nature and the extremes to which human beings are prepared to go in pursuit of their ends . However , although Websters plays include adultery , murder , treachery , and Machiavellian plots , he does n't  write that way to shock : his plays show the real , unpleasant , truths about life . They are about class , justice , love and lust , religion , politics , sibling relations , and immorality in the courts . His plays are shocking , gripping and enthralling .

The British literary critic , Martin Seymour-Smith , named it as one of the hundred most influential books ever written . It is included in the Encyclopaedia Britannica 's Great Books of the Western World . The novel has influenced modern writers of dark satirical humour such as Joseph Heller , Thomas Pynchon , Terry Southern and Kurt Vonnegut . Its brand of parody and the picaresque methods Voltaire uses have become standard techniques of black humorists . <p> Voltaire was a versatile writer , writing in almost every literary form including plays , poems , novels , essays , and historical and scientific works .

The Voltaire scholar , Hadyn Mason , cites similarities between Candide and Samuel Becket 's Waiting for Godot . Becket has acknowledged the influence of Voltaire on his work . Several novelists have based their novels more squarely on Candide .

No English novelist has since bettered them and the novel has n't developed much since her definitive examples of the form . That is amazing when one thinks about how the other art forms " painting , music , architecture fall out of fashion with each generation , and give way to new forms .

She reveals the little preoccupations and concerns of the ladies and the gentlemen and the young women in those circles , and she leads us to laugh at them .

It has something to do with the way she constructs sentences " all perfectly balanced and often with a sting in the tail , and a style of narration in which the variety of points of view of the different characters tell the story . It is perhaps that latter characteristic that makes her such a modern writer " indeed , a postmodern writer as her stories are usually told with her pretending to be the narrator , but she is not , and we fall into the trap of taking her narrator seriously .

' Jane Austen uses that plot but her exploration of people , their class and their community while doing so goes very far beyond the novels that are read for their romantic story alone . <p> We have an image of Jane Austen as a spinster who lived quietly with her mother and sister and wrote her novels in semi-secrecy , hiding her pages away if she heard anyone approaching while she was writing . Most of what we know about her was written by family members after her death and so we know only the sweet , quiet , Aunt Jane .

He married Mary Arden , who had no formal education at all . <p> Young William was their third child , and they were to go on to have five more . The family lived in a town house right in the middle of Stratford . John used one of the downstairs rooms as a workshop and displayed his gloves on the sills of the windows , which looked out on to the high street . Like his father , William made something of himself in the world in spite of the lack of formal education , which amounted , as was the case with his father , to a few years in a public school .

But during his lifetime London was full of writers , some more highly regarded than he was . It 's sometimes forgotten that Shakespeare was a great entrepreneur : he built and managed theatres and companies of actors , and that 's where he made the good living he and his family enjoyed . As far as he was concerned his play writing was a job that had to be done to fill the theatres every day . The second half of the sixteenth century and the first decade of the seventeenth is often referred to as the golden age of English drama . That 's because theatre was very popular during that time , and like television today , it had a voracious appetite . Consequently , a great number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Playwrights today may produce a play once a year but the Elizabethan writers had to write much faster than that to cope with the demand and fight the competition . <p> By the middle of his writing career Shakespeare was famous . His plays were not only being performed in the theatre but also at court , not only for Queen Elizabeth but also for her successor , King James 1 . One of his plays , Troilus and Cressida , was written for , and performed at , Oxford University . He became prosperous and bought New Place , one of the finest houses in Stratford .

He retired to Stratford in 1612 and lived quietly , enjoying family and friends , and collaborating with younger playwrights on some plays until his death at fifty-two in 1616 . <p> Judging by the number of plays he wrote , Shakespeare worked very hard during his London years . It 's difficult to imagine how he had time to read and to travel backwards and forwards to see his family . While they led a stable life in Stratford he moved around .

Not only that , but this is the period when he started work on the sonnets . During this time , too , in 1597 , his son Hamnet died . <p> In 1599 we find him on the other side of the river , in Bankside , on property owned by the Bishop of Winchester estate , near the infamous prison , The Clink , where the Globe Theatre was built .

@@34527858 @3527858/ <p> Poet Ben Jonson was a towering figure among the English writers of the late 16th and early 17th centuries . Although William Shakespeare is now regarded as the most significant writer of the time , and indeed , of all time , Jonson dominated the playwriting scene during that period . <p> He was a satirist , playwright , poet and essayist and he was , in fact , the consummate writer . He was a very different kind of writer than Shakespeare , with an interest in the failings and stupidity of authority , dealing with those things in a far more overtly political , satirical way than Shakespeare did . That got him into trouble with the authorities : in 1597 he was imprisoned in the Fleet prison for his involvement in a satire , The Isle of Dogs . <p> Ben Jonson- was born in 1572 and educated at Westminster School .

It is the one play , apart from his role as the ghost in Hamlet , that we know included Shakespeare in the cast , although we do not know which role he played . The play made Jonson a celebrity and from there he became the great literary figure of the age . <p> He was imprisoned again in 1603 . His classical tragedy , Sejanus , His Fall , about dictatorship , was a bit too close for comfort for authority and he was called before the Privy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He got off for that but the authorities hounded him and he was imprisoned with two other writers , Marston and Chapman for controversial views . ' <p> The masque , a theatre form that combined all the arts " music , drama , art , dance " became fashionable at the beginning of the 17th- century , and Jonson immersed himself in writing masques and became the leading pioneer of the form . He had a strong following among other writers , including Shakespeare , and finally he became a respectable citizen in the eyes of the authorities , even being appointed poet laureate in 1616 , with a substantial pension . <p> He died in 1637 aged 65 after having been incapacitated by a stroke nine years previously . His tomb in Westminster Abbey is inscribed with the simple text : O rare Ben Jonson .

They wear expensive outfits , drive fancy- sports cars- and wield big shiny guns . The fight at the beginning of the play becomes a spectacular gunfight at a petrol station and the party at the Capulet mansion is a sumptuous rock-star style bash . Deafening pop music plays throughout . <p> The difficulty Luhrmann has to confront is the need to marry his cinematic vision with the language of Shakespeare , and he does this admirably . The key is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shakespeare 's blank verse iambic pentameter was written as a way of imitating the rhythms of natural speech and all of the actors expoit that quality in the poetry to create that effect .

Danes 's yearning Juliet is- exactly- right for a strong determined young girl caught up in this powerful emotional swirl . Paul Sorvino as Capulet presents a convincing modern tycoon who ca n't understand any form of dissent from his authority and Pete Postlethwaite 's hippy guru , Friar Laurence , is a joy . <p> Anyone coming to Shakespeare for the first time will enjoy this film but there is an extra dimension of enjoyment for those who know the play . Some of the character motivations are obscured by Luhrmann 's desire to realise his cinematic vision but knowledge of the play would make everything clear . This movie is a rich addition to the canon of Romeo &amp; Juliet films .

@@34527915 @3527915/ <h> Ernest Hemminway ( 1899 " 1961 ) <p> Ernest Hemingwaywas a novelist , short story writer , and journalist . He published seven novels , six short story collections , and two non-fiction works , and won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954 . More works , including three novels , four short story collections , and three non-fiction works , were published posthumously . Several of his works are now classics of American literature . In 1961 , like his father , a brother and a sister , Hemingway committed suicide . A niece , Margaux Hemingway , the Holywood star , also committed suicide . <p> What places Hemingway among the twenty top American writers is the style he developed , that set the benchmark for 20th century prose writing in the whole of the English speaking world . He changed the nature of American writing by reacting against the elaborate style of 19th century writers and by creating a style , in the words of literary critic , Henry Louis Gates , of Harvard , in which meaning is established through dialogue , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucial " or at least very little " is stated explicitly . ' <p> When Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize , the citation commented that it was for his mastery of the art of narrative , most recently demonstrated in The Old Man and the Sea , and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style . ' His first novel , The Sun Also Rises is written in the minimal , lean , muscular , stripped-down prose for which he became famous and which influenced the writers who came after him . <p> Perhaps most famous for his war novel , For Whom the Bell Tolls , he began his fiction writing with short stories , in which he taught himself how to edit his prose , stripping it to the bone and creating a greater intensity by the omission rather than the inclusion of detail . The result is to create significant connections and meaning beneath the surface of a sparse , apparently simple , almost monosyllabic narrative , using the simple sentences that a child might use . He also employs cinematic techniques such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of splicing one scene into another . Intentional scene omissions allow the reader to fill in the gap , creating for herself a three dimensional prose . As a result of that example it became almost impossible for 20th Century fiction writers to revert to the kind of prose that preceded Hemingway 's . <p> It was n't just writers and critics that showed enthusiasm for Hemingway 's works : he had a huge following among general fiction readers . His universal themes of love , death , war and loss permeate his writings in the same way that they did that of Shakespeare - and many other great writers , as well as being recurring themes in American literature . - The critic , Susan Beegel , in spite of an objection to what she sees as an anti-semitic , homophobic thread in his works , sums it up thus : Throughout his remarkable body of fiction , he tells the truth about human fear , guilt , betrayal , violence , cruelty , drunkenness , hunger , greed , apathy , ecstasy , tenderness , love and lust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the popular culture is testament to his significance as a 20th century literary figure . There are several bars named Harry 's Bar ' around the world , in recognition of the bar in the novel Across the River and Into the Trees . There are also many restaurant 's called Hemingway 's . ' A line of furniture includes the Kilimanjaro bedside table ' and a Catherine ' sofa ; a line of Hemingway safari clothes has been created and there is an expensive Hemingway fountain pen . His - novels have been made into films , sometimes more than once , and several short stories have been adapted for film and television .

He was as prominent in his other pursuits but they were not areas of life where we can still see him today . We see him as the author of such classics as Oliver Twist , David Copperfield , Great Expectations , A Tale of Two Cities , Bleak House and many others . All of his novels are English classics . <p> Dickens had an almost unbelievable level of energy . In addition to writing all those lengthy books in long-hand , he had time to pursue what would have been full-time careers for most people in acting , literary editing social campaigning and philanthropic administration .

Many of his novels reveal the cold hard facts of the Victorian prison system and , with so many readers , the novels had a great effect on the consciousness of the public . In addition to that Dickens campaigned and lobbied for reform . <p> Dickens was a man who seemed to be able to direct his efforts in several directions and give each his full attention .

Shakespeare came from a respectable background and would have been expected to follow in his father 's footsteps and take up a trade in Stratford , and perhaps enter into local political life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , here he was , in a strange and , to some , terrifying , place , associating with down-market people . One theory is that he fled from Stratford due to poaching activities that had got him into trouble and he ran away to avoid prosecution . <p> Possibly . But why London ? London players often toured and it is known that Stratford had frequent visits from theatre companies . Given that Shakespeare turned out to be the greatest playwright in history it is reasonable to think that he would have been interested in plays and their performances from an early age . Perhaps he went to a performance , got chatting to members of the company and , wanting to get away from Stratford , joined them and began his acting apprenticeship at that point . Leaving his wife and children looks like a fairly desperate move so that lends credibility to the idea that he was in a hurry to get out of town . And then we do n't hear anything about him because it would have taken him quite a few years to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent young man with a huge talent for writing , meeting so many hard working , also talented , writers gathered into a closed community in London 's theatreland , he was given the opportunity to join them and work with them . And then , seven years after joining them , we hear of him as a blossoming London dramatist and we begin to have sightings of him , and comments about him from fellow actors and playwrights . And the rest is history . <p> However , speculation about those years abound . Theories range from his having been a teacher , having enlisted in the army and having been in Italy , but none of them are based on any evidence , and have no credibility . Such theories assert , as evidenced in his plays , that he knew a lot about such things as military affairs and Italy , but he is also known to have been a great reader so knowledge about those things could have been acquired by reading , in the same way as his very extensive knowledge of history was acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a soldier or a teacher or an Italian tourist does n't make sense as we should remember that in order to produce the incredible creative output that we know Shakespeare produced means that he must have done very little else but write plays . And it is n't possible suddenly to become such a dazzling star out of nowhere without a lot of groundwork , so he must have been working hard at writing and learning about theatre writing during those seven years . His native poetic genius is one thing but channelling it into a commercial mode " bestselling plays that would bring the audiences in in droves requires years of hard work .

There 's some real substance in this if he 's angry . ' <p> Please do so , ' said Desdemona . <p> When he had gone Desdemona shook her head . She appealed to Emilia .

Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young , Although I know my years be past the best , I , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with loves i 'll rest . But wherefore says my love that she is young ? And wherefore say not I that I am old ? O , loves best habits in a soothing tongue , And age , in love , loves not to have years told . Therefore Ill lie with love , and love with me , Since that our faults in love thus smothered be . <p> - <h> II . Two loves I have , of comfort and despair <p> Two loves I have , of comfort and despair , That like two spirits do suggest me still : My better angel is a man ( right fair ) , My worser spirit a woman ( coloured i 'll ) . To win me soon to hell , my female evil Tempteth my better angel from my side , And would corrupt my saint to be a devil , Wooing his purity with her fair pride . And whether that my angel be turned fiend , Suspect I may ( yet not directly tell ) : For being both to me , both to each , friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth I shall not know , but live in doubt , Till my bad angel fire my good one out . <h> III . Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye <p> Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye , Gainst whom the world could not hold argument , Persuade my heart to this false perjury ? Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment . A woman I forswore ; but I will prove , Thou being a goddess , I forswore not thee : My vow was earthly , thou a heavenly love ; Thy grace being gained cures all disgrace in me . My vow was breath , and breath a vapour is ; Then thou , fair sun , that on this earth doth shine , Exhale this vapour vow ; in thee it is : If broken , then it is no fault of mine . If by me broke , what fool is not so wise To break an oath , to win a paradise ? <h> IV . Sweet Cytherea , sitting by a brook <p> Sweet Cytherea , sitting by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Did court the lad with many a lovely look , Such looks as none could look but beautys queen . She told him stories to delight his ear ; She showed him favours to allure his eye ; To win his heart , she touched him here and there , Touches so soft still conquer chastity . But whether unripe years did want conceit , Or he refused to take her figured proffer , The tender nibbler would not touch the bait , But smile and jest at every gentle offer : Then fell she on her back , fair queen , and toward : He rose and ran away ; ah , fool too froward ! <h> V. If love make me forsworn , how shall I swear to love ? <p> If love make me forsworn , how shall I swear to love ? O , never faith could hold , if not to beauty vowed : Though to myself forsworn , to thee Ill constant prove ; Those thoughts , to me like oaks , to thee like osiers bowed . Study his bias leaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasures live that art can comprehend . If knowledge be the mark , to know thee shall suffice ; Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend ; All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder ; Which is to me some praise , that I thy parts admire : Thy eye Joves lightning seems , thy voice his dreadful thunder , Which ( not to anger bent ) is music and sweet fire . Celestial as thou art , O , do not love that wrong , To sing heavens praise with such an earthly tongue . <h> VI . Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn <p> Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn , And scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade , When Cytherea ( all in love forlorn ) A longing tarriance for Adonis made , Under an osier growing by a brook , A brook where Adon used to cool his spleen . Hot was the day ; she hotter that did look For his approach that often there had been . Anon he comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the brooks green brim . The sun looked on the world with glorious eye , Yet not so wistly as this queen on him . He , spying her , bounced in whereas he stood ; " O Jove , " quoth she , " why was not I a flood ? " <h> VII . Fair is my love , but not so fair as fickle <p> Fair is my love , but not so fair as fickle ; Mild as a dove , but neither true nor trusty ; Brighter than glass , and yet , as glass is , brittle ; Softer than wax , and yet , as iron , rusty : A lily pale , with damask dye to grace her , None fairer , nor none falser to deface her . <p> Her lips to mine how often hath she joined , Between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing . How many tales to please me hath she coined , Dreading my love , the loss thereof still fearing . Yet in the midst of all her pure protestings , Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were jestings . <p> She burned with love , as straw with fire flameth ; She burned out love , as soon as straw outburneth ; She framed the love , and yet she foiled the framing ; She bade love last , and yet she fell a-turning . Was this a lover , or a lecher whether ? Bad in the best , though excellent in neither . <h> VIII . If music and sweet poetry agree <p> If music and sweet poetry agree , As they must needs ( the sister and the brother ) , Then must the love be great twixt thee and me , Because thou lovst the one , and I the other . Dowland to thee is dear , whose heavenly touch Upon the lute doth ravish human sense ; Spenser to me , whose deep conceit is such As passing all conceit needs no defence . Thou lovst to hear the sweet melodious sound That Phoebus lute ( the queen of music ) makes ; And I in deep delight am chiefly drowned When as himself to singing he betakes . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One knight loves both , and both in thee remain . <h> IX . Fair was the morn when the fair queen of love <p> Fair was the morn when the fair queen of love , Paler for sorrow than her milk-white dove , For Adons sake , a youngster proud and wild , Her stand she takes upon a steep-up hill . Anon Adonis comes with horn and hounds ; She , silly queen , with more than loves good will , Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds : " Once , " quoth she , " did I see a fair sweet youth Here in these brakes deep wounded with a boar , Deep in the thigh , a spectacle of ruth . See in my thigh , " quoth she , " here was the sore . " She showed hers ; he saw more wounds than one , And blushing fled , and left her all alone . <p> I weep for thee , and yet no cause I have ; For why thou leftst me nothing in thy will . And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I craved nothing of thee still : O yes ( dear friend ) I pardon crave of thee , Thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me . <h> XI . Venus , with young Adonis sitting by her <p> Venus , with young Adonis sitting by her Under a myrtle shade , began to woo him . She told the youngling how god Mars did try her , And as he fell to her , she fell to him . " Even thus , " quoth she , " the warlike god embraced me , " And then she clippd Adonis in her arms ; " Even thus , " quoth she , " the warlike god unlaced me , " As if the boy should use like loving charms . " Even thus , " quoth she , " he seized on my lips , " And with her lips on his did act the seizure . And as she fetch+d breath , away he skips , And would not take her meaning nor her pleasure . Ah ! that I had my lady at this bay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> XII . Crabbed age and youth can not live together <p> Crabbed age and youth can not live together : Youth is full of pleasance , age is full of care ; Youth like summer morn , age like winter weather ; Youth like summer brave , age like winter bare . Youth is full of sport , ages breath is short ; Youth is nimble , age is lame ; Youth is hot and bold , age is weak and cold ; Youth is wild , and age is tame . Age , I do abhor thee , youth , I do adore thee ; O my love , my love is young . Age , I do defy thee . O , sweet shepherd , hie thee , For methinks thou stays too long . <h> XIII . Beauty is but a vain and doubtful good <p> Beauty is but a vain and doubtful good , A shining gloss that vadeth suddenly , A flower that dies when first it gins to bud , A brittle glass that 's broken presently , A doubtful good , a gloss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , broken , dead within an hour . <p> And as goods lost are seld or never found , As vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh , As flowers dead lie withered on the ground , As broken glass no cement can redress , So beauty blemished once , forever lost , In spite of physic , painting , pain and cost . <h> XIV . Good-night , good rest , ah , neither be my share <p> Good-night , good rest , ah , neither be my share . She bade good-night that kept my rest away And daffed me to a cabin hanged with care , To descant on the doubts of my decay . " Farewell , " quoth she , " and come again tomorrow . " Fare well I could not , for I supped with sorrow ; <p> Yet at my parting sweetly did she smile , In scorn or friendship , nill I construe whether ; T may be , she joyed to jest at my exile , T may be , again to make me wander thither : " Wander , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain but can not pluck the pelf . <p> Lord , how mine eyes throw gazes to the east !

Heart hath his hope , and eyes their wished sight ; Sorrow changed to solace , and solace mixed with sorrow ; For why , she sighed and bade me come tomorrow . <p> Were I with her , the night would post too soon , But now are minutes added to the hours .

Long was the combat doubtful , that love with love did fight , To leave the master loveless , or kill the gallant knight ; To put in practice either , alas it was a spite Unto the silly damsel . But one must be refus+d ; more mickle was the pain , That nothing could be used to turn them both to gain , For of the two the trusty knight was wounded with disdain , Alas , she could not help it . Thus art with arms contending was victor of the day , Which by a gift of learning did bear the maid away : Then , lullaby , the learned man hath got the lady gay , For now my song is ended . <h> XVI . On a day ( alack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day ) Love , whose month was ever May , Spied a blossom passing fair , Playing in the wanton air . Through the velvet leaves the wind All unseen , gan passage find ; That the lover ( sick to death ) Wished himself the heavens breath .

But ( alas ) my hand hath sworn Neer to pluck thee from thy thorn : Vow ( alack ) for youth unmeet ; Youth , so apt to pluck a sweet . Thou for whom Jove would swear Juno but an Ethiope were ; And deny himself for Jove , Turning mortal for thy love . " <h> XVII .

She ( poor bird ) as all forlorn , Leaned her breast up-till a thorn , And there sung the dolefullst ditty , That to hear it was great pity . " Fie , fie , fie , " now would she cry ; " Tereu , tereu , " by and by ; That to hear her so complain , Scarce I could from tears refrain , For her griefs so lively shown , Made me think upon mine own .

@@34527935 @3527935/ <h> Tennessee Williams ( 1911 1983 ) <p> Thomas Lanier Williams III , known as Tennessee Williams is one of America 's most popular playwrights , and now regarded as one of the most significant writers of the twentieth century . He wrote more than thirty plays , some of which have become classis of Western drama . He also wrote novels and short stories but is known almost exclusively for his plays . <p> His genius was in the honesty with which he represented society and the art of presenting that in the form of absorbing drama . The plays offer a stark picture of the prejudices of the American south , acknowledging economic realities and exploring social conditions that were taboo when he began writing , such as homosexuality and domestic violence . He was an admirer of Chekhov and influenced by him . Like Chekhov he was able to represent tragic situations that are also funny . The plays portray America at its worst while at the same time showing the human condition as absurd , for all of the suffering . Williams ' most famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written in 1947 , received the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1948 .

She has just lost the family property to creditors . She is shocked to find that her sister and her husband live in a rundown apartment . Also that Stanley is coarse and vulgar . Stella , who is now pregnant , was attracted by his hypermasculinity , which manifests itself in physical outbursts and vulgarity. - Blanche is repulsed by him . Stanley , a labourer , finds Blanche affected , full or airs and graces , and he suspects that she has sold the family property , Belle Reve , and is withholding Stellas share of the proceeds .

Stanleys desire to find out the truth about Belle Reve and Blanches life in Auriol , affects the interrelationships between Stanley , Blanche , Stella and Mitch in a way that threatens to destroy what 's left of Blanches already delicate mental state . <p> Three years before that Williams wrote another play that has also become a classic of American theatre " The Glass Menagerie . He continued to write plays , several of which take their place as America 's most popular and regularly performed plays plays such as Cat on a Hot Tin Roof , Sweet Bird of Youth , and Suddenly Last Summer . <p> In 2009 , Williams was inducted into the Poets Corner at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine in New York . The Tennessee Williams Theatre in Key West , Florida , is named after him .

Williams was honoured by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its literary arts series . He was also honoured with a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame .

The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment : Good Captain Blunt , bear my good night to him And by the second hour in the morning Desire the earl to see me in my tent : Yet one thing more , good Blunt , before thou gost , Where is Lord Stanley quarterd , dost thou know ? <p> BLUNT <p> Unless I have mistaen his colours much , Which well I am assured I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least South from the mighty power of the king . <p> RICHMOND <p> If without peril it be possible , Good Captain Blunt , bear my good-night to him , And give him from me this most needful scroll . <p> I , by attorney , bless thee from thy mother Who prays continually for Richmonds good : So much for that . The silent hours steal on , And flaky darkness breaks within the east . In brief , for so the season bids us be , Prepare thy battle early in the morning , And put thy fortune to the arbitrement Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war . I , as I maythat which I would I can not , With best advantage will deceive the time , And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms : But on thy side I may not be too forward Lest , being seen , thy brother , tender George , Be executed in his fathers sight .

Once more , adieu : be valiant , and speed well ! <p> RICHMOND <p> Good lords , conduct him to his regiment : I 'll strive , with troubled thoughts , to take a nap , Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow , When I should mount with wings of victory : Once more , good night , kind lords and gentlemen . <p> - - - Exeunt all but RICHMOND O Thou , whose captain I account myself , Look on my forces with a gracious eye ; Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath , That they may crush down with a heavy fall The usurping helmets of our adversaries ! Make us thy ministers of chastisement , That we may praise thee in the victory !

I am a villain : yet I lie . I am not . Fool , of thyself speak well : fool , do not flatter . My conscience hath a thousand several tongues , And every tongue brings in a several tale , And every tale condemns me for a villain . Perjury , perjury , in the highst degree Murder , stem murder , in the direst degree ; All several sins , all used in each degree , Throng to the bar , crying all , Guilty ! guilty !

Then , in the name of God and all these rights , Advance your standards , draw your willing swords .

Call up Lord Stanley , bid him bring his power : I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain , And thus my battle shall be ordered : My foreward shall be drawn out all in length , Consisting equally of horse and foot ; Our archers shall be placed in the midst John Duke of Norfolk , Thomas Earl of Surrey , Shall have the leading of this foot and horse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main battle , whose puissance on either side Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse .

A thing devised by the enemy . Go , gentleman , every man unto his charge Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls : Conscience is but a word that cowards use , Devised at first to keep the strong in awe : Our strong arms be our conscience , swords our law . March on , join bravely , let us tot pell-mell If not to heaven , then hand in hand to hell . <p> - - - His oration to his Army What shall I say more than I have inferrd ? Remember whom you are to cope withal ; A sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bretons , and base lackey peasants , Whom their oer-cloyed country vomits forth To desperate ventures and assured destruction . You sleeping safe , they bring to you unrest ; You having lands , and blest with beauteous wives , They would restrain the one , distain the other . And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow , Long kept in Bretagne at our mothers cost ? A milk-sop , one that never in his life Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow ? Let 's whip these stragglers oer the seas again ; Lash hence these overweening rags of France , These famishd beggars , weary of their lives ; Who , but for dreaming on this fond exploit , For want of means , poor rats , had hangd themselves : If we be conquerd , let men conquer us , And not these bastard Bretons ; whom our fathers Have in their own land beaten , bobbd , and thumpd , And in record , left them the heirs of shame . Shall these enjoy our lands ? lie with our wives ? Ravish our daughters ?

He was seen but with eyes so dulled with familiarity that they failed to light up as they should when gazing on sun-like majesty that shines in admiring eyes only on a few occasions .

The most one can say is that his work has inspired countless writers , none of whom have come close to capturing the magic of his work . He wrote poems but is famous for , and remembered for , his prose " short pieces , what one may call short stories but which he called fictions . ' <p> His fictions have been labelled postmodern , ' because they depart from the conventions of modern short fiction forms . For example , Borges almost completely eliminates narrative . He generally dispenses with plot unless he wants to exploit the actual concept of plot for the purpose of doing something unconventional with it . He omits such features of fiction as sequence , causation and character relationships , thereby challenging our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our expectations of fiction generally . At the same time the fictions are fascinating , interesting to read and attention grabbing . The uniqueness of his fictions and the influence they had on the work of subsequent writers places him squarely in this category of the world 's greatest all time writers . The philosophical term Borgesian conundrum ' is named after him . The term refers to whether the writer writes the story , or the story writes him . <p> Borges published his masterpiece , Ficciones , in 1944 : it comprises seventeen short stories that explore the labyrinthine nature of reality . Labyrinths are a major theme in his work , the idea that life is made up of recurring , inexplicable , repetitive versions of our perception of reality . There are many stories about the way in which the imaginary world impacts on what we think of as the real world " such as reviews of imaginary books written by imaginary authors , which is a recurrent device in Borges .

The Italian writer paid tribute to Borges in his acclaimed novel The Name of the Rose with the character Jorge de Burgos " a blind monk . In addition , the devices he used in his fictions have been something of a textbook for a generation of writers of postmodern fiction .

Some critics also maintain that some sonnets are unfinished and that the sequence is too incoherent to have been intended for publication . <p> Exponents of this view have argued that someone whom Shakespeare trusted betrayed him by giving the poems to their first publisher , Thomas Thope , or that a theif , perhaps motivated by anomisity or personal profit , siezed the poets manuscript and sold it on . Some hold that the publication of the sonnets surely upset Shakespeare , whose poems dealt with scandlaous forms of love ; homoerotic and adulterous . Others variously insist that these subjects are more shocking to post-Victorian readers than to Jacobean ones ; that , whilst the sonnets voice strong feelings , these were entirley appropriate to the form ; and that emotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those of dramatic characters in his plays . <p> Certain features of the sonnet form not least the first person narrative and themes of love do give the impression of offering direct access to their authors inner world . Since there has long been intense curiosity about the youth addressed in the sonnets , clues to his identity have also been extracted with no little strain from the frontispiece of the first edition . The author of this dedication , T.T , was Thomas Thorpe , the publisher . But the identity of the " begetter " of the sonnets , " Mr W. H. " remains a mystery . Some think this is a misprint for " Mr W. S. " or " Mr W. Sh . " , as in WIiliam Shakespeare . Others suspect that the " begetter " refers to the scoundrel who may have conveyed the poems to Thorpe against Shakespeares wishes. - But the most wideley held assumption is that the " beggetter " must be the person who inspired the " ensuing sonnets " , the majority of which address a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initials W. H. , literary dtectives have proposed many cnadidates . One is Henry Wriothesley , Earl of Southampton , to whom Shakespeare dedicated Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece in the mid-1590s . Another is William Herbert , Earl of Pembroke , whose name figures among those to whom the First Folio was dedicated in 1623 . A third candidate is Sir William Hervey , stepfather of the Earl of Southampton , who may hve commissioned lyrics urging the young man to marry and produce an heir the first 17 sonnets o fthe sequence treat this theme . Of these candidates , however two were earls and one was a gentleman , referred to as " Sir " . None would have been called " Mr " save by error or to suggest intimacy . In the end , these probing enigmas of Shakespeares sonnets are forced to speculate ; information is poor , scarce and inconlcusive. 
@@34527974 @3527974/ <p> Fluellen was beside himself with rage . To kill the boys and all the other camp civilians ! he fumed to Gower . Its expressly against the rules of war . Its the worst kind of villainy , look you , that can be imagined . Tell me now , is n't it ? <p> One things certain , said Gower , there 's not a boy left alive . The cowardly rascals who ran away from the battle have done this slaughter . They have also burned and carried off everything that was in the Kings tent . So the King has quite rightly ordered every soldier to cut his prisoners throat . Oh he s a great king ! <p> Yes . He was born at Monmouth . Er , Captain Gower , what was the name of the town where Alexander the Big was born ? <p> Alexander the Great ? said Gower . <p> Why , pray , does n't  Big mean Great ? The big or the great or the mighty or the huge or the magnanimous : they are all the same " just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macedon . His father was Philip of Macedon , I understand. <p> I think it was , indeed , Macedon where Alexander was born , said Fluellen . I can tell you , Captain , if you look at the maps of the world , I 'll bet you 'll find , in comparisons between Macedon and Monmouth , that the situations is , look you , both alike . There is a river in Macedon , and there is also , moreover , a river at Monmouth . It is called Wye at Monmouth but I cant remember what is the name of the other river . but it does n't  matter : its as alike as my fingers are to each other , and there 's salmon in both . If you think about Alexanders life Harry of Monmouths life resembles it uncannily . For there are parallels in everything . Alexander , God knows " and you know too " in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his cholers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations , and also being a bit pissed out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill his best friend Cleitus <p> Our King is nothing like him in that , Gower interrupted . He never killed any of his friends. <p> Its discourteous , look you now , to stop my story before its finished , said Fluellen . I 'm only speaking figuratively and metaphorically . In the same way that Alexander killed his friend Cleitus while drunk , so Harry Monmouth , being sober and clear in judgment , turned away the fat knight with the enormous belly . He was full of jokes and jibes and mischief and mockery Ive forgotten his name <p> Sir John Falstaff , Gower told him . <p> That 's the one . I tell you , there are good men born at Monmouth. <p> A trumpet fanfare brought their conversation to an end . Here comes his majesty , said Gower as the Kings party came to a halt . <p> I have not been angry since I came to France , until this moment , said King Henry . Take a trumpet , Herald . Ride to the horsemen on that hill over there . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Or get off of the field : the sight of them offends me . If theyll do neither well go to them and make them move away as fast as stones flung from the old Assyrian slings . And what 's more , well cut the throats of the prisoners we have and not a single man will have any mercy from us . Go and tell them that. <p> Montjoy , who had said that he would not come to King Henry again , was approaching . <p> Here comes the herald of the French , my liege , said Exeter . <p> He does n't  have such an arrogant look anymore. said Gloucester . <p> Well hello , said Henry . What can this mean , Herald ? Do n't  you know that I 've pledged only these bones of mine as a ransom ? He smiled . Have you come back to talk about ransom money again ? <p> No , great King , said Montjoy . Ive come to you for permission to wander around this bloody field to make a record of our dead and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men because many of our princes , unfortunately , lie drowned and soaked in the blood of mercenaries . In the same way our low-born drench their peasant limbs with the blood of princes , and our wounded horses writhe fetlock-deep in gore , kicking out at their dead masters with their steel-shod hooves in their wild rage , killing them again . Oh allow us , great King , to view the battlefield in safety and dispose of the dead bodies. <p> Henry was thoughtful . To tell you the truth , Herald , I do n't  know whether we 've won the day or not , because many of your horsemen still appear to be galloping across the battlefield. <p> Youve won the day , said Montjoy confidently . <p> Praise be to God , not our army , for that , said Henry . What 's that castle called that stands nearby ? Its called Agincourt , said Montjoy . <p> Then well call this the battle of Agincourt , fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus , said Henry . <p> Fluellen found that very satisfying . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your great uncle Edward the Black Prince of Wales , according to what Ive read in history books , fought a ferocious battle here , he said . <p> They did , Fluellen , said Henry . <p> Your Majesty is right , said Fluellen . If Your Majesty recalls , the Welsh fought well on a battlefield where leeks were growing , wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps , which Your Majesty knows is an honourable badge of service to this day . And I do believe Your Majesty is n't ashamed to wear the leek on St Davids day. <p> I wear it as a token of respect , said Henry , because I am Welsh , you know , good countryman. <p> Fluellen bowed . All the water in the Wye can not wash Your Majestys Welsh blood out of your body , I can tell you that . God bless and preserve it , as long as it pleases Him , and Your Majesty too. <p> Thanks , my good countryman , said Henry . <p> Fluellen punched the air . By Jesus , I am Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I will admit it to all the world . I neednt be ashamed of Your Majesty , praise be to God , as long as Your Majesty remains an honest man. <p> The King laughed . God keep me so. He nodded toward Montjoy . Send our heralds with him . Bring me an accurate report of the death toll on both sides. He looked about and saw Williams among the soldiers , wearing his glove in his cap . Call that fellow here. <p> Exeter went over to Williams . Soldier , you must come to the King , he told him . <p> Henry looked him up and down . Soldier , he said , why are you wearing that glove in your cap ? <p> If it pleases Your Majesty , its the gauntlet of someone I have to fight if he s alive. <p> An Englishman ? said Henry . <p> If it pleases Your Majesty , a rascal , who bragged to me last night " who , if alive and ever dares to challenge this glove , Ive sworn to box his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap " which he swore , as a soldier , that he would wear if he lived " I will knock it out without hesitation. <p> Henry turned to Fluellen . What do you think , Captain Fluellen ? Should this soldier keep his oath ? <p> He s a coward and a villain if he does n't  , if it pleases Your Majesty , in my opinion. <p> It may be that his enemy is a gentleman of high rank and so unable to answer to a man of low degree. <p> Even if he s as fine a gentleman as the devil is , as Lucifer and Beelzebub himself , it is necessary , look Your Grace , that he keeps to his vow and his oath . If he perjures himself , see you now , he would have the reputation of being as arrant a villain and as cheeky a knave as ever trod on Gods ground and his earth in black shoes , in my opinion , the lord save me. <p> Then keep to your vow , man , when you meet the fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liege , on my life , said Williams . <p> Who is your commanding officer ? <p> Captain Gower , my liege. <p> Fluellen nodded enthusiastically . Gower is a good captain and is well experienced and literatured in warfare. <p> Call him here to me soldier , said Henry . <p> I will , my liege , said Williams , and he went off to get him . <p> Henry beckoned his baggage attendant and removed Williams glove from a bag . Here Fluellen , he said , wear this token for me " stick it in your cap . When the Duke of Alencon and I were in close combat I snatched this glove from his helmet . If any man challenges this he is a friend of Alencon and an enemy of mine . If you encounter any such man , arrest him if you love me. <p> Your Grace does me the greatest honour as can be desired in the hearts of his subjects. Fluellen took the glove . I would like to see any man on two legs that will find himself aggrieved at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please God in his grace to grant me that. <p> Do you know Gower ? said Henry . <p> He is my dear friend , as it pleases you. <p> Pray go seek him and bring him to my tent. <p> I will fetch him , said Fuellen . <p> Henry watched him go then spoke to the princes . My lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester , follow closely on Fluellens heels . The glove Ive given him to wear as a favour may perhaps get his ears boxed . It is the soldiers . Because of the bargain I made I should really wear it myself . Follow him , good cousin Warwick . If the soldier should strike him , and I think , judging by his blunt manner he will keep his word , there may be a sudden flare-up . I know Fluellen to be valiant , short tempered , as explosive as gunpowder , and he will quickly return an insult . Follw him and see that nothing happens between them . Come with me , Uncle
