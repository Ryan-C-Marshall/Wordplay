# Wordplay
A collection of functions, programs, and files to interact with word-based games like word hunt.

Currently, this collection solves GamePigeon's games Word Hunt and Anagrams. Building other programs with similar functionality would be straightforward within this infrastructure.

This code is meant to be modular; it is likely most useful when individual functions are taken to integrate with other projects.
